1	br-a01	1	1	1	The Fulton_County_Grand_Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta 's recent primary_election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took_place . 
2	br-a01	2	2	22	The jury further said in term end presentments that the City_Executive_Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City_of_Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . 
3	br-a01	3	3	62	The September October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior_Court_Judge_Durwood_Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate_Ivan_Allen_Jr. . 
4	br-a01	4	4	91	`` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of_this city '' . 
5	br-a01	5	5	127	The jury said it did find that many_of Georgia 's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . 
6	br-a01	6	6	151	It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . 
7	br-a01	7	7	175	The grand_jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton_County purchasing_departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . 
8	br-a01	8	8	215	However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . 
9	br-a01	9	9	241	The City_Purchasing_Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . 
10	br-a01	9	10	264	It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem . 
11	br-a01	10	11	278	Implementation of Georgia 's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . 
12	br-a01	11	12	293	It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so_that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' . 
13	br-a01	12	13	320	The grand_jury took_a_swipe_at the State_Welfare_Department 's handling of federal funds granted for child_welfare_services in foster_homes . 
14	br-a01	13	14	336	`` This is one of the major items in the Fulton_County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State_Welfare_Department `` has seen_fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton_County , which receives none of_this money . 
15	br-a01	14	15	389	The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' . 
16	br-a01	15	16	412	Nevertheless , `` we feel that in_the_future Fulton_County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said . 
17	br-a01	15	17	434	`` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers . 
18	br-a01	16	18	451	The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary 's court which has been under_fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation . 
19	br-a01	17	19	485	The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating_procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand_juries , the Atlanta_Bar_Association and an interim citizens_committee . 
20	br-a01	18	20	513	`` These actions should serve to protect in_fact and in_effect the court 's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . 
21	br-a01	19	21	545	Regarding Atlanta 's new million dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes_charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' . 
22	br-a01	20	22	579	The jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' . 
23	br-a01	21	23	612	On other matters , the jury recommended that : 
24	br-a01	22	24	621	Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton_County_Jail and `` a doctor , medical_intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' . 
25	br-a01	23	25	649	Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling_legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension plan for city employes . 
26	br-a01	24	26	676	The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police_Department , the Fulton_Tax_Commissioner_'s_Office , the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison_farms , Grady_Hospital and the Fulton_Health_Department . 
27	br-a01	25	27	702	Mayor_William_B._Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , Pearl_Williams_Hartsfield , in Fulton_Superior_Court Friday . 
28	br-a01	25	28	717	His petition charged mental cruelty . 
29	br-a01	26	29	723	The couple was married Aug. 2 , 1913 . 
30	br-a01	26	30	732	They have a son , William_Berry_Jr. , and a daughter , Mrs._J._M._Cheshire of Griffin . 
31	br-a01	27	31	747	Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property_settlement has been agreed_upon . 
32	br-a01	28	32	760	The petition listed the mayor 's occupation as `` attorney '' and his age as 71 . 
33	br-a01	28	33	777	It listed his wife 's age as 74 and place_of_birth as Opelika_,_Ala. . 
34	br-a01	29	34	790	The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man_and_wife for more than a year . 
35	br-a01	30	35	808	The Hartsfield home is at 637 E._Pelham_Rd._NE . 
36	br-a01	31	36	816	Henry_L._Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor 's attorney . 
37	br-a01	32	37	828	Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 . 
38	br-a01	32	38	845	His political career goes_back to his election to city_council in 1923 . 
39	br-a01	33	39	857	The mayor 's present term_of_office expires Jan. 1 . 
40	br-a01	33	40	866	He will be succeeded by Ivan_Allen_Jr. , who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor_Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection . 
41	br-a01	34	41	893	Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor_'s_race , a top official said Wednesday . 
42	br-a01	35	42	914	Robert_Snodgrass , state GOP chairman , said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue_Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience . 
43	br-a01	36	43	935	State_Party_Chairman_James_W._Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking_up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen._John_Tower will be the featured speaker . 
44	br-a01	37	44	964	In the Blue_Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting_precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . 
45	br-a01	38	45	996	Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according_to Republicans who attended . 
46	br-a01	39	46	1015	When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no - and there were no dissents . 
47	br-a01	40	47	1043	The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : 
48	br-a01	42	48	1074	Five per_cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general_election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system - a system which the party opposes in its platform . 
49	br-a01	43	49	1124	Sam_Caldwell , State_Highway_Department public_relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd 's campaign . 
50	br-a01	44	50	1139	Caldwell 's resignation had been expected for some time . 
51	br-a01	44	51	1149	He will be succeeded by Rob_Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years . 
52	br-a01	44	52	1168	When the gubernatorial campaign starts , Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd . 
53	br-a01	45	53	1185	The Georgia_Legislature will wind_up its 1961 session Monday and head for home - where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly . 
54	br-a01	46	54	1211	Before adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban_areas to determine what adjustments should be made . 
55	br-a01	47	55	1242	Gov._Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . 
56	br-a01	47	56	1259	Vandiver likely will mention the $ 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . 
57	br-a01	48	57	1281	Meanwhile , it was learned the State_Highway_Department is very near being ready to issue the first $ 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . 
58	br-a01	49	58	1306	The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test_suit to test the validity of the act , and_then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia 's most heavily traveled highways . 
59	br-a01	50	59	1348	A Highway_Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $ 3 million to $ 4 million worth of Rural_Roads_Authority bonds for rural road construction work . 
60	br-a01	51	60	1378	The department apparently intends to make the Rural_Roads_Authority a revolving_fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid_off by tax authorities . 
61	br-a01	52	61	1409	Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $ 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov._Marvin_Griffin . 
62	br-a01	53	62	1441	The Highway_Department source told The_Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . 
63	br-a01	54	63	1467	Schley_County_Rep._B._D._Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body 's action of Friday in voting itself a $ 10 per day increase in expense allowances . 
64	br-a01	55	64	1497	Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought . 
65	br-a01	56	65	1538	While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked_out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set_aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87 - 31 . 
66	br-a01	57	66	1568	A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29 - 5 . 
67	br-a01	57	67	1583	As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . 
68	br-a01	58	68	1603	Pelham pointed_out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . 
69	br-a01	59	69	1627	A veteran Jackson_County legislator will ask the Georgia_House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . 
70	br-a01	60	70	1652	Rep._Mac_Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided_that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . 
71	br-a01	61	71	1685	Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would_like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . 
72	br-a01	61	72	1721	But he added that none of Georgia 's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . 
73	br-a01	62	73	1738	The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . 
74	br-a01	62	74	1756	It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State_Board_of_Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises . 
75	br-a01	63	75	1788	After a long , hot controversy , Miller_County has a new school_superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election I ever saw in_this county '' . 
76	br-a01	64	76	1821	The new school_superintendent is Harry_Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix_Bush , a school_principal and chairman of the Miller_County_Democratic_Executive_Committee . 
77	br-a01	65	77	1844	Davis received 1119 votes in Saturday 's election , and Bush got 402 . 
78	br-a01	65	78	1858	Ordinary Carey_Williams , armed with a pistol , stood_by at the polls to insure order . 
79	br-a01	66	79	1874	`` This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw '' , Colquitt_Policeman_Tom_Williams said . 
80	br-a01	66	80	1890	`` Being at the polls was just like being at church . 
81	br-a01	66	81	1902	I did n't smell a drop of liquor , and we did n't have a_bit of trouble '' . 
82	br-a01	67	82	1921	The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however . 
83	br-a01	67	83	1934	It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone_calls and veiled threats of violence . 
84	br-a01	68	84	1949	The former county school_superintendent , George_P._Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school_board . 
85	br-a01	69	85	1978	During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone_calls . 
86	br-a01	69	86	1995	Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . 
87	br-a01	70	87	2014	Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election . 
88	br-a01	71	88	2043	Sheriff_Felix_Tabb said the ordinary apparently made_good his promise . 
89	br-a01	72	89	2052	`` Everything went real smooth '' , the sheriff said . 
90	br-a01	72	90	2063	`` There was n't a_bit of trouble '' . 
91	br-a02	1	1	2072	Committee approval of Gov._Price_Daniel 's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . 
92	br-a02	2	2	2093	Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered_down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House_Committee_on_Revenue_and_Taxation . 
93	br-a02	3	3	2123	Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . 
94	br-a02	3	4	2137	But questions with which committee_members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of_it . 
95	br-a02	4	5	2157	Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal_year next Aug. 31 . 
96	br-a02	5	6	2193	He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on_the_books `` since Texas was a republic '' . 
97	br-a02	5	7	2220	It permits the state to take_over bank_accounts , stocks and other personal_property of persons missing for seven years or more . 
98	br-a02	6	8	2241	The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance_firms , pipeline_companies and other corporations to report such property to the state_treasurer . 
99	br-a02	6	9	2269	The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . 
100	br-a02	7	10	2289	Dewey_Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas_Bankers_Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . 
101	br-a02	8	11	2324	`` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . 
102	br-a02	8	12	2343	`` You take out_of circulation many millions of dollars '' . 
103	br-a02	9	13	2354	Rep._Charles_E._Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would `` amount to making a gift out_of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline_companies '' . 
104	br-a02	10	14	2389	His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott_Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor_B._Jones of Houston , J._B._Brady of Harlingen and Howard_Cox of Austin . 
105	br-a02	11	15	2414	Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . 
106	br-a02	12	16	2434	He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . 
107	br-a02	13	17	2456	Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day_schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . 
108	br-a02	14	18	2482	The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . 
109	br-a02	15	19	2506	There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . 
110	br-a02	16	20	2521	It would authorize the Texas_Education_Agency to establish county-wide day_schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of_age to attend the day_schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas_School_for_the_Deaf here . 
111	br-a02	17	21	2565	Operating_budget for the day_schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El_Paso would be $ 451500 , which would be a savings of $ 157460 yearly after the first year 's capital outlay of $ 88000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . 
112	br-a02	18	22	2615	The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day_school in Dallas_County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school . 
113	br-a02	19	23	2644	Dallas may get_to hear a debate on horse_race parimutuels soon between Reps._V._E._Red_Berry and Joe_Ratcliff . 
114	br-a02	20	24	2659	While details are still be to worked_out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home_folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry 's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected . 
115	br-a02	21	25	2688	`` We 're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse_race betting '' , said Ratcliff . 
116	br-a02	21	26	2709	`` But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most_of them would oppose it also . 
117	br-a02	21	27	2729	I'm willing to stake my political career on_it '' . 
118	br-a02	22	28	2739	Rep._Berry , an ex_gambler from San_Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting_on the ponies . 
119	br-a02	22	29	2756	A House committee which heard his local_option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard_sledding later . 
120	br-a02	23	30	2780	The House passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State_Health_Department 's authority to give planning assistance to cities . 
121	br-a02	24	31	2805	The Senate quickly whipped_through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar . 
122	br-a02	24	32	2826	One validated acts of school districts . 
123	br-a02	24	33	2833	Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont_Navigation_District . 
124	br-a02	25	34	2840	The third amended the enabling_act for creation of the Lamar_county Hospital_District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted . 
125	br-a02	26	35	2862	Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen._A._R._Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally_retarded in the Gulf_Coast district . 
126	br-a02	26	36	2889	Money for its construction will be sought later_on but in_the_meantime the State_Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . 
127	br-a02	27	37	2911	Two tax revision bills were passed . 
128	br-a02	27	38	2918	One , by Sen._Louis_Crump of San_Saba , would aid more than 17000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise_taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized . 
129	br-a02	27	39	2948	Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $ 1000 fine . 
130	br-a02	27	40	2979	It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas_Research_League . 
131	br-a02	28	41	2991	The other bill , by Sen._A._M._Aikin_Jr. of Paris , would relieve real_estate_brokers , who pay their own annual licensing_fee , from the $ 12 annual occupation_license on brokers in such_as stocks and bonds . 
132	br-a02	29	42	3025	Natural_gas public_utility companies would be given the right of eminent_domain , under a bill by Sen._Frank_Owen /3 , of El_Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas . 
133	br-a02	30	43	3056	Marshall_Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas_Highway_Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections . 
134	br-a02	31	44	3089	Under Formby 's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant_governor , speaker of the House , attorney_general and chief_justice of the Texas_Supreme_Court . 
135	br-a02	32	45	3121	State representatives decided Thursday against taking_a_poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . 
136	br-a02	33	46	3138	An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State_Affairs_Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . 
137	br-a02	34	47	3170	Rep._Wesley_Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . 
138	br-a02	35	48	3192	The West_Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman_Bill_Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . 
139	br-a02	35	49	3214	The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . 
140	br-a02	36	50	3243	Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . 
141	br-a02	37	51	3266	All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep._Bill_Jones , who was absent . 
142	br-a02	38	52	3280	Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas ' big cities Thursday . 
143	br-a02	39	53	3294	Rep._James_Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water_development bill passed by the Texas House_of_Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort_Worth to cover_up places like Paradise , a Wise_County hamlet of 250 people . 
144	br-a02	40	54	3330	When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen._George_Parkhouse of Dallas . 
145	br-a02	41	55	3361	Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen._Parkhouse . 
146	br-a02	41	56	3374	The bill would increase from $ 5000000 to $ 15000000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water_project . 
147	br-a02	42	57	3396	Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . 
148	br-a02	43	58	3427	Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water_program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten 's attack . 
149	br-a02	44	59	3463	The bill 's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J._W._Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio_(_Kika_)_de_la_Garza of Mission , Sam_F._Collins of Newton and Joe_Chapman of Sulphur_Springs . 
150	br-a02	45	60	3488	`` This is a poor boy 's bill '' , said Chapman . 
151	br-a02	45	61	3501	`` Dallas and Fort_Worth can vote bonds . 
152	br-a02	45	62	3509	This would help the little peanut districts '' . 
153	br-a02	46	63	3518	A Houston teacher , now serving in the Legislature , proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods '' . 
154	br-a02	47	64	3542	Rep._Henry_C._Grover , who teaches history in the Houston public_schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester_hours the so-called `` teaching_methods '' courses required to obtain a junior or senior_high_school teaching_certificate . 
155	br-a02	47	65	3574	A normal year 's work in college is 30 semester_hours . 
156	br-a02	48	66	3585	Grover also would require junior senior_high teachers to have at_least 24 semester_hours credit in the subject they are teaching . 
157	br-a02	48	67	3605	The remainder of the 4 - year college requirement would be in_general subjects . 
158	br-a02	49	68	3619	`` A person with a master's_degree in physics , chemistry , math or English , yet who has not taken Education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public_schools '' , said Grover . 
159	br-a02	50	69	3655	College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses . 
160	br-a02	51	70	3668	Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal . 
161	br-a02	52	71	3682	The board_of_regents of Paris_Junior_College has named Dr._Clarence_Charles_Clark of Hays , Kan. as the school 's new president . 
162	br-a02	53	72	3700	Dr._Clark will succeed Dr._J._R._McLemore , who will retire at the close of the present school_term . 
163	br-a02	54	73	3716	Dr._Clark holds an earned Doctor_of_Education degree from the University_of_Oklahoma . 
164	br-a02	54	74	3726	He also received a Master_of_Science degree from Texas_A+I_College and a Bachelor_of_Science degree from Southwestern_State_College , Weatherford , Okla. . 
165	br-a02	55	75	3745	In_addition , Dr._Clark has studied at Rhode_Island_State_College and Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology . 
166	br-a02	56	76	3755	During his college career , Dr._Clark was captain of his basketball_team and was a football letterman . 
167	br-a02	57	77	3772	Dr._Clark has served as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high_schools , as teacher and athletic director at Raymondville_,_Texas_,_High_School , as an instructor at the University_of_Oklahoma , and as an associate_professor of education at Fort_Hays_,_Kan._,_State_College . 
168	br-a02	57	78	3807	He has served as a border_patrolman and was in the Signal_Corps of the U._S._Army . 
169	br-a02	58	79	3822	Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton_Independent_School_District have been re-elected for the 1961 - 62 session upon the recommendation of Supt._Chester_O._Strickland . 
170	br-a02	59	80	3845	State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called_for yesterday in a report of a `` blue_ribbon '' citizens_committee on the aid to dependent children program . 
171	br-a02	60	81	3874	The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New_York_City welfare consulting_firm , listed 10 long_range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case_load . 
172	br-a02	60	82	3907	The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . 
173	br-a02	61	83	3932	The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C._Virgil_Martin , president of Carson_Pirie_Scott_+_Co. , committee chairman . 
174	br-a02	62	84	3960	`` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend_upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . 
175	br-a02	63	85	3981	The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . 
176	br-a02	63	86	4015	These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' . 
177	br-a02	64	87	4036	Other recommendations made by the committee are : 
178	br-a02	65	88	4044	Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . 
179	br-a02	66	89	4071	Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy . 
180	br-a11	1	1	4087	The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League_clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas_City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . 
181	br-a11	2	2	4127	Indications as_late_as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory drought as they coasted along with a 3 - to-o advantage . 
182	br-a11	3	3	4155	Over the first five frames , Jack_Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in_the_middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American_League pennant , held the A 's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . 
183	br-a11	4	4	4194	Then Dick_Hyde , submarine_ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 - to 3 deadlock . 
184	br-a11	5	5	4221	A two run homer by Norm_Siebern and a solo_blast by Bill_Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . 
185	br-a11	6	6	4254	With one down in the eighth , Marv_Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . 
186	br-a11	6	7	4273	Catcher Frank_House 's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . 
187	br-a11	7	8	4290	Then Heywood_Sullivan , Kansas_City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . 
188	br-a11	8	9	4313	Rookie southpaw George_Stepanovich relieved Hyde at_the_start of the ninth and gave_up the A 's fifth tally on a walk to second_baseman Dick_Howser , a wild_pitch , and Frank_Cipriani 's single under Shortstop Jerry_Adair 's glove into center . 
189	br-a11	9	10	4351	The Orioles once_again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas_City pitchers . 
190	br-a11	9	11	4374	Three were doubles , Brooks_Robinson getting a pair and Marv_Breeding one . 
191	br-a11	10	12	4386	Bill_Kunkel , Bob_Hartman and Ed_Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West_Palm_Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami_Stadium . 
192	br-a11	11	13	4412	The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took_over in the top of the fourth . 
193	br-a11	11	14	4435	Hartman , purchased by the A 's from the Milwaukee_Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance , and merited the triumph . 
194	br-a11	12	15	4463	Keegan , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch 158 - pounder , gave_up the Orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . 
195	br-a11	13	16	4507	In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . 
196	br-a11	14	17	4533	Whitey_Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base_on_balls . 
197	br-a11	15	18	4556	Then three consecutive pinch_hitters failed to produce . 
198	br-a11	16	19	4564	Pete_Ward was sent in_for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short . 
199	br-a11	17	20	4588	John_Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2 - and 2 pitches , and Buddy_Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced_out sharply to Jerry_Lumpe at second to end the 2 - hour and - 27 - minute contest . 
200	br-a11	18	21	4631	The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ_Snyder 's single to right and crossed on Kunkel 's wild_pitch into the dirt in_front of the plate . 
201	br-a11	19	22	4685	The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out . 
202	br-a11	20	23	4704	Jackie_Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally . 
203	br-a11	21	24	4717	Jim_Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel 's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first_baseman Throneberry 's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error . 
204	br-a11	22	25	4758	Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners . 
205	br-a11	22	26	4772	When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut_down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy_Carey . 
206	br-a11	23	27	4797	The detailed rundown on the Kansas_City scoring in the sixth went like this : 
207	br-a11	24	28	4811	Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde 's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center . 
208	br-a11	25	29	4841	Carey singled on a slow bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut_across to field and threw wide to first . 
209	br-a11	25	30	4861	It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit . 
210	br-a11	26	31	4871	Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double_play . 
211	br-a11	26	32	4879	Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting_up Tuttle 's 390 - foot homer over the wall in left center . 
212	br-a11	27	33	4899	If the Orioles are to break their losing_streak within the next two days , it will have to be at_the_expense_of the American_League champion New_York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night_game and a single test Sunday afternoon . 
213	br-a11	28	34	4940	The flavor of Baltimore 's Florida_Grapefruit_League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron_Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army 's military training_program and is ready for belated spring_training . 
214	br-a11	29	35	4975	Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove_in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average , completes the Birds ' spring squad at 49 players . 
215	br-a11	30	36	5006	The big , 22 - year old shortstop , the 1960 American_league `` rookie of the year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $ 15000 and was a spectator at tonight 's 5 - to 3 loss to Kansas_City - the winless Birds ' sixth setback in_a_row . 
216	br-a11	31	37	5064	The 6 - foot 3 inch Hansen checked_in close_to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting_weight last spring . 
217	br-a11	31	38	5085	He hopes to melt_off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks_camp three weeks hence . 
218	br-a11	32	39	5101	When he was inducted into the Army at Fort_Knox_, Ky. , Hansen 's weight had dropped to 180 - `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said . 
219	br-a11	33	40	5134	`` I feel good physically '' , Hansen added , `` but I think I 'll move better carrying a_little less weight than I'm carrying now '' . 
220	br-a11	34	41	5162	The rangy , Albany ( Cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as_well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding '' as his 1961 goal . 
221	br-a11	35	42	5196	`` I think I can do a better job with the glove , now that I know the hitters around the league a_little better '' , he said . 
222	br-a11	36	43	5225	Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami_Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two game weekend series with the New_York Yankees . 
223	br-a11	37	44	5251	Skinny_Brown and Hoyt_Wilhelm , the Flock 's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the American_League champions in tomorrow 's 8 P.M. contest . 
224	br-a11	38	45	5276	Ryne_Duren and Roland_Sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15 - 1 record last year for the Yanks ' Auburn ( N.Y. ) farm_club of the Class - D New_York-Pennsylvania_League , are the probable rival pitchers . 
225	br-a11	39	46	5314	Twenty-one year old Milt_Pappas and Jerry_Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers ' Art_Ditmar in Sunday 's 2 P.M. encounter . 
226	br-a11	40	47	5343	Ralph_Houk , successor to Casey_Stengel at the Yankee helm , plans to bring the entire New_York squad here from St._Petersburg , including Joe_Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games . 
227	br-a11	40	48	5376	The famed Yankee_Clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting_coach . 
228	br-a11	41	49	5390	Pitcher Steve_Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army 's accelerated wintertime military course , also at Fort_Knox , Ky. . 
229	br-a11	41	50	5417	The 22 - year old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen . 
230	br-a11	42	51	5431	Baltimore 's bulky spring_training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul_Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit . 
231	br-a11	43	52	5460	`` Take a ride on this one '' , Brooks_Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third_sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third inning two run double off the left centerfield wall tonight . 
232	br-a11	44	53	5499	It was the first of two doubles by Robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate . 
233	br-a11	45	54	5517	Just before game time , Robinson 's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer . 
234	br-a11	46	55	5543	Unfortunately , Brooks ' teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven hit pitching of three Kansas_City rookie hurlers . 
235	br-a11	47	56	5569	Hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with Lee_MacPhail ; J._A._W._Iglehart , chairman of the Oriole board_of_directors , and Public_Relations_Director Jack_Dunn . 
236	br-a11	48	57	5596	Their flight was delayed , Dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane . 
237	br-a11	49	58	5619	Ex Oriole Clint_Courtney , now catching for the A 's is all for the American_League 's 1961 expansion to the West_Coast . 
238	br-a11	50	59	5641	`` But they shouldda brought_in Tokyo , too '' , added Old_Scrapiron . 
239	br-a11	50	60	5654	`` Then we 'd really have someplace to go '' . 
240	br-a11	51	61	5665	Gaining her second straight victory , Norman_B._Small_,_Jr. 's Garden_Fresh , a 3 - year old filly , downed promising colts in the $ 4500 St._Patrick's_Day_Purse , featured seventh race here today , and paid $ 7.20 straight . 
241	br-a11	52	62	5703	Toying_with her field in the early stages , Garden_Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip_Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3 - 5 for the 7 furlongs . 
242	br-a11	53	63	5742	Richard_M._Forbes 's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in_front of Glen_T._Hallowell 's Milties_Miss . 
243	br-a11	54	64	5781	A bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for_the_first_time this week and 8280 St._Patty_Day celebrants bet $ 842617 on the well prepared program . 
244	br-a11	55	65	5810	Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James_P._Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . 
245	br-a11	56	66	5840	Garden_Fresh , the result of a mating of Better_Self and Rosy_Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St._Patrick's_Day_Purse with some speed in reserve . 
246	br-a11	56	67	5870	She was moving_up to the allowance department after winning a $ 10000 claiming event . 
247	br-a11	57	68	5885	George_Kerr , the swift striding Jamaican , set a meet record in the 600 - yard run in the Knights_of_Columbus track_meet tonight , beating Purdue 's Dave_Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . 
248	br-a11	58	69	5919	Kerr , who set the world_record earlier this month in New_York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped_out Mills 's early pace and beat the young Big_10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . 
249	br-a11	58	70	5952	Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal_Whitfield . 
250	br-a11	59	71	5966	Mills shot out in_front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race . 
251	br-a11	59	72	5981	Then Kerr , a graduate_student from Illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held_off Mills 's challenge on the final turn . 
252	br-a11	59	73	6005	Mills was timed in 1.10.4 . 
253	br-a11	60	74	6011	The crowd at the twenty-first annual K._of_C._Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a_few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one week old world_record in the half-mile run . 
254	br-a11	61	75	6049	Mrs._Grace_Butcher , of nearby Chardon , a 27 - year old housewife who has two children , finished in 2.21.6 . 
255	br-a11	61	76	6070	She snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set by Helen_Shipley , of Wellsley_College , in the National_A.A.U. meet in Columbus , Ohio . 
256	br-a11	62	77	6096	Bobby_Waters of Sylvania , Ga. , relief quarterback for the San_Francisco 49ers of the National_Football_League , will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin_Hospital here . 
257	br-a11	63	78	6122	Waters injured his left knee in the last game of the 1960 season . 
258	br-a11	63	79	6136	While working_out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician . 
259	br-a11	64	80	6156	Two errors by New_York Yankee shortstop Tony_Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned_runs and a 5 - to 2 victory to the Chicago_White_Sox today . 
260	br-a12	1	1	6182	A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team 's plays , Eldon_Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest_Conference scoring after three games . 
261	br-a12	2	2	6206	Time stands_still every time Moritz , a 26 - year old Army_Signal_Corps veteran , goes_into the field . 
262	br-a12	2	3	6224	Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick - several every Saturday , in_fact - out of football . 
263	br-a12	3	4	6252	Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip_pads but he 's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the cotton_bowl . 
264	br-a12	4	5	6287	That 's because he already has kicked 14 extra_points in 15 tries . 
265	br-a12	4	6	6300	He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41 - 8 slaughter of Washington_State . 
266	br-a12	5	7	6328	Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . 
267	br-a12	5	8	6351	But ask coach Darrell_Royal what position he plays and you 'll get the quick response , `` place_kicker '' . 
268	br-a12	6	9	6371	A 208 - pound , 6 - foot 1 - inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking . 
269	br-a12	6	10	6392	Last year , when he worked_out at halfback all season , he did n't get_into a single game . 
270	br-a12	7	11	6411	`` This year , coach Royal told me if I 'd work_on my place-kicking he thought he could use me '' , said Moritz . 
271	br-a12	7	12	6436	`` So I started practicing on it in spring_training . 
272	br-a12	8	13	6446	Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough . 
273	br-a12	9	14	6487	Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field_goals this week . 
274	br-a12	9	15	6509	He kicked several while playing at Stamford_High_School , including one that beat Anson , 3 - 0 , in a 1953 district game . 
275	br-a12	10	16	6533	`` I kicked about 110 extra_points in 135 tries during three years in high_school '' , he said , `` and made 26 in_a_row at one time . 
276	br-a12	10	17	6561	I never did miss one in a playoff_game - I kicked about 20 in the five playoff_games my last two years '' . 
277	br-a12	11	18	6584	Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury . 
278	br-a12	11	19	6602	He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 . 
279	br-a12	11	20	6623	His statistical record that year , when Texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards . 
280	br-a12	12	21	6671	He went_into the Army in March , 1957 , and returned two years later . 
281	br-a12	12	22	6686	But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season . 
282	br-a12	13	23	6699	Place_kicking is largely a matter of timing , Moritz declared . 
283	br-a12	14	24	6710	`` Once you get the feel of it , there 's not much to it . 
284	br-a12	14	25	6726	I 've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel . 
285	br-a12	14	26	6749	Practice helps you to get your timing down . 
286	br-a12	15	27	6758	`` It 's kind_of like golf - if you do n't swing a club very often , your timing gets off '' . 
287	br-a12	16	28	6781	Moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra_points during each practice_session . 
288	br-a12	17	29	6796	`` If you kick too_much , your leg gets kinda dead '' , he explained . 
289	br-a12	18	30	6812	In their first three games , the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per_cent their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries . 
290	br-a12	18	31	6874	Tailback James_Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games . 
291	br-a12	18	32	6909	Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington_State game , for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and_then uncorked a 56 - yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench . 
292	br-a12	18	33	6957	Wingback Jack_Collins injured a knee in the Washington_State game but insists he 'll be ready for Oklahoma . 
293	br-a12	18	34	6975	Last week , when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference 's top four in rushing , he said : `` That won't last long '' . 
294	br-a12	18	35	7005	It did n't ; Monday , he had four Longhorns in the top four . 
295	br-a12	19	36	7020	A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday , but attention quickly turned from Saturday 's victory to next week 's problem : Rice_University . 
296	br-a12	19	37	7047	The Mustangs do n't play this week . 
297	br-a12	20	38	7055	`` We 're just real happy for the players '' , Coach Bill_Meek said of the 9 - 7 victory over the Air_Force_Academy . 
298	br-a12	20	39	7079	`` I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on . 
299	br-a12	20	40	7107	It was the first time we 've been ahead this season ( when John_Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field_goal ) '' . 
300	br-a12	21	41	7132	Assistant coach John_Cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the players . 
301	br-a12	21	42	7156	We needed it and we got it '' . 
302	br-a12	22	43	7165	Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy_Nelson and halfback Billy_Gannon . 
303	br-a12	22	44	7180	Both turned_in top jobs for the second straight game . 
304	br-a12	23	45	7190	`` Nelson played magnificent football '' , Meek praised . 
305	br-a12	23	46	7200	`` He knocked_down the interference and made key stops lots_of times . 
306	br-a12	23	47	7212	And he caused the fumble that set_up our touchdown . 
307	br-a12	23	48	7222	He broke that boy ( Air_Force fullback Nick_Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football '' . 
308	br-a12	24	49	7242	Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons ' aerial thrusts in the late stages . 
309	br-a12	25	50	7257	One was on a fourth down screen_pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon 's territory . 
310	br-a12	26	51	7277	`` As_soon_as it started to form , Gannon spotted it '' , Meek said . 
311	br-a12	26	52	7292	`` He timed it just_right and broke_through there before the boy ( halfback Terry_Isaacson ) had time to turn_around . 
312	br-a12	26	53	7312	He really crucified him . 
313	br-a12	26	54	7317	He nailed it for a yard loss '' . 
314	br-a12	27	55	7326	The Air_Force's , and the game 's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob_McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards . 
315	br-a12	28	56	7356	`` He just lay back there and waited for it '' , Meek said . 
316	br-a12	28	57	7371	`` He almost brought it back all_the_way '' . 
317	br-a12	29	58	7380	Except for sophomore center Mike_Kelsey and fullback Mike_Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice . 
318	br-a12	30	59	7400	`` Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game '' , Meek said . 
319	br-a12	30	60	7414	`` He 'll be out_of_action all this week . 
320	br-a12	30	61	7423	He got hit from the blind side by the split_end coming_back on the second play of the game . 
321	br-a12	30	62	7442	There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee '' . 
322	br-a12	31	63	7453	Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland . 
323	br-a12	32	64	7467	`` He 's looking a_lot better , and he 's able to run '' , Meek explained . 
324	br-a12	32	65	7485	`` We 'll let him do a_lot of running this week , but I do n't know if he 'll be able to play '' . 
325	br-a12	33	66	7511	The game players saw the Air_Force film Monday , ran for 30_minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes . 
326	br-a12	34	67	7536	`` We 'll work hard Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday '' , Meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday . 
327	br-a12	34	68	7561	We 'll work_out about an hour on Saturday , then we 'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week , then taper_off '' . 
328	br-a12	35	69	7585	SMU will play the Owls at Rice_Stadium in Houston in a night_game Saturday , Oct. 21 . 
329	br-a12	36	70	7602	- Held out_of Texas_Tech 's sweat_suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard_Stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders ' 38 - 7 loss to Texas_A+M . 
330	br-a12	36	71	7636	Because of its important game with Arkansas coming_up Saturday , Baylor worked_out in the rain Monday - mud or no mud . 
331	br-a12	36	72	7658	End Gene_Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl 's game with LSU , was back working_out with Rice_Monday , and John_Nichols , sophomore guard , moved_back into action after a week 's idleness with an ankle injury . 
332	br-a12	36	73	7698	The Texas_Aggies got a day_off Monday - a special gift from Coach Jim_Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George_Hargett , shaken_up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity Saturday . 
333	br-a12	36	74	7739	Halfback Bud_Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly mending sprained ankle , joined TCU 's workout Monday . 
334	br-a12	37	75	7760	The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American_Football_League starts - a 19 - 12 triumph over the Denver_Broncos - but their visit will be a short one . 
335	br-a12	38	76	7794	The Texans have two more road_games - at Buffalo and Houston - before they play for the home_folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank_Stram 's men will meet the Bills just_as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings . 
336	br-a12	39	77	7845	Buffalo coach Buster_Ramsey , who has become one of the game 's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex National_Football_Leaguers , M._C._Reynolds and Warren_Rabb . 
337	br-a12	40	78	7878	Rabb , the former Louisiana_State field_general , came_off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22 - 12 upset victory over the Houston_Oilers , defending league champions . 
338	br-a12	41	79	7915	`` Just our luck '' ! exclaimed Stram . 
339	br-a12	41	80	7924	`` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just_as we head that way '' . 
340	br-a12	42	81	7938	Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned_in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack_Spikes , though he did the team 's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury . 
341	br-a12	43	82	7994	`` Our interior line and our linebackers played exceptionally well '' , said Stram_Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game . 
342	br-a12	43	83	8019	`` In_fact our whole defensive unit did a good job '' . 
343	br-a12	44	84	8031	The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton_Davidson throwing only 17 passes . 
344	br-a12	45	85	8048	`` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained Stram . 
345	br-a12	45	86	8075	`` They can be going_along , doing little damage , then bang , bang - they can hit a_couple_of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in_trouble '' . 
346	br-a12	46	87	8105	The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final_period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off . 
347	br-a12	47	88	8131	The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner_Haynes , the flashy halfback . 
348	br-a12	47	89	8148	He was called_upon 26 times - more than all_of the other ball carriers combined - and delivered 145 yards . 
349	br-a12	48	90	8168	The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver 's Al_Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave_Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al_Reynolds claimed it for Dallas . 
350	br-a12	48	91	8206	A quick touchdown resulted . 
351	br-a12	49	92	8211	`` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right_away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I 'll put that play in the book '' . 
352	br-a12	50	93	8241	The early Southwest_Conference football leaders - Texas , Arkansas and Texas_A+M - made a big dent in the statistics last week . 
353	br-a12	51	94	8263	Texas ' 545 - yard spree against Washington_State gave the Longhorns a 3 - game total offense of 1512 yards ( 1065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high . 
354	br-a12	52	95	8295	Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A+M , with a 38 - point bulge against Texas_Tech ran_up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . 
355	br-a12	52	96	8340	Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards . 
356	br-a12	53	97	8359	Texas leads in per game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor 's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas ' 189 ) . 
357	br-a12	53	98	8399	A+M has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game . 
358	br-a12	54	99	8412	Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in_use , the major_leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in_progress at Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology . 
359	br-a13	1	1	8440	Rookie Ron_Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made_it two straight over Indianapolis , 5 - 3 . 
360	br-a13	2	2	8461	The husky 6 - 3 , 205 - pound lefthander , was in command all_the_way before an on_the_scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . 
361	br-a13	3	3	8493	It was Nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight . 
362	br-a13	3	4	8515	They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American_Association pack . 
363	br-a13	4	5	8530	Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley_Hinton in the third inning . 
364	br-a13	4	6	8542	He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . 
365	br-a13	5	7	8561	The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday 's opener , and never lagged . 
366	br-a13	6	8	8583	Dick_McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don_Rudolph to open the Bear 's attack . 
367	br-a13	6	9	8601	After Al_Paschal grounded_out , Jay_Cooke walked and Jim_McDaniel singled home McAuliffe . 
368	br-a13	6	10	8613	Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line_drive to left . 
369	br-a13	6	11	8624	Jay_Porter drew a base_on_balls to fill the bases but Don_Wert 's smash was knocked_down by Rudolph for the putout . 
370	br-a13	7	12	8644	The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil_Shartzer 's glove . 
371	br-a13	8	13	8676	Nischwitz was working_on a 3_hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth . 
372	br-a13	8	14	8697	Chuck_Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , Cliff_Cook and Dan_Pavletich singled and Gaines ' infielder roller accounted_for the tallies . 
373	br-a13	9	15	8717	The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik 's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert . 
374	br-a13	10	16	8738	Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth . 
375	br-a13	11	17	8755	Despite the 45 - degree weather the game was clicked_off in 1 : 48 , thanks to only three bases_on_balls and some good infield play . 
376	br-a13	12	18	8781	Chico_Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik 's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came_up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third_base . 
377	br-a13	13	19	8811	Cliff_Cook accounted_for three of the Tribe 's eight hits . 
378	br-a13	13	20	8821	It was the season 's first night_game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in_order . 
379	br-a13	13	21	8838	The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark . 
380	br-a13	13	22	8852	Mary_Dobbs_Tuttle was back at the organ . 
381	br-a13	13	23	8859	Among the spectators was the noted exotic_dancer , Patti_Waggin who is Mrs._Don_Rudolph when off the stage . 
382	br-a13	13	24	8876	Lefty Wyman_Carey , another Denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran John_Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night . 
383	br-a13	13	25	8897	Ed_Donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn . 
384	br-a13	14	26	8912	Kenny_Lane of Muskegon , Mich. , world 's seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip_Randall of Tyler , Tex. , here Monday night . 
385	br-a13	15	27	8943	Billy_Gardner 's line_double , which just eluded the diving Minnie_Minoso in left_field , drove_in Jim_Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota_Twins a 6 - 5 victory over the Chicago_White_Sox Monday . 
386	br-a13	16	28	8985	Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center . 
387	br-a13	16	29	9001	He came all_the_way around on Gardner 's hit before 5777 fans . 
388	br-a13	16	30	9013	It was Gardner 's second run_batted_in of the game and his only ones of the year . 
389	br-a13	17	31	9030	Turk_Lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while Ray_Moore won his second game against a single loss . 
390	br-a13	18	32	9054	The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno_Bertoia beat_out a high chopper to third_base and scored on Lenny_Green 's double to left . 
391	br-a13	19	33	9080	The White_Sox had taken a 5 - 4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop_fly hits - a triple by Roy_Sievers and single by Camilo_Carreon - a walk and a sacrifice_fly . 
392	br-a13	20	34	9117	Jim_Landis ' 380 - foot home_run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1 - 0 lead , but Harmon_Killebrew came_back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob_Allison aboard . 
393	br-a13	21	35	9160	Al_Smith 's 340 - blast over left in the fourth - his fourth homer of the campaign - tied the score and Carreon 's first major_league home_run in the fifth put the Sox back in_front . 
394	br-a13	22	36	9196	A double by Green , Allison 's run scoring 2_baser , an infield single by Lemon and Gardner 's solid single to center put the Twins back in_front in the last of the fifth . 
395	br-a13	23	37	9231	Boston_Red_Sox Outfielder Jackie_Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball . 
396	br-a13	24	38	9243	`` I 've had it '' , he told a newsman . 
397	br-a13	24	39	9255	`` I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going_to be any 25th man on the ball_club '' . 
398	br-a13	25	40	9276	This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout . 
399	br-a13	26	41	9288	Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a .130 batting average in the first 12 games . 
400	br-a13	27	42	9307	He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across_the_nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe_Ann_Olsen , awaited . 
401	br-a13	28	43	9352	She said , when she learned Jackie was heading_home : 
402	br-a13	28	44	9362	`` I'm just speculating , but I have_to think Jack feels he 's hurting Boston 's chances '' . 
403	br-a13	29	45	9381	The Union_Pacific_Railroad streamliner , City_of_San_Francisco , stopped in Ogden , Utah , for a_few minutes . 
404	br-a13	29	46	9397	Sports_Writer Ensign_Ritchie of the Ogden_Standard_Examiner went_to his compartment to talk with him . 
405	br-a13	30	47	9410	The conductor said to Ritchie : `` I do n't think you want to talk to him . 
406	br-a13	30	48	9428	You 'll probably get a ball bat on the head . 
407	br-a13	30	49	9439	He 's mad at the world '' . 
408	br-a13	31	50	9447	But Jackie had gone_into the station . 
409	br-a13	31	51	9454	Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand . 
410	br-a13	32	52	9464	`` I told him who I was and he was quite cold . 
411	br-a13	32	53	9477	But he warmed_up after a while . 
412	br-a13	32	54	9484	I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( Liston ) got was through a keyhole . 
413	br-a13	32	55	9511	He said he had never talked to Liston '' . 
414	br-a13	33	56	9521	Liston is Bill_Liston , baseball writer for the Boston_Traveler , who quoted Jensen as saying : 
415	br-a13	34	57	9537	`` I can't hit anymore . 
416	br-a13	34	58	9543	I can't run . 
417	br-a13	34	59	9547	I can't throw . 
418	br-a13	34	60	9551	Suddenly my reflexes are gone . 
419	br-a13	35	61	9557	Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . 
420	br-a13	36	62	9581	And so it was over the weekend what with 40 - year old Warren_Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants ' Willie_Mays retaliating with a record tying 4 - homer spree Sunday . 
421	br-a13	37	63	9618	Both , of_course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . 
422	br-a13	38	64	9638	Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn 's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . 
423	br-a13	39	65	9655	It was a real stimulant to a_lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2 - score year milestone . 
424	br-a13	39	66	9677	And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` Wish I was 40 , and a top grade big_leaguer . 
425	br-a13	40	67	9699	THE MODEST AND HAPPY Spahn waved_off his new laurels as one of those good days . 
426	br-a13	40	68	9715	But there surely can be no_doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all_time great lefthanders in the game 's history . 
427	br-a13	41	69	9737	Yes , with Bob_Grove , Carl_Hubbell , Herb_Pennock , Art_Nehf , Vernon_Gomez , et_al . 
428	br-a13	42	70	9752	Spahn not_only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball_player 's ball_player , as they say in the trade . 
429	br-a13	43	71	9776	I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition_game at Bears_Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18792 . 
430	br-a13	44	72	9803	`` Spahnie does n't know how to merely go_through_the_motions '' , remarked Enos_Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse . 
431	br-a13	45	73	9833	The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big_leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home_runs in a span of nine innings . 
432	br-a13	46	74	9863	Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience . 
433	br-a13	46	75	9874	Bobby_Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil_Hodges turned_the_trick in Brooklyn 's Ebbetts_Field . 
434	br-a13	47	76	9893	Ed_Delahanty and Chuck_Klein of the Phillies , the Braves ' Joe_Adcock , Lou_Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat_Seerey of the White_Sox and Rocky_Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on_the_road . 
435	br-a13	48	77	9926	Willie 's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey_Mantle . 
436	br-a13	49	78	9943	This is an issue which boils_down to a matter of opinion , depending_on whether you 're an American or National fan and anti or pro Yankee . 
437	br-a13	49	79	9970	The record_books , however , would favor the Giants ' ace . 
438	br-a13	50	80	9982	In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as_many_as 25 home_runs and stole as_many_as 25 bases . 
439	br-a13	50	81	10000	Once the figure was 30 - 30 . 
440	br-a13	50	82	10008	Willie 's lifetime batting average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's . 
441	br-a13	51	83	10021	The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick_Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee 's park . 
442	br-a13	51	84	10043	It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . 
443	br-a13	52	85	10062	THE DENVER-AREA TV_audience was privileged to see Mays ' four home_runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob_Howsam that the games are not to be blacked_out when his Bears are playing at_home . 
444	br-a13	53	86	10097	This rule providing_for a blackout of televised baseball 30_minutes before the start of a major or minor_league game in any area comes from the game 's top rulers . 
445	br-a13	54	87	10126	The last couple of years the Bears management got_the_business from the `` Living_Room_Athletic_Club '' when games were cut_off . 
446	br-a13	54	88	10145	Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy . 
447	br-a13	55	89	10157	This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide_by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here . 
448	br-a13	55	90	10182	There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise . 
449	br-a13	56	91	10194	It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor_league level . 
450	br-a13	56	92	10213	You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears_Stadium last year because of the television policy . 
451	br-a13	57	93	10233	This dissatisfaction led to Howsam 's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . 
452	br-a13	58	94	10253	The powerful New_York Yankees won their 19th world_series in a 5 - game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13 - 5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale . 
453	br-a13	59	95	10288	With Mickey_Mantle and Yogi_Berra both out_of_action due_to injuries , the American_League champs still mounted a 15 - hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game . 
454	br-a13	60	96	10327	Johnny_Blanchard , Mantle 's replacement , slammed a 2 - run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey_Jay in a 5 - run first inning . 
455	br-a13	60	97	10353	Hector_Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3 - run homer off Bill_Henry during another 5 - run explosion in the fourth . 
456	br-a13	61	98	10377	The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors . 
457	br-a13	62	99	10387	The crowd of 32589 had only two chances to applaud . 
458	br-a13	63	100	10398	In the third Frank_Robinson hammered a long home_run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on . 
459	br-a13	63	101	10427	Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball_game , trailing only 6 - 3 , but the drive fizzled when John_Edwards fouled_out with men on second and third and two out . 
460	br-a13	64	102	10459	In the fifth , Wally_Post slashed a 2 - run homer off Bud_Daley , but by that time the score was 11 - 5 and it really did n't matter . 
461	br-a13	65	103	10490	The Yankee triumph made Ralph_Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World_Series victory in his first year as a manager . 
462	br-a13	65	104	10519	Only Bucky_Harris , the `` boy manager '' of Washington in 1924 , and Eddie_Dyer of the St._Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat . 
463	br-a14	1	1	10545	Nick_Skorich , the line_coach for the football champion Philadelphia_Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . 
464	br-a14	2	2	10562	Skorich received a three year contract at a salary believed to be between $ 20000 and $ 25000 a year . 
465	br-a14	2	3	10583	He succeeds Buck_Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . 
466	br-a14	3	4	10596	The appointment was announced at a news_conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw 's staff - Jerry_Williams and Charlie_Gauer . 
467	br-a14	4	5	10621	Williams is a defensive coach . 
468	br-a14	4	6	10627	Gauer works with the ends . 
469	br-a14	5	7	10633	The selection had been expected . 
470	br-a14	5	8	10639	Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm_Van_Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching_job with the Minnesota_Vikings , the newest National_Football_League entry . 
471	br-a14	6	9	10665	Van_Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . 
472	br-a14	6	10	10685	Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player . 
473	br-a14	7	11	10709	With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing . 
474	br-a14	7	12	10730	In the past the club depended largely on Van_Brocklin 's aerials . 
475	br-a14	8	13	10742	Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack - split between running and passing . 
476	br-a14	9	14	10761	Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati_University and_then had a three year professional career as a lineman under Jock_Sutherland with the Pittsburgh_Steelers . 
477	br-a14	10	15	10789	An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season . 
478	br-a14	10	16	10800	He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh_Central_Catholic_High_School in 1949 . 
479	br-a14	10	17	10810	He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute in Troy , N._Y. . 
480	br-a14	10	18	10825	He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach . 
481	br-a14	11	19	10839	Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green_Bay_Packers . 
482	br-a14	11	20	10853	The Eagles signed him for Shaw 's staff in 1959 . 
483	br-a14	12	21	10864	Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . 
484	br-a14	12	22	10872	At a ceremony in the reception_room of Mayor_Richardson_Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . 
485	br-a14	13	23	10890	Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . 
486	br-a14	14	24	10924	With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William_A._Bill_Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night 's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New_York Chapter , Baseball_Writers_Association_of_America , at the Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel . 
487	br-a14	15	25	10963	Shea , the chairman of Mayor_Wagner_'s_Baseball_Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren_Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee_Braves ; Frank_Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; Bill_Mazeroski , the World_Series hero of the Pittsburgh_Pirates , and Casey_Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees . 
488	br-a14	16	26	11013	Stengel will receive the Ben_Epstein_Good_Guy_Award . 
489	br-a14	16	27	11019	Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe_Ruth_Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world_series . 
490	br-a14	17	28	11045	Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William_J._Slocum_Memorial_Award . 
491	br-a14	17	29	11061	To Spahn will go the Sid_Mercer_Memorial_Award as the chapter 's player of the year . 
492	br-a14	18	30	11076	A crowd of 1400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . 
493	br-a14	19	31	11108	The 53 - year old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible_for the imminent return of a National_League club to New_York . 
494	br-a14	19	32	11142	Named by Mayor_Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James_A._Farley , Bernard_Gimbel and Clint_Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . 
495	br-a14	20	33	11164	His goal was to obtain a National_League team for this city . 
496	br-a14	20	34	11176	The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New_York with only the Yankees . 
497	br-a14	21	35	11193	Despite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forward . 
498	br-a14	21	36	11203	When he was unable to bring_about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National_League club to move here . 
499	br-a14	22	37	11223	When that failed , he enlisted Branch_Rickey 's aid in the formation of a third major_league , the Continental , with New_York as the key franchise . 
500	br-a14	22	38	11250	The Continental_League never got_off_the_ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand . 
501	br-a14	23	39	11267	The New_York franchise is headed by Mrs._Charles_Shipman_Payson . 
502	br-a14	23	40	11275	A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing_Meadow_Park is in_the_works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner_Ford_C._Frick . 
503	br-a14	23	41	11300	Shea 's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium . 
504	br-a14	24	42	11310	Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands_Point , L._I. . 
505	br-a14	24	43	11325	Bill_Jr. , 20 ; Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round_out the Shea family . 
506	br-a14	25	44	11343	Shea was_born in Manhattan . 
507	br-a14	25	45	11348	He attended New_York_University before switching to Georgetown_University in Washington . 
508	br-a14	25	46	11358	He played basketball there while working toward a law_degree . 
509	br-a14	26	47	11368	Later , Shea owned and operated the Long_Island Indians , a minor_league professional football_team . 
510	br-a14	26	48	11383	He was the lawyer for Ted_Collins ' old Boston_Yankees in the National_Football_League . 
511	br-a14	27	49	11396	All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National_Leaguers yesterday . 
512	br-a14	27	50	11411	On Friday , Roger_Maris , the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American_League 's most-valuable-player award , will meet with Roy_Hamey , the general_manager . 
513	br-a14	27	51	11436	Maris is in_line for a big raise . 
514	br-a14	28	52	11444	Arnold_Palmer and Sam_Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan_Golf_Writers_Association tonight . 
515	br-a14	28	53	11462	The dinner will be held at the Hotel_Pierre . 
516	br-a14	29	54	11471	Palmer , golf 's leading money winner in 1960 , and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada_Cup matches last June in Dublin . 
517	br-a14	29	55	11499	Deane_Beman , the National_Amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including Bob_Gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards . 
518	br-a14	30	56	11524	The writers ' Gold_Tee_Award will go to John_McAuliffe of Plainfield , N._J. , and Palm_Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments . 
519	br-a14	30	57	11549	Horton_Smith of Detroit , a former president of the Professional_Golfers_Association , will receive the Ben_Hogan_Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness . 
520	br-a14	31	58	11572	The principal speaker will be Senator_Stuart_Symington , Democrat of Missouri . 
521	br-a14	32	59	11583	Arnold_Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months . 
522	br-a14	32	60	11597	He won the Masters , the United_States_Open and a record $ 80738 in prize_money . 
523	br-a14	32	61	11612	He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports_Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional_Athlete_of_the_Year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $ 10000 diamond - studded Hickok_Belt . 
524	br-a14	33	62	11652	But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . 
525	br-a14	33	63	11669	A_couple_of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par 5 hole . 
526	br-a14	33	64	11684	It made him human . 
527	br-a14	33	65	11689	And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . 
528	br-a14	33	66	11716	If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . 
529	br-a14	34	67	11738	It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . 
530	br-a14	34	68	11756	He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . 
531	br-a14	34	69	11773	The world 's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los_Angeles_open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . 
532	br-a14	34	70	11804	He boomed a 280 - yard drive . 
533	br-a14	34	71	11812	Then the pixies and the zombies took_over while the banshees wailed in the distance . 
534	br-a14	35	72	11827	On the narrow fairway of a 508 - yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot . 
535	br-a14	35	73	11845	The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice . 
536	br-a14	35	74	11858	He tried again and once_more sliced out_of_bounds . 
537	br-a14	35	75	11866	He hooked the next two out_of_bounds on the opposite side . 
538	br-a14	36	76	11877	`` It is possible that I over corrected '' , he said ruefully . 
539	br-a14	36	77	11891	Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . 
540	br-a14	36	78	11902	So he wound_up with a dozen . 
541	br-a14	37	79	11909	`` It was a nice round figure , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too_much perturbed . 
542	br-a14	38	80	11934	From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben_Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas_open . 
543	br-a14	38	81	11972	The idol of the hackers , of_course , is Ray_Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United_States_Open . 
544	br-a14	38	82	11991	Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie_Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock strewn gully . 
545	br-a14	38	83	12020	Willie 's partner was Long_Jim_Barnes , who tried to keep count . 
546	br-a14	39	84	12032	`` How many is that , Jim '' ? asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project . 
547	br-a14	40	85	12051	`` Thirteen '' , said Long_Jim . 
548	br-a14	41	86	12058	`` Nae , man '' , said Willie , `` ye must be countin ' the echoes '' . 
549	br-a14	41	87	12077	He had a 16 . 
550	br-a14	42	88	12082	Palmer 's dozen were honestly earned . 
551	br-a14	42	89	12089	Nor were there any rules to save him . 
552	br-a14	42	90	12098	If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . 
553	br-a14	42	91	12129	This knowledge has come_in_handy , too . 
554	br-a14	43	92	12136	His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . 
555	br-a14	43	93	12158	The ball floated downstream . 
556	br-a14	43	94	12163	A spectator picked_up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot_potato in a very playable lie . 
557	br-a14	44	95	12187	Arnold sent_for Joe_Dey , the executive_secretary of the golf association . 
558	br-a14	44	96	12198	Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . 
559	br-a14	45	97	12218	`` I knew it all_along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . 
560	br-a14	46	98	12252	For a serious young_man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense_of_humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . 
561	br-a14	46	99	12285	Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . 
562	br-a14	46	100	12293	He 'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he 's right . 
563	br-a14	46	101	12309	That 's how he first won the Masters in 1958 . 
564	br-a14	47	102	12320	It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155 - yarder . 
565	br-a14	47	103	12332	Arnold 's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force . 
566	br-a14	48	104	12366	`` I can remove the ball , can't I '' ? asked Palmer of an official . 
567	br-a14	49	105	12383	`` No '' , said the official . 
568	br-a14	49	106	12391	`` You must play it where it lies '' . 
569	br-a14	50	107	12401	`` You 're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . 
570	br-a14	50	108	12417	`` I 'll do as you say , but I 'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . 
571	br-a14	51	109	12439	He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . 
572	br-a14	51	110	12455	The golfing fathers ruled_in his favor . 
573	br-a14	51	111	12462	So he picked_up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . 
574	br-a14	52	112	12482	Until a_few weeks ago , however , Arnold_Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in_common with the duffers . 
575	br-a14	52	113	12502	But after that 12 at Los_Angeles he became one_of_the_boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . 
576	br-a14	53	114	12522	A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis_Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National_Football_League owners at a meeting at the Hotel_Warwick today . 
577	br-a14	54	115	12556	Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football 's hall_of_fame , players ' benefits and constitutional amendments . 
578	br-a14	55	116	12591	The owners would_like each club in the fourteen team league to play a home and home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . 
579	br-a14	55	117	12624	However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks . 
580	br-a14	56	118	12640	Pete_Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed_out : 
581	br-a14	57	119	12648	`` We 'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' . 
582	br-a14	58	120	12666	Nine of the league 's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early season conflict in dates . 
583	br-a15	1	1	12686	If the Cardinals heed Manager_Gene_Mauch of the Phillies , they won't be misled by the Pirates ' slower start this season . 
584	br-a15	2	2	12708	`` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat '' , Mauch said here the other day . 
585	br-a15	2	3	12725	`` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year . 
586	br-a15	2	4	12737	They have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar_Bend_Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby_Shantz '' . 
587	br-a15	3	5	12764	Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking_even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball 's world champions . 
588	br-a15	3	6	12800	The Pirates have a 9 - 6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7 - 9 . 
589	br-a15	4	7	12818	Solly_Hemus announced a switch in his starting_pitcher , from Bob_Gibson to Ernie_Broglio , for several reasons : 
590	br-a15	4	8	12835	1 . 
591	br-a15	4	9	12837	Broglio 's 4 - 0 won-lost_record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; 2 . 
592	br-a15	4	10	12855	The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; 3 . 
593	br-a15	4	11	12868	The Redbirds ' disheartening 11 - 7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday . 
594	br-a15	5	12	12881	Manager_Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment . 
595	br-a15	5	13	12913	After Thursday 's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry_Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night . 
596	br-a15	6	14	12932	Harvey_Haddix , set_back by the flu this season , will start against his former Cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain Kenny_Boyer in tonight 's game at Busch_Stadium . 
597	br-a15	6	15	12963	Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck . 
598	br-a15	7	16	12971	Haddix has a 13 - 8 record against the Redbirds , despite only a 1 - 3 mark in 1960 . 
599	br-a15	8	17	12992	Pirate_Manager_Danny_Murtaugh said he had n't decided between Mizell and Vern_Law for Wednesday 's game . 
600	br-a15	8	18	13007	Mizell has won both of his starts . 
601	br-a15	9	19	13015	After a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , Hemus said that Bob_Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup . 
602	br-a15	9	20	13036	That means Stan_Musial probably will ride_the_bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five home_run day against the Giants . 
603	br-a15	10	21	13056	`` I have to stay with Nieman for_a_while '' , Hemus said . 
604	br-a15	10	22	13069	`` Bill_White ( sore ankles ) should be ready . 
605	br-a15	10	23	13079	With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh , I may use Don_Taussig in center '' . 
606	br-a15	11	24	13094	`` Lindy_McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good '' , Hemus said . 
607	br-a15	11	25	13112	`` He should be getting_back in_the_groove before_long . 
608	br-a15	11	26	13120	Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' . 
609	br-a15	12	27	13131	The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch_Stadium yesterday . 
610	br-a15	13	28	13154	Until the Bucs ' bats quieted_down a_bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over .300 . 
611	br-a15	13	29	13176	Despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky_Burgess .455 , Gino_Cimoli .389 , Bill_Virdon .340 , Bob_Clemente and Dick_Groat , each .323 , Dick_Stuart .306 , Don_Hoak .280 and Bob_Skinner .267 . 
612	br-a15	14	30	13216	Bill_Mazeroski with .179 and Hal_Smith with .143 were the only Pirates dragging_their_feet . 
613	br-a15	15	31	13229	Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit_out most of the series is Bob_Friend , who was beaten by The_Man twice last season on dramatic home_runs . 
614	br-a15	15	32	13264	Friend is off to a great start with a 4 - 0 record but is n't likely to see action here this week . 
615	br-a15	16	33	13288	`` We 're getting Friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good '' , Murtaugh said . 
616	br-a15	16	34	13310	`` Virdon has been blasting the ball . 
617	br-a15	16	35	13318	No plunkers for him '' . 
618	br-a15	17	36	13324	The Pirates jumped_off to an 11 - 3 start by May 1 last year , when the Redbirds as_well_as the Dodgers held them even over the season . 
619	br-a15	17	37	13352	On last May 1 , the Cardinals stood at 7 - 6 , ending a two season fall-off on that milestone . 
620	br-a15	17	38	13374	In 1958 , the_Birds were 3 - 10 on May 1 . 
621	br-a15	17	39	13386	A year later they were 4 - 13 . 
622	br-a15	18	40	13395	Since 1949 , the St._Louis club has been below .500 on May 1 just four times . 
623	br-a15	18	41	13412	The '49 team was off to a so-so 5 - 5 beginning , then fell as low as 12 - 17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories . 
624	br-a15	19	42	13442	The '52 Cards were 6 - 7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club 's top since 1949 . 
625	br-a15	19	43	13465	Then last season the_Birds tumbled as low as 11 - 18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . 
626	br-a15	20	44	13492	Since 1949 , the only National_League club that got_off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . 
627	br-a15	20	45	13518	Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 - 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 . 
628	br-a15	20	46	13541	The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New_York 's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . 
629	br-a15	21	47	13570	They honored the battling Billikens last night . 
630	br-a15	21	48	13578	Speakers at a Tipoff_Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St._Louis_University players who , in the words of Coach_John_Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' . 
631	br-a15	22	49	13611	The most_valuable_player award was split three ways , among Glen_Mankowski , Gordon_Hartweger and Tom_Kieffer . 
632	br-a15	22	50	13626	In_addition , a special award was given to Bob_(_Bevo_) Nordmann , the 6 - foot - 10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury . 
633	br-a15	23	51	13656	`` You often hear people talk_about team_spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a_little different . 
634	br-a15	23	52	13689	The boys had a tremendous respect for each other 's ability . 
635	br-a15	23	53	13701	They knew what they could do and it was often a_little more than I thought they could do . 
636	br-a15	24	54	13720	`` Several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk . 
637	br-a15	24	55	13746	We 'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , ' Do n't worry , Coach - we 'll get 'em all_right '' ' . 
638	br-a15	25	56	13776	The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob_Broeg , sports_editor of the Post-Dispatch . 
639	br-a15	26	57	13793	Kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as_well as his all-round excellent play . 
640	br-a15	27	58	13820	Mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against Bradley in St._Louis_U. 's nationally televised victory . 
641	br-a15	27	59	13841	Benington said , `` I 've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day '' . 
642	br-a15	28	60	13865	Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills . 
643	br-a15	28	61	13896	After the coach listed all the boy 's faults , Hartweger said , `` Coach before I leave here , you 'll get to like me '' . 
644	br-a15	29	62	13924	Mrs._Benington admired Gordon 's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team . 
645	br-a15	30	63	13946	As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` I want to thank coach 's wife for talking him into letting me play '' . 
646	br-a15	31	64	13973	Bob_Burnes , sports_editor of the Globe-Democrat , presented Bob_Nordmann with his award . 
647	br-a15	31	65	13986	Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so_that he could help the team if his knee healed in_time . 
648	br-a15	31	66	14008	Within a week after the injury , suffered in St._Louis 's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament , Nordmann was sitting on the Bill 's bench doing what he could to help Benington . 
649	br-a15	32	67	14045	On the clock given him was the inscription , `` For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken_Basketball , 1960 - 61 '' . 
650	br-a15	33	68	14066	Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21 - 9 record and finished as runner-up in the National_Invitation_Tournament were : Art_Hambric , Donnell_Reid , Bill_Nordmann , Dave_Harris , Dave_Luechtefeld and George_Latinovich . 
651	br-a15	34	69	14099	`` This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future '' , Benington pointed_out . 
652	br-a15	34	70	14117	`` By winning against Bradley , Kentucky and Notre_Dame on those teams ' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn 's take a super team to do_it '' . 
653	br-a15	35	71	14157	St._Louis_University found a way to win a baseball_game . 
654	br-a15	35	72	14166	Larry_Scherer last night pitched a no-hit_game , said to be the first in Billiken baseball history , as the Blue_and_White beat Southeast_Missouri_State_College , 5 - 1 , at Crystal_City . 
655	br-a15	36	73	14196	The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie . 
656	br-a15	36	74	14214	The tie was against Southeast_Missouri last Friday . 
657	br-a15	37	75	14222	Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , Len_Boehmer also was 4 - for - 5 with two doubles and Dave_Ritchie had a home_run and a triple . 
658	br-a15	38	76	14260	St._Louis_U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington_University at Ligget_Field . 
659	br-a15	39	77	14279	The game opened a busy week for Washington . 
660	br-a15	39	78	14288	The Bears are set to play at Harris_Teachers_College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , Saturday . 
661	br-a15	40	79	14310	If it 's true that contented cows give more milk , why should n't happy ball players produce more base_hits ? 
662	br-a15	41	80	14331	The two top talents of the time , Mickey_Mantle and Willie_Mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so_far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations . 
663	br-a15	42	81	14375	And that 's meant as a boost , not a knock . 
664	br-a15	43	82	14387	Mays and Mantle , both 10 - year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they 've never hit the heights . 
665	br-a15	43	83	14416	Their heights , that_is . 
666	br-a15	44	84	14421	Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown_season , 1959 , when he batted .365 and also led the American_League in home_runs , 52 , and RBIs , 130 . 
667	br-a15	45	85	14454	Like the Yankees ' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by - or for - Willie . 
668	br-a15	45	86	14490	His best years were 1954 when he hit .345 with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home_runs , drove_in 127 and stole 24 bases . 
669	br-a15	46	87	14517	Now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they 're going_to pass those previous peaks . 
670	br-a15	47	88	14545	Yes , we know , they 're professionals , men paid to play , and they should n't care how they 're handled , just as_long_as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each_month . 
671	br-a15	48	89	14584	The truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment . 
672	br-a15	48	90	14598	For_that_matter , Stan_Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put_out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort . 
673	br-a15	49	91	14627	Mantle , it 's apparent , resented Casey_Stengel 's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility . 
674	br-a15	49	92	14654	The old_man was almost too possessive . 
675	br-a15	49	93	14661	Stengel inherited DiMaggio , Rizzuto , but he brought_up Mantle from Class C to the majors , from Joplin to New_York . 
676	br-a15	50	94	14683	With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , Ol_'_Case wanted No. 7 to be not_only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder . 
677	br-a15	50	95	14719	Stengel probably preached too_much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble_gum and sow_his_oats . 
678	br-a15	51	96	14738	Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph_Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey . 
679	br-a15	51	97	14770	The Major decided that , rather_than be led , the slugger could lead . 
680	br-a15	51	98	14784	And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so_far . 
681	br-a15	52	99	14794	The opinion continues here that with a 162 - game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10 - team league and a most inviting target in Los_Angeles ' Wrigley_Field_Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe_Ruth 's 60 homers of 1927 . 
682	br-a15	53	100	14844	Mays ' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . 
683	br-a15	53	101	14862	Willie 's wonderful walloping Sunday - four home_runs - served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin_Dark . 
684	br-a15	54	102	14885	Next to Leo_Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass green rookie rushed up_to the Polo_Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant . 
685	br-b13	1	1	14920	Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet . 
686	br-b13	1	2	14934	That is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes . 
687	br-b13	2	3	14950	There are many soft and light shoe_leathers available . 
688	br-b13	2	4	14959	Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers . 
689	br-b13	2	5	14972	Softness is found in crushed textures . 
690	br-b13	3	6	14979	Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape . 
691	br-b13	3	7	14997	Heels place emphasis on the long_legged silhouette . 
692	br-b13	3	8	15005	Wine_glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights . 
693	br-b13	3	9	15017	Stacked_heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes . 
694	br-b13	3	10	15027	Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps . 
695	br-b13	4	11	15040	While white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color . 
696	br-b13	5	12	15066	In the tintable group are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung like textures . 
697	br-b13	6	13	15086	Do n't overlook the straws this year . 
698	br-b13	6	14	15094	They come in crisp basket_weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacy open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors . 
699	br-b13	6	15	15126	In the casual field straws feature wedge_heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles . 
700	br-b13	6	16	15144	For added comfort some of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning . 
701	br-b13	7	17	15158	The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot . 
702	br-b13	7	18	15171	Orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac . 
703	br-b13	7	19	15186	In a brighter nautical vein is Ile_de_France blue . 
704	br-b13	7	20	15195	Contrast trim provides other touches of color . 
705	br-b13	7	21	15203	Spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black , navy and taffy tan . 
706	br-b13	8	22	15221	Designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated . 
707	br-b13	8	23	15230	At the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light , but crisp texture . 
708	br-b13	8	24	15248	In a lacy open weave shoes have a luster finish , braided collar and bow highlight on the squared throat . 
709	br-b13	8	25	15269	At right is a casual style in a crushed unlined white leather . 
710	br-b13	8	26	15282	Flats have a scalloped throat . 
711	br-b13	9	27	15288	An electric_toothbrush ( Broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric_razor in the American bathroom . 
712	br-b13	9	28	15307	The brush moves up_and_down and is small enough to clean every dental surface , including the back of the teeth . 
713	br-b13	9	29	15328	In_addition , the motor has the seal_of_approval of the Underwriters_Laboratories , which means it is safe . 
714	br-b13	10	30	15345	The unit consists_of a small motor that goes_on as_soon_as it is plugged_in . 
715	br-b13	10	31	15358	The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index_finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor . 
716	br-b13	10	32	15382	The brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so_that every member of the family can have his own . 
717	br-b13	11	33	15405	Most_of us brush our teeth by_hand . 
718	br-b13	11	34	15412	The same can be said of shaving yet the electric_razor has proved useful to many men . 
719	br-b13	12	35	15429	The electric_toothbrush moves in a vertical direction , the way dentists recommend . 
720	br-b13	12	36	15442	In_addition , it is small enough to get_into crevices , jacket and crown margins , malposed anteriors , and the back_teeth . 
721	br-b13	12	37	15464	The bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel . 
722	br-b13	13	38	15479	It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing , especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly . 
723	br-b13	13	39	15504	Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device . 
724	br-b13	13	40	15518	The results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly . 
725	br-b13	13	41	15544	The electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicapped by disorders such_as cerebral_palsy or muscular_dystrophy . 
726	br-b13	14	42	15579	But for many_of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury . 
727	br-b13	14	43	15591	It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy of the bristles . 
728	br-b13	14	44	15611	Since the apparatus is new , it requires experimentation and changes in technique . 
729	br-b13	15	45	15625	writes : Does numbness in the left_hand at night , which awakens the person , indicate brain_tumor ? 
730	br-b13	16	46	15643	No . 
731	br-b13	16	47	15645	This is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand . 
732	br-b13	16	48	15665	The pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand . 
733	br-b13	17	49	15684	writes : Do steam_baths have any health value ? 
734	br-b13	18	50	15693	No , other_than cleaning_out the pores and making the sweat_glands work harder . 
735	br-b13	18	51	15706	An ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same . 
736	br-b13	19	52	15717	writes : What makes my hands numb when sewing ? 
737	br-b13	20	53	15727	There are many possibilities , including poor circulation , a variety of neurological conditions , and functional disorders . 
738	br-b13	20	54	15746	This manifestation may be an early sign of multiple_sclerosis or the beginning of sewer 's cramp . 
739	br-b13	21	55	15763	writes : Does a brace help in sciatica ? 
740	br-b13	22	56	15772	A back_brace might help , depending_upon the cause of sciatica . 
741	br-b13	23	57	15783	writes : Does the cholesterol go_down when most of the thyroid_gland is removed ? 
742	br-b13	24	58	15797	No . 
743	br-b13	24	59	15799	It usually goes_up . 
744	br-b13	24	60	15803	The cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body . 
745	br-b13	24	61	15818	It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish . 
746	br-b13	24	62	15834	The latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed . 
747	br-b13	25	63	15846	The gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller with each new recording catalogue . 
748	br-b13	26	64	15863	There 's more reading and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before , although the spoken rather_than the sung word is as old as Thomas_Alva_Edison 's first experiment in recorded sound . 
749	br-b13	26	65	15897	Edison could hardly have guessed , however , that Sophocles would one day appear in stereo . 
750	br-b13	27	66	15914	If the record buyer 's tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit esoteric , he will find them satisfied on educational records . 
751	br-b13	27	67	15939	And he will avoid eye-strain in the process . 
752	br-b13	28	68	15948	Everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party_games has been adapted to the turntable . 
753	br-b13	29	69	15968	For sheer ambition , take the Decca series titled modestly `` Wisdom '' . 
754	br-b13	29	70	15982	Volumes One and Two , selected from the sound_tracks of a television series , contain `` conversations with the elder wise_men of our day '' . 
755	br-b13	30	71	16008	These sages include poet Carl_Sandburg , statesman Jawaharlal_Nehru and sculptor Jacques_Lipchitz , in Volume One , and playwright Sean_O'Casey , David_Ben-Gurion , philosopher Bertrand_Russell and the late Frank_Lloyd_Wright in the second set . 
756	br-b13	30	72	16041	Hugh_Downs is heard interviewing Wright , for an added prestige fillip . 
757	br-b13	31	73	16053	There 's more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by Dover_Publications . 
758	br-b13	31	74	16069	Dover `` publishes '' what the company calls `` Listen_and_Learn '' productions designed to teach foreign languages . 
759	br-b13	31	75	16087	Previous presentations have been on French , Spanish , Russian , Italian , German and Japanese . 
760	br-b13	32	76	16104	But the firm has recognized the tight dollar and the tourist 's desire to visit the `` smaller , less traveled and relatively inexpensive countries '' , and is now prepared to teach modern_Greek and Portuguese through recordings . 
761	br-b13	32	77	16143	The respective vocabularies `` essential for travel '' are available in separate albums . 
762	br-b13	33	78	16157	Thanks to Spoken_Arts_Records , history buffs may hear Lincoln 's `` most memorable speeches and letters '' in a two disc set , interpreted by Lincoln authority and lecturer Roy_P._Basler . 
763	br-b13	33	79	16188	As a contemporary bonus , the set includes Carl_Sandburg 's address at a joint session of Congress , delivered on Lincoln 's birthday two years ago . 
764	br-b13	34	80	16215	For those who `` like poetry but never get_around_to reading it '' , the Library_of_Congress makes it possible for poets to be heard reading their own work . 
765	br-b13	34	81	16243	The program was instituted in 1940 , and releases are available only from the Recording_Laboratory of the Library_of_Congress , Washington 25 , D._C. A catalogue is available on_request . 
766	br-b13	35	82	16272	Newest on the list are John_Ciardi , W._D._Snodgrass , I._A._Richards , Oscar_Williams , Robert_Hillyer , John_Hall_Wheelock , Stephen_Vincent_Benet , Edwin_Muir , John_Peal_Bishop and Maxwell_Bodenheim . 
767	br-b13	35	83	16297	Two poets are paired on each record , in the order given above . 
768	br-b13	36	84	16311	Decca is not the only large commercial company to impart instruction . 
769	br-b13	36	85	16323	RCA_Victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called `` Adventures in Music '' , which is an instructional record library for elementary_schools . 
770	br-b13	36	86	16350	Howard_Mitchell and the National_Symphony perform in the first two releases , designed for grades one and two . 
771	br-b13	36	87	16368	Teaching guides are included with each record . 
772	br-b13	37	88	16376	In an effort to fortify himself against the unforeseen upsets sure to arise in the future , Herbert_A._Leggett , banker editor of the Phoenix `` Arizona_Progress '' , reflects upon a_few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties . 
773	br-b13	38	89	16416	One of the roughest was the TV quiz shows , which gave him inferiority_complexes . 
774	br-b13	38	90	16431	Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned_out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many_another intelligent , well-informed American . 
775	br-b13	39	91	16468	But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $ 2000000 profit on the stock_market . 
776	br-b13	39	92	16499	Every man who dabbles_in the market to make a_little easy_money on_the_side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb . 
777	br-b13	39	93	16532	Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best_seller book to make some dough . 
778	br-b13	40	94	16559	People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's-eye achievements . 
779	br-b13	40	95	16586	The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it . 
780	br-b13	40	96	16607	His answer was simple but honest . 
781	br-b13	40	97	16614	He just shot at the board and_then drew circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye . 
782	br-b13	41	98	16631	One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2 - year old child is a lack of verbal communication . 
783	br-b13	41	99	16653	The child understands no . 
784	br-b13	41	100	16658	He senses his mother 's disapproval . 
785	br-b13	41	101	16665	But explanations leave him confused and unmoved . 
786	br-b13	42	102	16673	If his mother loves him , he clings_to that love as a ballast . 
787	br-b13	42	103	16687	It motivates his behavior . 
788	br-b13	42	104	16692	He wants Mommy to think him a good boy . 
789	br-b13	42	105	16702	He does n't want her to look frowningly at him , or speak_to him angrily . 
790	br-b13	42	106	16718	This breaks_his_heart . 
791	br-b13	42	107	16721	He wants to be called sweet , good , considerate and mother 's little helper . 
792	br-b13	42	108	16737	But even mother 's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior . 
793	br-b13	43	109	16749	His desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother 's love for him and what she expects of him , in_order to overcome them . 
794	br-b13	43	110	16778	His own inner voice , which should tell him what not to do , has not developed . 
795	br-b13	43	111	16796	It won't develop until he has words with which to clothe it . 
796	br-b13	43	112	16809	The conscience is non-existent in the 2 - year old . 
797	br-b13	44	113	16820	What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? 
798	br-b13	44	114	16830	She can decrease the number of temptations . 
799	br-b13	44	115	16838	She can remove all knick-knacks within reach . 
800	br-b13	44	116	16846	The fewer nos she has_to utter the more effective they will be . 
801	br-b13	45	117	16859	She should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child . 
802	br-b13	45	118	16874	If he can't play with Mommy 's magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own . 
803	br-b13	45	119	16893	If Daddy 's books are out_of_bounds his own picture_books are not . 
804	br-b13	45	120	16905	Toys he has can be made to act_as substitutes for family temptations such_as refrigerator and gas_stove . 
805	br-b13	46	121	16922	During this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child 's conscience . 
806	br-b13	46	122	16942	She tells him of the consequences of his behavior . 
807	br-b13	46	123	16952	If he bites a playmate she says , `` Danny won't like you '' . 
808	br-b13	46	124	16967	If he snatches a toy , she says , `` Caroline wants her own truck just as you do '' . 
809	br-b13	47	125	16988	There is no use trying to `` Explain '' to a 2 - year old . 
810	br-b13	47	126	17004	Actions speak louder . 
811	br-b13	47	127	17008	Remove temptations . 
812	br-b13	47	128	17011	Remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior . 
813	br-b13	47	129	17021	Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act . 
814	br-b13	47	130	17037	He won't submit to his natural desires all_the_time , and it 's Mother 's love that is responsible_for his good behavior . 
815	br-b20	1	1	17059	The nuclear war is already being fought , except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets - not_yet . 
816	br-b20	1	2	17081	It is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think_factories . 
817	br-b20	1	3	17102	They predicted escalation , and escalation is what we are getting . 
818	br-b20	1	4	17114	The biggest nuclear device the United_States has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our B-52s are said to be carrying two 20 - megaton_bombs apiece . 
819	br-b20	1	5	17141	Some time ago , however , Mr._Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the Soviet_Union would make them . 
820	br-b20	1	6	17162	He seems to have at_least a_few 30 - and 50 - megaton_bombs on_hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock . 
821	br-b20	1	7	17188	And now , of_course , the hue_and_cry for counter escalation is being raised on our side . 
822	br-b20	1	8	17205	Khrushchev threatens us with a 100 - megaton_bomb ? 
823	br-b20	1	9	17214	So_be_it - then we must embark_on a crash program for 200 - megaton_bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron_bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing . 
824	br-b20	1	10	17250	So escalation proceeds , ad_infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead_of on their respective proving_grounds . 
825	br-b20	2	11	17275	What is needed , Philip_Morrison writes in The_Cornell_Daily_Sun ( October 26 ) is a discontinuity . 
826	br-b20	2	12	17291	The escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon . 
827	br-b20	2	13	17302	`` Only a discontinuity can end it '' , Professor_Morrison writes . 
828	br-b20	2	14	17314	`` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . 
829	br-b20	3	15	17333	Morrison points_out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet_Union or Red_China , it is the most vulnerable of the great_powers - Europe of_course must be written_off out_of_hand . 
830	br-b20	3	16	17364	He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United_States is the least risky path our government can take . 
831	br-b20	3	17	17391	His proposal is opposed to that of Richard_Nixon , Governor_Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic_Energy_Commission , Dr._Edward_Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold_war . 
832	br-b20	3	18	17428	These gentlemen are calling_for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in_the_name_of national security . 
833	br-b20	3	19	17452	Escalation is their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death . 
834	br-b20	4	20	17468	Capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation 's security are incapable of learning , or even of observing . 
835	br-b20	4	21	17495	If this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation . 
836	br-b20	4	22	17515	He has gained only one thing - he has exploded a 50 - megaton_bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges . 
837	br-b20	4	23	17546	But if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously . 
838	br-b20	4	24	17564	Not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere . 
839	br-b20	5	25	17581	Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent_on following compulsively in his footsteps . 
840	br-b20	5	26	17610	When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural . 
841	br-b20	5	27	17627	Thus , when the Russians sent up their first sputnik , American chagrin was human enough , and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable . 
842	br-b20	5	28	17657	But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly . 
843	br-b20	6	29	17680	When East_Germans fled to the West by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists . 
844	br-b20	6	30	17701	They are less vocal now , when it is the West_Berliners who are migrating . 
845	br-b20	6	31	17716	The flood is not as great - only 700 a week according_to one apparently conservative account - but it is symptomatic . 
846	br-b20	6	32	17738	West_Berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable . 
847	br-b20	6	33	17753	Nearly 18 per_cent of West_Berlin 's 2200000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12.8 per_cent are under fifteen . 
848	br-b20	7	34	17773	R._H._S._Crossman , M.P. , writing in The_Manchester_Guardian , states that departures from West_Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a week . 
849	br-b20	7	35	17813	The official statistics show that 60 per_cent are employed workers or independent professional people . 
850	br-b20	7	36	17828	Whole families are moving and removal_firms are booked for months ahead . 
851	br-b20	7	37	17840	The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each_week from West_Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that `` The closing_off of East_Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East_German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West_Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow . 
852	br-b20	7	38	17905	The gallant half city is dying on_its_feet '' . 
853	br-b20	8	39	17914	Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in the Observer ( London ) . 
854	br-b20	8	40	17931	Mark_Arnold-Foster writes : `` People are leaving [ West_Berlin ] because they think it is dying . 
855	br-b20	8	41	17948	They are leaving so fast that the president of the West_German_Employers'_Federation issued an appeal this week to factory_workers in the West to volunteer for six months ' front-line work in factories in West_Berlin . 
856	br-b20	8	42	17982	Berlin 's resilience is amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the West the struggle will be hard indeed '' . 
857	br-b20	9	43	18007	The handwriting is on_the_wall . 
858	br-b20	9	44	18012	The only hope for West_Berlin lies_in a compromise which will bring_down the wall and reunite the city . 
859	br-b20	9	45	18030	State_Department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into East_Berlin under military escort , will not avail . 
860	br-b20	9	46	18055	Tanks lined_up at the border will be no_more helpful . 
861	br-b20	9	47	18065	The materials for compromise are at_hand : The Nation , Walter_Lippmann and other sober commentators ( see Alan_Clark on p. 367 ) have spelled them out again_and_again . 
862	br-b20	9	48	18093	A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save Berlin . 
863	br-b20	9	49	18111	Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence , if that is what the West wants . 
864	br-b20	10	50	18131	The removal of Stalin 's body from the mausoleum he shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history . 
865	br-b20	10	51	18158	It is , in_fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead . 
866	br-b20	10	52	18171	A British writer , Richard_Haestier , in a book , Dead_Men_Tell_Tales , recalls that in the turmoil preceding French_Revolution the body of Henry_/4 , , who had died nearly 180 years earlier , was torn to pieces by a mob . 
867	br-b20	10	53	18212	And in England , after the Restoration , the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn . 
868	br-b20	10	54	18231	The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows . 
869	br-b20	11	55	18254	Contemplating these posthumous punishments , Stalin should not lose all hope . 
870	br-b20	11	56	18266	In 1899 , Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster , facing Whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands . 
871	br-b20	11	57	18289	Nikita_Khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself . 
872	br-b20	11	58	18301	The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , Moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of communism deplores waste . 
873	br-b20	11	59	18325	Who will take Stalin 's place beside Lenin ? 
874	br-b20	11	60	18334	There is Karl_Marx , of_course , buried in London . 
875	br-b20	11	61	18344	The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable . 
876	br-b20	11	62	18374	Who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin ? 
877	br-b20	11	63	18387	Who but Nikita himself ? 
878	br-b20	11	64	18392	Since he has just shown who is top_dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the Soviet people . 
879	br-b20	11	65	18419	Besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life . 
880	br-b20	11	66	18446	Suppose he did lie beside Lenin , would it be permanent ? 
881	br-b20	11	67	18458	If some future Khrushchev decided to rake_up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory_workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ? 
882	br-b20	11	68	18484	When a man is laid_to_rest , he is entitled to stay_put . 
883	br-b20	11	69	18496	If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand . 
884	br-b20	12	70	18512	The appointment of U_Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary_General - at this writing , the choice appears to be certain - offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends . 
885	br-b20	12	71	18556	Mongi_Slim of Tunisia and Frederick_Boland of Ireland were early favorites in_the_running , but France did n't like the former and the Soviet_Union would have none of the latter . 
886	br-b20	12	72	18585	With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr._Hammarskjold , U_Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto . 
887	br-b20	12	73	18614	What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy . 
888	br-b20	12	74	18637	In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers_game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat . 
889	br-b20	12	75	18681	He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future . 
890	br-b20	12	76	18695	He is a Buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not_only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung . 
891	br-b20	13	77	18724	U_Thant of_course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when Mr._Hammarskjold 's term would have come to an end . 
892	br-b20	13	78	18747	Whether the compromises - on both sides - that made_possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen . 
893	br-b20	13	79	18769	Mr._Khrushchev 's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U_Thant represents . 
894	br-b20	13	80	18797	In_a_sense , the showdown promised by Mr._Hammarskjold 's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; no precedents have been set as_yet ; structurally , the U.N. is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing_to_bear upon it . 
895	br-b20	13	81	18843	But at_least the pessimists who believed that the world_organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong . 
896	br-b20	14	82	18869	No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade . 
897	br-b20	14	83	18888	These are mentalities which crave action - and they are beginning to get_it , as Messrs._Salsich and Engh report on page 372 . 
898	br-b20	14	84	18911	Even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ? ) 
899	br-b20	14	85	18922	left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading . 
900	br-b20	14	86	18932	Friends , a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary_organization of employees of the Gulf_Telephone_Company at Foley , Alabama . 
901	br-b20	14	87	18955	`` If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf_Coast '' , the account reads , `` they can count_on heavy opposition from a group of commando trained telephone employees - all girls . 
902	br-b20	14	88	18994	Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast moving Civil_Defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move_into action at a minute 's notice '' . 
903	br-b20	14	89	19022	According_to Friends , the unit was organized by John_Snook , a former World_War_/2 , commando who is vice_president and general_manager of the telephone_company . 
904	br-b20	14	90	19046	The girls , very fetching in their uniforms , are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump_truck ; they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies ' accessories . 
905	br-b20	15	91	19087	This may be opera_bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold_war mount in frenzy . 
906	br-b20	15	92	19106	The country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means . 
907	br-b20	15	93	19119	The doctrine has never worked ; it is not working now . 
908	br-b20	15	94	19131	The official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ; it cannot bring them into actual play . 
909	br-b20	15	95	19152	A more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined . 
910	br-b20	15	96	19163	As the civic temper rises , the more naive citizens begin to play soldier - but the guns are real . 
911	br-b20	15	97	19184	Soon they will begin to hunt_down the traitors they are assured are in our midst . 
912	br-c01	1	1	19200	It is not news that Nathan_Milstein is a wizard of the violin . 
913	br-c01	1	2	19213	Certainly not in Orchestra_hall where he has played countless recitals , and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago_Symphony_orchestra , playing the Brahms_Concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed . 
914	br-c01	2	3	19275	There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white_heat . 
915	br-c01	2	4	19291	Not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent . 
916	br-c01	2	5	19312	Those would be reserved for the orchestra 's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself . 
917	br-c01	2	6	19329	This time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood . 
918	br-c01	2	7	19347	But he had in Walter_Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point . 
919	br-c01	3	8	19362	That_is , when Mr._Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , Mr._Hendl could go_along . 
920	br-c01	3	9	19393	But Mr._Hendl does not go straight to any point . 
921	br-c01	3	10	19403	He flounders and lets music sprawl . 
922	br-c01	3	11	19410	There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion . 
923	br-c01	3	12	19438	So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein , but not great Brahms . 
924	br-c01	4	13	19452	The concert opened with another big romantic score , Schumann's Overture_to_Manfred , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat . 
925	br-c01	4	14	19482	Hindemith 's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands translucent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit . 
926	br-c01	4	15	19508	It got the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style . 
927	br-c01	5	16	19535	The Bayreuth_Festival opens July 23 with a new production of `` Tannhaeuser '' staged by Wieland_Wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by Wolfgang_Sawallisch . 
928	br-c01	5	17	19566	Sawalisch also conducts `` The_Flying_Dutch '' , opening July 24 . 
929	br-c01	5	18	19577	`` Parsifal '' follows July 25 , with Hans_Knappertsbusch conducting , and he also conducts `` Die_Meistersinger '' , to be presented Aug. 8 and 12 . 
930	br-c01	5	19	19604	The `` Ring '' cycles are July 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and Aug. 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 . 
931	br-c01	5	20	19629	Rudolf_Kempe conducts . 
932	br-c01	5	21	19632	No casts are listed , but Lotte_Lehmann sent_word that the Negro soprano , Grace_Bumbry , will sing Venus in `` Tannhaeuser '' . 
933	br-c01	6	22	19655	Remember how BY a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi_Ballet ? 
934	br-c01	6	23	19669	Remember how by lack of two big theaters Chicago missed the first visit of the Royal_Danish_Ballet ? 
935	br-c01	6	24	19686	Well , now we have two big theaters . 
936	br-c01	6	25	19695	But barring a miracle , and do n't hold your breath for it , Chicago will not see the Leningrad-Kirov_Ballet , which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world . 
937	br-c01	7	26	19736	Before you let_loose a howl saying we announced its coming , not once but several times , indeed we did . 
938	br-c01	7	27	19757	The engagement was_supposed_to be all set for the big theater in McCormick_Place , which Sol_Hurok , ballet booker extraordinary , considers the finest house of its kind in the country - and of_course he does n't weep at the capacity , either . 
939	br-c01	8	28	19800	It was all set . 
940	br-c01	8	29	19805	Allied_Arts corporation first listed the Chicago dates as Dec. 4 thru 10 . 
941	br-c01	8	30	19818	Later the Hurok office made it Dec. 8 thru 17 , a nice , long booking for the full repertory . 
942	br-c01	8	31	19839	But if you keep a calendar of events , as we do , you noticed a conflict . 
943	br-c01	8	32	19857	Allied_Arts had booked Marlene_Dietrich into McCormick_Place Dec. 8 and 9 . 
944	br-c01	8	33	19868	Something had to give . 
945	br-c01	8	34	19873	Not La_Dietrich . 
946	br-c01	8	35	19876	Allied_Arts then notified us that the Kirov would cut_short its Los_Angeles booking , fly here to open Nov. 28 , and close Dec. 2 . 
947	br-c01	8	36	19901	Shorter booking , but still a booking . 
948	br-c01	8	37	19909	We printed it . 
949	br-c01	9	38	19913	A_couple_of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned Allied_Arts for ticket information and was told `` the newspapers had made a mistake '' . 
950	br-c01	9	39	19939	So I started making some calls of my own . 
951	br-c01	9	40	19949	These are the results . 
952	br-c01	10	41	19954	The Kirov_Ballet is firmly booked into the Shrine_Auditorium , Los_Angeles , Nov. 21 thru Dec. 4 . 
953	br-c01	10	42	19971	Not a chance of opening here Nov. 28 - barring that miracle . 
954	br-c01	10	43	19984	Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held for us ? 
955	br-c01	10	44	19996	Well , Dietrich won't budge from McCormick_Place . 
956	br-c01	10	45	20004	Then how about the Civic_Opera_house ? 
957	br-c01	10	46	20010	Well , Allied_Arts has booked Lena_Horne there for a week starting Dec. 4 . 
958	br-c01	11	47	20024	Queried about the impasse , Allied_Arts said : `` Better cancel the Kirov for_the_time_being . 
959	br-c01	11	48	20039	It 's all up_in_the_air again '' . 
960	br-c01	12	49	20046	So the Kirov will fly back to Russia , minus a Chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fans - and for the frustrated bookers , cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country . 
961	br-c01	13	50	20084	Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium ? 
962	br-c01	14	51	20091	Paintings and drawings by Marie_Moore of St._Thomas , Virgin_Islands , are shown thru Nov. 5 at the Meadows_gallery , 3211 Ellis_Ave. , week_days , 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. , Sundays 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. , closed Mondays . 
963	br-c01	15	52	20131	An exhibition of Evelyn_Cibula 's paintings will open with a reception Nov. 5 at the Evanston_Community_center , 828 Davis_st. . 
964	br-c01	15	53	20151	It will continue all month . 
965	br-c01	16	54	20157	Abstractions and semi abstractions by Everett_McNear are being exhibited by the University_gallery_of_Notre_Dame until Nov. 5 . 
966	br-c01	17	55	20173	In the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget , the Dallas_Civic_Opera will use San_Francisco 's new Leni_Bauer-Ecsy production of `` Lucia_di_Lammermoor '' this season , returning the favor next season when San_Francisco uses the Dallas `` Don_Giovanni '' , designed by Franco_Zeffirelli . 
967	br-c01	18	56	20218	H._E._Bates has scribbled a farce called `` Hark_,_Hark_,_the_Lark '' ! 
968	br-c01	18	57	20228	It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season . 
969	br-c01	19	58	20242	If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find . 
970	br-c01	19	59	20258	Perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare_state in England still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics . 
971	br-c01	20	60	20284	Anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions . 
972	br-c01	20	61	20296	One is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm . 
973	br-c01	20	62	20305	Another is a wily countryman called Larkin , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled , I believe , in earlier volumes of Mr._Bates ' comedie_humaine . 
974	br-c01	21	63	20332	What 's up now ? 
975	br-c01	21	64	20337	Well , Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities . 
976	br-c01	22	65	20362	They want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor_house , or some modest little place where Shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for Great_Elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers . 
977	br-c01	23	66	20395	They are willing to settle , however , in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work_at . 
978	br-c01	23	67	20416	And of_course Larkin has just the thing they want . 
979	br-c01	24	68	20426	It 's a horror . 
980	br-c01	24	69	20431	The name of_it is Gore_Court , and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress T._S._Eliot . 
981	br-c01	24	70	20449	That 's not precisely the way Larkin urges them to look_at it , though . 
982	br-c01	24	71	20464	He conjures herds of deer , and wild birds crowding the air . 
983	br-c01	25	72	20477	He suggests that Gore_Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor . 
984	br-c01	25	73	20489	The stained-glass_windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas , the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political_platform . 
985	br-c01	25	74	20511	The vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a_thousand unexpected guests for lunch . 
986	br-c01	26	75	20535	Larkin has an answer to all that . 
987	br-c01	26	76	20543	The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas , for_example , will provide needed space for the extra television_sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids . 
988	br-c01	26	77	20570	Also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented . 
989	br-c01	27	78	20586	It 's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse . 
990	br-c01	27	79	20609	He does n't really need the immense sum_of_money ( probably converted from American gold on the London_Exchange ) he makes them pay . 
991	br-c01	28	80	20632	For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot . 
992	br-c01	28	81	20642	He has a glorious wife and many children . 
993	br-c01	28	82	20651	When he needs money to buy something like , say , the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable_patch , he takes_a_flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies . 
994	br-c01	28	83	20680	One of those capital-gains ventures , in_fact , has saddled him with Gore_Court . 
995	br-c01	28	84	20694	He is willing to sell it just to get_it_off_his_hands . 
996	br-c01	29	85	20704	And the Jerebohms are more_than willing to buy it . 
997	br-c01	29	86	20714	They plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox 's life on earth . 
998	br-c01	30	87	20734	If , in Larkin 's eyes , they are nothing but Piccadilly farmers , he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living . 
999	br-c01	31	88	20769	Mr._Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc . 
1000	br-c01	31	89	20781	Oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war . 
1001	br-c01	32	90	20792	First the Larkins are ahead , then the Jerebohms . 
1002	br-c01	32	91	20802	After Larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants , he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers . 
1003	br-c01	32	92	20831	One of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left_over from Kipling 's tales of India , does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds . 
1004	br-c01	33	93	20860	He does n't think that potting them from a deck_chair on the south_side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting . 
1005	br-c01	33	94	20888	But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish . 
1006	br-c01	34	95	20898	It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel_de_Cervantes ' `` Don_Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide_screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth_Street and Sixty-eighth_Street_Playhouses . 
1007	br-c01	35	96	20940	More_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho_Panza , in seventeenth century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . 
1008	br-c01	36	97	20985	Nikolai_Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander_Nevsky and Ivan_the_Terrible , performs the lanky Don_Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . 
1009	br-c01	37	98	21027	His addle-brained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no_doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues . 
1010	br-c01	38	99	21088	Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do . 
1011	br-c01	38	100	21103	He treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect . 
1012	br-c01	38	101	21118	Directed by Grigory_Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world . 
1013	br-c01	39	102	21147	The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English_language that has been excellently dubbed in_place_of the Russian dialogue . 
1014	br-c01	39	103	21172	The voices of all the characters , including that of Cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities . 
1015	br-c01	39	104	21196	And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed . 
1016	br-c01	39	105	21207	Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here . 
1017	br-c01	40	106	21226	Splendid , too , is the performance of Yuri_Tolubeyev , one of Russia 's leading comedians , as Sancho_Panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire '' . 
1018	br-c01	40	107	21254	Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness - a sort_of peasant dignity - too . 
1019	br-c01	40	108	21282	It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons . 
1020	br-c01	41	109	21304	The episode in which Sancho_Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island '' is one of the best in the film . 
1021	br-c01	42	110	21338	True , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a_bit wearisome in the first_half , before Don_Quixote goes to the duke 's court . 
1022	br-c01	42	111	21368	But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old_boy . 
1023	br-c01	43	112	21393	There are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange . 
1024	br-c01	44	113	21433	Also on the bill at the Fifty-fifth_Street is a nice ten minute color film called `` Sunday_in_Greenwich_Village '' , a tour of the haunts and joints . 
1025	br-c02	1	1	21460	Television has yet to work_out a living_arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family . 
1026	br-c02	2	2	21489	There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago style jazz in prime evening time , for_example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary . 
1027	br-c02	2	3	21522	At_least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` Chicago and All That Jazz '' , presented on NBC - TV Nov. 26 . 
1028	br-c02	3	4	21547	The program came_out of the NBC Special Projects department , and was slotted in the Du_Pont_Show of the Week series . 
1029	br-c02	3	5	21568	Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines . 
1030	br-c02	3	6	21577	If so , it might be worth_while to assign a future jazz show to a different department - one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut_down on the number of performers and give them a_little room to display their talents . 
1031	br-c02	4	7	21620	As_a_matter_of_fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results . 
1032	br-c02	4	8	21635	A_few years ago a `` Timex All Star Jazz Show '' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from Lionel_Hampton 's big_band to the free-wheeling Dukes_of_Dixieland . 
1033	br-c02	4	9	21663	An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live '' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance . 
1034	br-c02	5	10	21695	About that same time John_Crosby 's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing_space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do . 
1035	br-c02	5	11	21726	In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods . 
1036	br-c02	5	12	21749	The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music . 
1037	br-c02	5	13	21768	Cameras stared at soloists ' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled_back for full views of ensemble work . 
1038	br-c02	6	14	21788	`` Chicago and All_That_Jazz '' could not be faulted on the choice of artists . 
1039	br-c02	6	15	21803	Some of the in-person performers were Jack_Teagarden , Gene_Krupa , Bud_Freeman , Pee_Wee_Russell , Johnny_St._Cyr , Joe_Sullivan , Red_Allen , Lil_Armstrong , Blossom_Seeley . 
1040	br-c02	6	16	21827	The jazz buff could hardly ask for more . 
1041	br-c02	7	17	21836	Furthermore , Garry_Moore makes an ideal master_of_ceremonies . 
1042	br-c02	7	18	21844	( He played host at the Timex show already mentioned . ) 
1043	br-c02	8	19	21856	One of the script 's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today . 
1044	br-c02	8	20	21881	NBC had gathered a_lot of historical material which it was eager to share . 
1045	br-c02	8	21	21895	For_example , there was sheet_music with the word `` jazz '' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took_hold . 
1046	br-c02	8	22	21920	Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone_poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 's . 
1047	br-c02	9	23	21950	However well_chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening 's main business , which ( considering the talent at_hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style . 
1048	br-c02	10	24	21996	Another source of NBC pride was its rare film_clip of Bix_Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew_by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted_out the entire glimpse . 
1049	br-c02	10	25	22029	Similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz_groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal . 
1050	br-c02	11	26	22049	`` Chicago and All That Jazz '' may have wound_up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer . 
1051	br-c02	11	27	22069	By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artists , the program turned_out to be a not quite perfect example of either . 
1052	br-c02	11	28	22102	Still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated . 
1053	br-c02	12	29	22125	Even Joan_Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan_Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti 's `` Lucia_di_Lammermoor '' Sunday night . 
1054	br-c02	13	30	22154	The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing_ovation as Miss_Sutherland took curtain_call after curtain_call following a fantastic `` Mad_Scene '' created on_her_own and with the help of the composer and the other performers . 
1055	br-c02	14	31	22197	Her entrance in Scene_2_,_Act_1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note . 
1056	br-c02	14	32	22214	Thereafter the audience waxed applause happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization . 
1057	br-c02	14	33	22245	As she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` Lucia '' . 
1058	br-c02	14	34	22278	She topped the sextet brilliantly . 
1059	br-c02	15	35	22284	Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` Mad_Scene '' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment . 
1060	br-c02	15	36	22321	Miss_Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene : A much more girlish Lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role . 
1061	br-c02	15	37	22355	What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss_Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today . 
1062	br-c02	16	38	22377	This big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined . 
1063	br-c02	16	39	22390	Nervousness at_the_start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene , or she may warm_up slowly . 
1064	br-c02	16	40	22408	In the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently . 
1065	br-c02	17	41	22426	Technically it was fascinating , aurally spell-binding , and dramatically quite realistic . 
1066	br-c02	17	42	22439	Many years have passed since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable . 
1067	br-c02	17	43	22451	Her debut over , perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine . 
1068	br-c02	18	44	22464	The performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor , Silvio_Varviso . 
1069	br-c02	18	45	22479	He injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years . 
1070	br-c02	18	46	22494	He may respect too_much the Italian tradition of letting singers hold_on to their notes , but to restrain them in a singers ' opera may be quite difficult . 
1071	br-c02	19	47	22523	Richard_Tucker sang Edgardo in glorious voice . 
1072	br-c02	19	48	22530	His bel_canto style gave the performance a special distinction . 
1073	br-c02	19	49	22540	The remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more_than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage_direction proved only serviceable . 
1074	br-c02	20	50	22563	Miss_Sutherland first sang Lucia at Covent_Garden in 1959 . 
1075	br-c02	20	51	22572	( The first Metropolitan_Opera broadcast on Dec. 9 will introduce her as Lucia . ) 
1076	br-c02	20	52	22587	She has since turned_to Bellini , whose opera `` Beatrice_di_Tenda '' in a concert version with the American_Opera_Society introduced her to New_York last season . 
1077	br-c02	20	53	22612	She will sing `` La_Sonambula '' with it here next week . 
1078	br-c02	21	54	22624	Anyone for musical Ping-pong ? 
1079	br-c02	22	55	22629	It 's really quite fun_- as_long_as you like games . 
1080	br-c02	22	56	22639	You will need a stereo music system , with speakers preferably placed at_least seven or eight feet apart , and one or more of the new London `` Phase 4 '' records . 
1081	br-c02	22	57	22672	There are 12 of these to choose from , all_of them of popular_music except for the star release , Pass_in_Review ( SP 44001 ) . 
1082	br-c02	22	58	22697	This features the marching songs of several nations , recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing_stand . 
1083	br-c02	22	59	22719	Complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet_planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays London 's new technique to the best effect . 
1084	br-c02	23	60	22747	All_of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program . 
1085	br-c02	23	61	22763	No reference is made to the possibility of recording other_than popular_music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious_music . 
1086	br-c02	23	62	22790	Directionality is greatly exaggerated most_of the time ; but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music . 
1087	br-c02	23	63	22821	You definitely hear some of the instruments close_up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back . 
1088	br-c02	23	64	22858	This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound . 
1089	br-c02	24	65	22876	London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels . 
1090	br-c02	24	66	22912	These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record . 
1091	br-c02	24	67	22942	In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special_effects . 
1092	br-c02	25	68	22969	Some clue to the character of London 's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' . 
1093	br-c02	25	69	23005	Drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive_instruments are reproduced remarkably well . 
1094	br-c02	25	70	23019	Only_too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined_up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right . 
1095	br-c02	25	71	23058	They are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis_court watching a spirited volley . 
1096	br-c02	26	72	23091	The Percussive Twenties ( SP 44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day , and Johnny_Keating 's Kombo gives_forth with tingling jazz in Percussive_Moods ( SP 44005 ) . 
1097	br-c02	26	73	23123	Big_Band_Percussion ( SP 44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs - the arrangements just did n't have so much character as the others . 
1098	br-c02	27	74	23149	There is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings , apparently obtained at_least in part by emphasizing the middle and high_frequencies . 
1099	br-c02	27	75	23174	The penalty for this is noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sounds in Melody_and_Percussion_for_Two_Pianos ( SP 44007 ) . 
1100	br-c02	27	76	23199	All_of the releases , however , are recorded at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface_noise . 
1101	br-c02	27	77	23220	Pass_in_Review practically guarantees enjoyment , and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system . 
1102	br-c02	28	78	23239	Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic . 
1103	br-c02	29	79	23252	Strange , but true - authenticity and realism often are n't related at_all . 
1104	br-c02	30	80	23266	Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic - in_fact , impeccably so . 
1105	br-c02	30	81	23283	In any given period_piece the costumes , bric-a-brac , vehicles , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity . 
1106	br-c02	31	82	23304	The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter . 
1107	br-c02	31	83	23322	During the making recently of an important Biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not_only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports_arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with . 
1108	br-c02	32	84	23367	But , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set 's edge . 
1109	br-c02	32	85	23382	The drama itself - and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama - often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at_all . 
1110	br-c02	32	86	23406	The storyline , in sort , is wildly unrealistic . 
1111	br-c02	33	87	23416	Thus , in `` The_Story_of_Ruth '' we have Ruth , Naomi , and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic . 
1112	br-c02	33	88	23437	But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline - i.e. , that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound_up with Boaz - the film version has little to do with the Bible . 
1113	br-c02	34	89	23472	And in the new `` King_of_Kings '' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the Gospels . 
1114	br-c02	35	90	23495	Earlier this month Edward_R._Murrow , director of the United_States_Information_Agency , came to Hollywood and had dinner with more_than 100 leaders of the motion_picture industry . 
1115	br-c02	36	91	23520	He talked_about unauthentic storylines too . 
1116	br-c02	36	92	23526	He intimated that they were n't doing the country much good in the Cold_War . 
1117	br-c02	36	93	23541	And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism . 
1118	br-c02	37	94	23556	`` in many corners of the globe '' , he said , `` the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet . 
1119	br-c02	37	95	23584	Would we want a future-day Gibbon or Macaulay recounting the saga of America with movies as his prime source of knowledge ? 
1120	br-c02	37	96	23606	Yet for much of the globe , Hollywood is just that - prime , if_not sole , source of knowledge . 
1121	br-c02	37	97	23627	If a man totally ignorant of America were to judge our land and its civilization based on Hollywood alone , what conclusions do you think he might come_to ? 
1122	br-c04	1	1	23656	The Theatre-By-The-Sea , Matunuck , presents `` King_of_Hearts '' by Jean_Kerr and Eleanor_Brooke . 
1123	br-c04	1	2	23670	Directed by Michael_Murray ; settings by William_David_Roberts . 
1124	br-c04	1	3	23678	The cast : 
1125	br-c04	2	4	23681	Producer_John_Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season 's opener at Matunuck in Jean_Kerr 's `` King_of_Hearts '' . 
1126	br-c04	3	5	23701	The dialogue is sharp , witty and candid - typical `` do n't eat the daisies '' material - which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays , and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience liked it . 
1127	br-c04	4	6	23742	The story is of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10 - year old to provide him with fresh idea material . 
1128	br-c04	5	7	23777	This is when his troubles begin , not_to_mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns_out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect_to the hero 's sweetheart secretary . 
1129	br-c04	6	8	23811	John_Heffernan , playing Larry_Larkin , the cartoonist , carries_the_show in marvelous fashion . 
1130	br-c04	6	9	23824	His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless . 
1131	br-c04	7	10	23835	This may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of David_Hedison , Providence 's contribution to Hollywood , who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th_Century-Fox . 
1132	br-c04	7	11	23863	Not that Mr._Hedison does not make the most of his role . 
1133	br-c04	7	12	23875	He does , and more . 
1134	br-c04	7	13	23881	But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way . 
1135	br-c04	8	14	23900	A word should be said for Gary_Morgan , a Broadway youngsters who , as the adopted son , makes life miserable for nearly everybody and Larkin in particular . 
1136	br-c04	8	15	23929	And for his playmate , Francis_Coletta of West_Warwick , who has a bit_part , Billy . 
1137	br-c04	9	16	23945	On_the_whole , audiences will like this performance . 
1138	br-c04	9	17	23953	It is a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the Matunuck cast does_well by it . 
1139	br-c04	10	18	23972	The Newport_Playhouse presents `` Epitaph_For_George_Dillon '' by John_Osborne and Anthony_Creighton , directed by Wallace_Gray . 
1140	br-c04	11	19	23987	The cast : 
1141	br-c04	12	20	23990	The angriest young_man in Newport last night was at the Playhouse , where `` Epitaph_for_George_Dillon '' opened as the jazz_festival closed . 
1142	br-c04	13	21	24012	For the hero of this work by John_Osborne and Anthony_Creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam_session . 
1143	br-c04	13	22	24037	He 's mad at a world he did not make . 
1144	br-c04	14	23	24048	Furthermore , he 's something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips . 
1145	br-c04	14	24	24067	This is in contrast to the family with whom he boards . 
1146	br-c04	14	25	24079	They not_only think and feel cliches but live cliches as_well . 
1147	br-c04	15	26	24090	It is into this household , one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people , that George_Dillon enters at the beginning of the play . 
1148	br-c04	16	27	24120	An unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists . 
1149	br-c04	16	28	24142	By the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells . 
1150	br-c04	17	29	24166	Not altogether a successful play , `` Epitaph_for_George_Dillon '' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling . 
1151	br-c04	17	30	24190	It is awfully talky , for_instance , and not all_of the talk is terribly impressive . 
1152	br-c04	17	31	24206	But it strikes sparks on_occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten . 
1153	br-c04	18	32	24221	There is a fine second act , as an example , one in which Samuel_Groom , as Dillon , has an opportunity to blaze_away in one impassioned passage after another . 
1154	br-c04	18	33	24252	This is an exciting young actor to watch . 
1155	br-c04	19	34	24261	Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura_Stuart , whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch . 
1156	br-c04	19	35	24286	Miss_Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment . 
1157	br-c04	20	36	24307	Also fine are Sue_Lawless , as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive , Harold_Cherry , as her scratchy spouse , and Hildy_Weissman , as a vegetable in human form . 
1158	br-c04	21	37	24345	Wallace_Gray has directed a difficult play here , usually well , but with just a_bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste . 
1159	br-c04	21	38	24372	Still , his finale is put_together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance , despair . 
1160	br-c04	22	39	24392	The_Warwick_Musical_Theater presents `` Where's_Charley ? '' 
1161	br-c04	22	40	24398	with music and lyrics by Frank_Loesser , directed by Christopher_Hewett , choreography by Peter_Conlow , musical direction by Samuel_Matlowsky . 
1162	br-c04	22	41	24418	The cast : 
1163	br-c04	23	42	24421	Everybody fell_in_love with Amy again last night at the Warwick_Musical_Theater , and Shelley_Berman was to blame . 
1164	br-c04	24	43	24438	One of the finest soft_shoe tunes ever invented , `` Once_in_Love_with_Amy '' is also , of_course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love_lyrics to come_out of American musical_comedy in our era . 
1165	br-c04	24	44	24473	So the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after Act 2 , got a rousing opening chorus , `` Where's_Charley ? '' 
1166	br-c04	24	45	24498	, and Berman sifted_out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being . 
1167	br-c04	25	46	24521	It is greatly to Berman 's credit that he made no attempt to outdo Ray_Bolger . 
1168	br-c04	25	47	24537	He dropped his earlier and delightful hamming , which is about the only way to handle the old war_horse called `` Charley's_Aunt '' , and let himself go_with as an appealing an `` Amy '' as anybody could ask . 
1169	br-c04	26	48	24577	In_brief , Berman played himself and not Bolger . 
1170	br-c04	26	49	24586	The big audience started applauding even before he had finished . 
1171	br-c04	27	50	24597	The whole production this week is fresh and lively . 
1172	br-c04	27	51	24607	The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture_hats of the Gibson_Girl days . 
1173	br-c04	27	52	24623	The ballet work is on_the_nose , especially in the opening number by `` The_New_Ashmolean_Marching_Society and Students_'_Conservatory_Band '' , along with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia later . 
1174	br-c04	28	53	24651	Berman , whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night_club monologist , proved himself very much at_home in musical_comedy . 
1175	br-c04	29	54	24676	Sparrow size Virginia_Gibson , with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile , made a suitably perky Amy , while Melisande_Congdon , as the real aunt , was positively monumental in the very best Gibson_Girl manner . 
1176	br-c04	30	55	24713	All_told , `` Where's_Charley ? '' ought not to be missed . 
1177	br-c04	30	56	24725	It has a fast pace , excellent music , expert direction , and not_only a good comedian , but an appealing person in his own right , Mr._Berman . 
1178	br-c04	31	57	24754	The Broadway_Theater_League_of_Rhode_Island presents C._Edwin_Knill 's and Martin_Tahse 's production of `` Fiorello ! '' 
1179	br-c04	31	58	24768	at Veterans_Memorial_Auditorium . 
1180	br-c04	31	59	24771	The book is by Jerome_Weidman and George_Abbott , music by Jerry_Bock , lyrics by Sheldon_Harnick , choreography by Peter_Gennaro , scenery , costumes and lighting by William and Jean_Eckart , musical direction by Jack_Elliott , and the production was directed by Mr._Abbott . 
1181	br-c04	31	60	24814	The cast : 
1182	br-c04	32	61	24817	This is one of the happier events of the season . 
1183	br-c04	33	62	24828	The company which performed the Pulitzer_Prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce , the politicians are in fine voice , the chorines evoke happy memories , and the Little_Flower rides to break a lance again . 
1184	br-c04	34	63	24872	I saw `` Fiorello ! '' performed in New_York by the original cast and I think this company is every_bit as good , and perhaps better . 
1185	br-c04	35	64	24899	Certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking . 
1186	br-c04	35	65	24910	Bob_Carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom_Bosley does , but I was amazed at the way he became more_and_more Fiorello as the evening progressed , until one had to catch_one's_self_up and remember that this was n't really LaGuardia come_back among us again . 
1187	br-c04	36	66	24960	Then Rudy_Bond was simply grand as Ben , the distraught Republican_Party district chieftain . 
1188	br-c04	36	67	24974	And Paul_Lipson , as Morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley 's dinner , was fine , too . 
1189	br-c04	37	68	24998	As for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man . 
1190	br-c04	37	69	25027	Charlotte_Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie , who became the second Mrs._LaGuardia , singing and acting with remarkable conviction . 
1191	br-c04	37	70	25048	Jen_Nelson , as Thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive . 
1192	br-c04	37	71	25065	And little Zeme_North , a Dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings . 
1193	br-c04	38	72	25111	Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` On_the_Side_of_the_Angels '' and `` Politics_and_Poker '' were handled splendidly , and I thought Rudy_Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` Little_Tin_Box '' even better than it was done by the New_York cast ; all the words of its clever lyrics came_through with perfect clarity . 
1194	br-c04	39	73	25170	The party at Floyd 's penthouse gave the `` chorines '' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era 's nonsense . 
1195	br-c04	40	74	25205	LaGuardia 's multi lingual rallies , when he is running for Congress , are well staged , and wind_up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical_theater . 
1196	br-c04	41	75	25235	Martin_Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions . 
1197	br-c04	41	76	25251	Not a corner has been visibly cut in this one . 
1198	br-c04	41	77	25262	The sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that does n't pause long in any one place , and they are devised so_that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness . 
1199	br-c04	41	78	25295	( Several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in_front_of their eyes . 
1200	br-c04	41	79	25331	I'm glad to say there 's none of that distraction in this `` Fiorello ! '' 
1201	br-c04	41	80	25347	) 
1202	br-c04	42	81	25348	It has all been done in superb style , and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical_theater . 
1203	br-c04	43	82	25376	Loew_'s_Theater presents `` Where_the_Boys_are '' , an MGM picture produced by Joe_Pasternak and directed by Henry_Levin from a screenplay by George_Wells . 
1204	br-c04	43	83	25398	The cast : 
1205	br-c04	44	84	25401	Since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , is a rich Brown senior , while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists , I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on `` Where_the_Boys_are '' , but I shall do nothing of the sort . 
1206	br-c04	45	85	25450	Instead - and not just to prove my objectivity - I hasten to report that it 's a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort_Lauderdale , and that it seems to come_to_grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age_group - that_is_to_say , sex . 
1207	br-c04	46	86	25516	The answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual . 
1208	br-c04	46	87	25530	If most_of them were n't exactly specific - well , that 's the way it is in life , I guess . 
1209	br-c04	46	88	25552	But at_least it 's reassuring to see some teenagers who do n't profess to know all the answers and are thinking_about their problems instead . 
1210	br-c04	47	89	25577	`` Where_the_Boys_Are '' also has a juvenile bounce that makes_for a refreshing venture in comedy . 
1211	br-c04	47	90	25593	There are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations - the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a `` mermaid '' is performing . 
1212	br-c04	48	91	25628	Most of the female faces are new , or at_least not too familiar . 
1213	br-c04	48	92	25642	Dolores_Hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable . 
1214	br-c04	48	93	25655	I was delighted with Paula_Prentiss ' comedy performance , which was as fresh and unstilted as one 's highest hopes might ask . 
1215	br-c04	48	94	25678	A_couple_of the males made good comedy , too - Jim_Hutton and Frank_Gorshin . 
1216	br-c04	49	95	25691	The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette_Mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , I suppose this was the attitude the part called_for . 
1217	br-c04	49	96	25738	I must say , however , that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it . 
1218	br-c04	50	97	25759	To anyone who remembers Newport at its less_than maximum violence , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz_Festival ought to prove entertaining . 
1219	br-c04	51	98	25794	The second feature , `` The_Price_of_Silence '' , is a British detective_story that will talk_your_head_off . 
1220	br-d01	1	1	25810	As a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as_to the meaning of the basic terms employed . 
1221	br-d01	1	2	25836	Just what is meant by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ? 
1222	br-d01	1	3	25850	The terms are generally taken_for_granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all . 
1223	br-d01	1	4	25871	Yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must_not do . 
1224	br-d01	1	5	25884	For in the modern_world neither `` spirit '' nor `` matter '' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience . 
1225	br-d01	1	6	25905	We are in a transitional stage in which many_of the connotations of former usage have had_to be revised or rejected . 
1226	br-d01	1	7	25926	When the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have_in_mind , or to_what_extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours . 
1227	br-d01	2	8	25959	One of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit . 
1228	br-d01	2	9	25979	Just a_few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities . 
1229	br-d01	2	10	25999	Not_only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as_well was this true . 
1230	br-d01	2	11	26015	Demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual_beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars . 
1231	br-d01	2	12	26047	In such a world the words `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all . 
1232	br-d01	2	13	26073	In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in_general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously . 
1233	br-d01	3	14	26104	The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit_world of the entities which previously populated it . 
1234	br-d01	3	15	26140	In carrying_out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . 
1235	br-d01	3	16	26160	The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support . 
1236	br-d01	3	17	26185	Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time . 
1237	br-d01	3	18	26206	When , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality . 
1238	br-d01	3	19	26245	In doing so science has unquestionably cleared_up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions . 
1239	br-d01	3	20	26270	There have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful . 
1240	br-d01	4	21	26300	All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing . 
1241	br-d01	4	22	26312	The scientific debunking of the spirit_world has been in_a_way too successful and too thorough . 
1242	br-d01	4	23	26327	The house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means , or at_best with wholly inadequate means , for dealing with his experience of spirit . 
1243	br-d01	4	24	26359	Although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever . 
1244	br-d01	4	25	26398	We simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience . 
1245	br-d01	4	26	26423	There is no framework or structure of thought with_respect_to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with_respect_to which we can refer this experience . 
1246	br-d01	4	27	26458	Science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives . 
1247	br-d01	5	28	26474	The situation in which we find ourselves is brought_out with dramatic force in Arthur_Miller 's play The_Crucible , which deals with the Salem witch trials . 
1248	br-d01	5	29	26500	As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century . 
1249	br-d01	5	30	26524	Aside_from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community . 
1250	br-d01	5	31	26549	The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age . 
1251	br-d01	5	32	26584	There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people . 
1252	br-d01	5	33	26597	Instead , the audience can sit_back at_ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no_longer believes_in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion . 
1253	br-d01	5	34	26640	A teenage girl , Abigail_Williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the Reverend_Samuel_Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings . 
1254	br-d01	5	35	26684	For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air . 
1255	br-d01	6	36	26729	As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community . 
1256	br-d01	6	37	26760	Everyone in Salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept_up by it . 
1257	br-d01	6	38	26774	It is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with Abigail and Parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it . 
1258	br-d01	6	39	26808	It grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction . 
1259	br-d01	6	40	26831	The audience leaves the play under a spell , It is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes . 
1260	br-d01	7	41	26859	If one asks about this play , what it is that comes_upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit '' . 
1261	br-d01	7	42	26894	This is not to attempt to say what spirit is , but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience . 
1262	br-d01	7	43	26922	In_the_end the good man , John_Proctor , expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says , `` A fire , a fire is burning ! 
1263	br-d01	7	44	26951	I hear the boot of Lucifer , I see his filthy face '' ! 
1264	br-d01	7	45	26965	The tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set_out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them . 
1265	br-d01	7	46	27014	We marvel at their blindness for not seeing this . 
1266	br-d01	7	47	27024	Yet are not we of the mid twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there is any such `` thing '' as the devil , just as bad off as they - only in a different way ? 
1267	br-d01	7	48	27063	In our disbelief we think that we can no_longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in_this play . 
1268	br-d01	7	49	27094	We are left helpless to cope_with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false . 
1269	br-d01	8	50	27133	Even Mr._Miller himself seems uncertain on this score . 
1270	br-d01	8	51	27142	In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point : `` However , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer 's many faced lieutenants . 
1271	br-d01	8	52	27197	And his belief is not to his discredit . 
1272	br-d01	8	53	27206	Better minds than Hale 's were - and still are - convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken '' . 
1273	br-d01	8	54	27230	( page 33 ) On_the_other_hand , a_little later_on he says : 
1274	br-d01	8	55	27241	`` Since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped_out God 's beard and the Devil 's horns , but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes . 
1275	br-d01	8	56	27272	The concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon - such a concept is still reserved to the physical_sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas . 
1276	br-d01	8	57	27328	When we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man 's worthlessness - until redeemed - the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time_and_time_again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state '' . 
1277	br-d01	9	58	27384	Apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think_of the devil as being actually real . 
1278	br-d01	9	59	27406	Yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over Salem . 
1279	br-d01	9	60	27437	It casts a spell upon them so_that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power . 
1280	br-d01	9	61	27461	It is not enough in accounting_for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect . 
1281	br-d01	9	62	27486	For this does not account_for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell . 
1282	br-d01	9	63	27530	The reality of spirit emerges in_this play in_spite_of the author 's convictions to_the_contrary . 
1283	br-d01	10	64	27544	There is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit . 
1284	br-d01	10	65	27563	Apart from spirit there could be no community , for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence . 
1285	br-d01	10	66	27594	Think , for_example , of the spirit of the Marine_Corps . 
1286	br-d01	10	67	27605	Surely this is a reality we all acknowledge . 
1287	br-d01	10	68	27614	We cannot , of_course , assign it any substance . 
1288	br-d01	10	69	27624	It is not material and is not a `` thing '' occupying space and time . 
1289	br-d01	10	70	27640	Yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known . 
1290	br-d01	10	71	27655	So it is too with many other spirits which we all know : the spirit of Nazism or Communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street_corner gang or a football_team , the spirit of Rotary or the Ku_Klux_Klan . 
1291	br-d01	10	72	27696	Every community , if it is alive has a spirit , and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity . 
1292	br-d01	11	73	27719	In searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful . 
1293	br-d01	11	74	27752	For it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit . 
1294	br-d01	11	75	27765	It is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere . 
1295	br-d01	11	76	27780	It is the spirit which is the source of a community 's drawing_power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so_that the community grows and prospers . 
1296	br-d01	11	77	27813	Yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community . 
1297	br-d01	11	78	27827	The idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas . 
1298	br-d01	12	79	27843	One characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness . 
1299	br-d01	12	80	27854	The members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them . 
1300	br-d01	12	81	27874	It is for them a given which they and they alone possess . 
1301	br-d01	12	82	27887	The spirit of the Marine_Corps was present and operative before any of the present members of_it came into it . 
1302	br-d01	12	83	27907	It is they , of_course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the Corps for future recruits to find as they come into it . 
1303	br-d02	1	1	27943	If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people '' - and this , it must_not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task - there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation . 
1304	br-d02	2	2	28000	This does not mean that mythological language as_such can no_longer be used in theology and preaching . 
1305	br-d02	2	3	28017	The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann 's intention . 
1306	br-d02	2	4	28035	His point is not that mythology may_not be used , but that it may no_longer be regarded_as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma . 
1307	br-d02	2	5	28066	When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence . 
1308	br-d02	2	6	28100	Mythological concepts may by_all_means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that_is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in non mythological ( or existential ) terms . 
1309	br-d02	3	7	28142	The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith '' . 
1310	br-d02	3	8	28177	But this statement is completely unconvincing . 
1311	br-d02	3	9	28184	If Bultmann 's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant . 
1312	br-d02	3	10	28241	Nor is it necessary to look_for such evidence in the great urban_centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated . 
1313	br-d02	3	11	28278	On_the_contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible_belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological_revolutions have long been under_way , together with the corresponding changes in man 's picture of himself and his world . 
1314	br-d02	4	12	28329	In_fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann 's argument is disclosed . 
1315	br-d02	4	13	28348	Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence . 
1316	br-d02	4	14	28387	This is especially in_evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle_class . 
1317	br-d02	4	15	28400	Time_and_again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern_world are only_too painfully obvious . 
1318	br-d02	5	16	28442	The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture Protestantism '' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches . 
1319	br-d02	5	17	28469	In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at_hand - and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation . 
1320	br-d02	5	18	28520	This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman_Vincent_Peale 's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel . 
1321	br-d02	5	19	28559	But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most_of the pundits seem to have suspected . 
1322	br-d02	6	20	28583	However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at_least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace . 
1323	br-d02	6	21	28630	To_be_sure , when this is pointed_out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from Paul 's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of First_Corinthians . 
1324	br-d02	6	22	28681	But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indignation ? 
1325	br-d02	6	23	28694	Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking_about the same thing ? 
1326	br-d02	6	24	28749	Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? 
1327	br-d02	7	25	28777	There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world . 
1328	br-d02	7	26	28828	by analogy , the church also has been regarded_as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in_order to be the church . 
1329	br-d02	7	27	28858	But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a_fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God 's providence , presents it . 
1330	br-d02	8	28	28901	And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men . 
1331	br-d02	8	29	28942	Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends . 
1332	br-d02	9	30	28977	In arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set_forth reasons to justify such a conviction . 
1333	br-d02	9	31	29020	But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable . 
1334	br-d02	10	32	29047	This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition . 
1335	br-d02	10	33	29063	If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right to say anything at_all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian . 
1336	br-d02	10	34	29103	Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus_Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind - sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus - then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid . 
1337	br-d02	11	35	29149	This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter . 
1338	br-d02	11	36	29166	Modern man , as Dietrich_Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come_of_age '' ; and though this process by_no_means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in_fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it . 
1339	br-d02	11	37	29237	In_any_event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at_all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen_fit to place us . 
1340	br-d02	12	38	29277	To say this , of_course , is to take_up a position on one side of a controversy going_on now for some two hundred years , or , at_any_rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought . 
1341	br-d02	12	39	29318	We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at_least , Bultmann . 
1342	br-d02	12	40	29370	It is to this same tradition that most_of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong . 
1343	br-d02	12	41	29394	For we must number here not_only the names of Bushnell , Clarke , and Rauschenbusch , not_to_mention those of `` the Chicago_School '' and Macintosh , but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if America may claim him ! ) 
1344	br-d02	12	42	29435	Tillich as_well . 
1345	br-d02	12	43	29438	Finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that developed at the University_of_Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred_North_Whitehead . 
1346	br-d02	13	44	29471	What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged_to it have been profoundly in_earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern_world . 
1347	br-d02	13	45	29500	Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity . 
1348	br-d02	13	46	29531	They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked_upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him . 
1349	br-d02	14	47	29570	When we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at_least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement . 
1350	br-d02	14	48	29610	However much we may have to criticize liberal theology 's constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it . 
1351	br-d02	15	49	29641	In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann 's attempt to formulate such a theology has led . 
1352	br-d02	15	50	29668	For we have said , in_effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative . 
1353	br-d02	15	51	29701	If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable . 
1354	br-d02	15	52	29728	Whereas Bultmann 's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl_Barth , involves the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered . 
1355	br-d02	16	53	29788	It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz_Buri and , to some extent at_least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology . 
1356	br-d02	17	54	29844	In_order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . 
1357	br-d02	18	55	29866	We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri . 
1358	br-d02	18	56	29892	To do this , it is sufficient to point_out that if the principle in_terms_of which alternatives are to be conceived is such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question . 
1359	br-d02	18	57	29933	Thus , if what is at_issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case the judgment in_question is false . 
1360	br-d02	18	58	29977	Hence , if what is in_question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a_little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded . 
1361	br-d02	18	59	30025	Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on_the_one_hand , by the two at_least apparently self-consistent but mutually_exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on_the_other_hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann . 
1362	br-d02	19	60	30071	A second point requires more extended comment . 
1363	br-d02	19	61	30079	It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represented by Barth , rests_on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann 's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at_least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus_Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann 's point_of_view , are mythological . 
1364	br-d03	1	1	30182	One_hundred years ago there existed in England the Association_for_the_Promotion_of_the_Unity_of_Christendom . 
1365	br-d03	1	2	30192	Representing as_it_did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman and Anglican_Churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in_fact , was condemned by the Holy_Office in 1864 . 
1366	br-d03	2	3	30234	Now again in 1961 , in England , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity . 
1367	br-d03	2	4	30257	The Church_Unity_Octave , January 18 - 25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches . 
1368	br-d03	2	5	30277	Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 . 
1369	br-d03	2	6	30309	But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at_least on the Catholic side . 
1370	br-d03	2	7	30340	For `` the_tide_is_well_on_the_turn '' , as the London_Catholic_weekly_Universe has written . 
1371	br-d03	3	8	30351	I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal_Newman . 
1372	br-d03	3	9	30367	As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant dominated country . 
1373	br-d03	3	10	30405	Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England . 
1374	br-d03	3	11	30423	In representing part of this new picture , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican_Churches and about the present religious state of England . 
1375	br-d03	4	12	30476	Since the Protestant clergy for_the_most_part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman_collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman_Catholic cleric . 
1376	br-d03	4	13	30507	In_any_case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen , even in Devonshire and Cornwall , where anti Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest . 
1377	br-d03	5	14	30539	Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism . 
1378	br-d03	5	15	30548	On my first Guy_Fawkes_Day here , I found Catholics as well as non Catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires , and was told that most Englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day . 
1379	br-d03	5	16	30592	A Birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled `` The True Story of Guy_Fawkes '' , which began : 
1380	br-d03	6	17	30615	`` When you pile your '' guy `` on the bonfire tomorrow night , I wonder how much of the true story of Guy_Fawkes you will remember ? 
1381	br-d03	6	18	30643	In the 355 years since the first Guy_Fawkes_Night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder '' . 
1382	br-d03	6	19	30667	The article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill King_James_/1_1 , . 
1383	br-d03	7	20	30684	In_spite_of the increase in numbers and prestige brought_about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840 's and 1850 's , the Catholic segment of England one_hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per_cent , or 800000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public . 
1384	br-d03	7	21	30740	The return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked_upon with indignant disapprobation and , in_fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty . 
1385	br-d03	7	22	30766	In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in_order_to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers . 
1386	br-d03	8	23	30792	Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per_cent , or 5 million ) ; yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population . 
1387	br-d03	8	24	30827	A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going_in and out of the Birmingham_Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday mornings . 
1388	br-d03	8	25	30851	She found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per_cent of English_people are churchgoers . 
1389	br-d03	8	26	30870	She may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less_than ten . 
1390	br-d03	8	27	30894	From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all_but empty during services . 
1391	br-d03	8	28	30916	A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city_university , following Anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated Mass before more_than a_hundred . 
1392	br-d03	9	29	30950	The Protestants themselves are the first to admit the great falling_off in effective membership in their churches . 
1393	br-d03	9	30	30968	According_to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church_of_England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9748000 , but only 2887671 are registered on the parochial church_rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church_of_England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' . 
1394	br-d03	9	31	31024	An amazing article in the Manchester_Guardian of last November , entitled `` Fate of Redundant Churches '' , states than an Archbishops ' Commission `` reported last month that in the Church_of_England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years ' time . 
1395	br-d03	9	32	31075	A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 '' . 
1396	br-d03	9	33	31087	And in the last five years , the `` Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels '' . 
1397	br-d03	9	34	31115	Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman_Catholics '' , and have done so . 
1398	br-d03	10	35	31145	While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population_shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going_to church . 
1399	br-d03	10	36	31187	It should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics ( one paper writes 50 per_cent ) . 
1400	br-d03	10	37	31213	Still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing . 
1401	br-d03	11	38	31240	An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true . 
1402	br-d03	11	39	31256	A century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English_Protestantism , and that even high_Anglicanism would someday no_longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own '' . 
1403	br-d03	11	40	31304	That day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no_longer very meaningful to call England a `` Protestant country '' . 
1404	br-d03	11	41	31327	One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite . 
1405	br-d03	12	42	31353	Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy . 
1406	br-d03	12	43	31371	The London_Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping_out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one_hundred years . 
1407	br-d03	12	44	31393	With traditional nationalistic spirit , some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best . 
1408	br-d03	12	45	31410	I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics . 
1409	br-d03	12	46	31426	It has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass . 
1410	br-d03	13	47	31458	They hope , of_course , to reclaim the non-Catholic population to the Catholic faith , and at every Sunday Benediction they recite by_heart the `` Prayer_for_England '' : 
1411	br-d03	14	48	31486	`` O Blessed Virgin_Mary , Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon England , thy '' dowry `` , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee . 
1412	br-d03	14	49	31526	Intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd , the vicar of thy Son '' . 
1413	br-d03	14	50	31556	A hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is `` Faith_of_our_Fathers '' , which glories in England 's ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims : 
1414	br-d03	14	51	31585	`` Faith of our Fathers : Mary 's prayers / Shall win our country back to thee '' . 
1415	br-d03	14	52	31604	The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty_Martyrs and Cardinal_Newman will soon be canonized . 
1416	br-d03	15	53	31630	Because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , English Catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being `` English '' . 
1417	br-d03	15	54	31655	I have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in_the_air . 
1418	br-d03	15	55	31674	For_example , a writer in a recent number of The_Queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un English '' ' . 
1419	br-d03	15	56	31713	In this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in England , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good . 
1420	br-d03	16	57	31773	One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken_place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge_Universities . 
1421	br-d03	16	58	31797	At Oxford one_hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 . 
1422	br-d03	16	59	31818	Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs . 
1423	br-d03	16	60	31839	Now , not_only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious_orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non_Catholic members of the University . 
1424	br-d03	16	61	31876	Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students . 
1425	br-d03	17	62	31895	Further evidence that Roman_Catholicism enjoys a more favorable_position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to_it in the mass_media of England . 
1426	br-d03	17	63	31919	The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester_Guardian and the Sunday_Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic_Church is now at_least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches . 
1427	br-d03	17	64	31955	On successive Sundays during October , 1960 , Paul_Ferris ( a non-Catholic ) wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen of the Church_of_England , the Church_of_Rome and the Nonconformist_Church . 
1428	br-d03	17	65	31985	The Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came_out the best . 
1429	br-d03	17	66	31999	There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very_much to do as clergyman . 
1430	br-d03	17	67	32036	Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public_press of mid Victorian England . 
1431	br-d03	17	68	32053	There was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on B.B.C. , where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson , a Free_Church minister and a Catholic priest . 
1432	br-d03	18	69	32088	Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television_programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen . 
1433	br-d03	18	70	32109	A notable example of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool , Dr._Heenan , and the Anglican Archbishop of York , Dr._Ramsey , recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury . 
1434	br-d03	18	71	32144	The good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well_known in England . 
1435	br-d03	18	72	32161	The Holy_Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months . 
1436	br-d03	18	73	32177	And it was interesting to observe that B.B.C. . 's television film on Christmas_Eve was The_Bells_of_St._Mary's . 
1437	br-d03	19	74	32194	Of_course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr._Fisher , then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury , to the Vatican last December . 
1438	br-d03	19	75	32230	It was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century . 
1439	br-d03	19	76	32246	English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope . 
1440	br-d03	20	77	32258	Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants ; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary_school during the sickness of one of its masters ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` Catholics , if the present system is still in_operation , will constitute almost one-third of the House_of_Lords in the next generation '' ; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic_church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave . 
1441	br-d04	1	1	32387	The death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal . 
1442	br-d04	1	2	32401	The straight_line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality . 
1443	br-d04	1	3	32413	But how can one figure symbolize both ? 
1444	br-d04	2	4	32421	Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus_Christ the unique and the universal concur . 
1445	br-d04	2	5	32438	Perhaps no church_father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as Irenaeus . 
1446	br-d04	2	6	32462	To be the Savior and the Lord , Jesus_Christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own ; he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for_a_while but never identifies itself with man 's history . 
1447	br-d04	2	7	32505	Yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind . 
1448	br-d04	2	8	32522	His history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it . 
1449	br-d04	2	9	32539	His death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus . 
1450	br-d04	2	10	32559	Each man can identify himself with the history and the death of Jesus_Christ because Jesus_Christ has identified himself with human history and human_death , coming as the head of a new humanity . 
1451	br-d04	2	11	32592	Not a circle , then , nor a straight_line , but a spiral represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it ; for a spiral has motion as_well_as recurrence . 
1452	br-d04	2	12	32623	As represented by a spiral , history may , in_some_sense , be said to repeat itself ; yet each historical event remains unique . 
1453	br-d04	2	13	32647	Christ is both unique and universal . 
1454	br-d04	3	14	32654	The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam . 
1455	br-d04	3	15	32669	As Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ . 
1456	br-d04	3	16	32699	`` Whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ? 
1457	br-d04	3	17	32712	From God 's Will and Wisdom , and from virgin earth . 
1458	br-d04	3	18	32724	For ' God had not rained ' , says the Scripture , before man was made , ' and there was no man to till the earth ' . 
1459	br-d04	3	19	32753	From this earth , then , while it was still virgin God took dust and fashioned the man , the beginning of humanity '' . 
1460	br-d04	3	20	32778	Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human_beings , who were and are all_of humanity . 
1461	br-d04	3	21	32802	Adam and Eve were perfect , not in the sense that they possessed perfection , but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection . 
1462	br-d04	3	22	32830	They were , in_fact , children . 
1463	br-d04	3	23	32837	Irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul ; therefore there is no need for him , as there is for Origen , to identify existence itself with the fall . 
1464	br-d04	3	24	32869	Existence is created and willed by God and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history . 
1465	br-d04	3	25	32895	Historical existence is a created good . 
1466	br-d04	4	26	32902	The biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words : `` So God created man in his own image ; in the similitude of God he created him '' . 
1467	br-d04	4	27	32934	There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement : `` If the [ Holy ] Spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature ; and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possessing the image [ of God ] in his formation , but not receiving the similitude [ of God ] through the Spirit '' . 
1468	br-d04	4	28	33023	Thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster ; the similitude of God , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature . 
1469	br-d04	4	29	33066	Recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction . 
1470	br-d04	4	30	33085	He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . 
1471	br-d04	5	31	33126	Therefore Irenaeus describes man 's creation as_follows : 
1472	br-d04	6	32	33134	`` So_that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted_up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all . 
1473	br-d04	6	33	33215	And He laid_down for him certain conditions : so_that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' . 
1474	br-d04	6	34	33269	These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result . 
1475	br-d04	6	35	33293	There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) . 
1476	br-d04	7	36	33340	Man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil 's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality . 
1477	br-d04	7	37	33365	He was , in the words of Irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality '' . 
1478	br-d04	7	38	33385	The true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this . 
1479	br-d04	8	39	33401	`` Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as_yet she was a virgin . 
1480	br-d04	8	40	33418	And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as_yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human_race ; so also did Mary , having a man betrothed [ to her ] , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human_race '' . 
1481	br-d04	8	41	33496	Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no_doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' . 
1482	br-d04	8	42	33545	His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary . 
1483	br-d04	8	43	33571	That parallelism affects his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ , the Word_of_God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word_of_God in_the_beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe . 
1484	br-d04	9	44	33617	With this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality . 
1485	br-d04	9	45	33656	At the nadir of that circuit is death . 
1486	br-d04	9	46	33665	`` Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; and disobedience to God entails death . 
1487	br-d04	9	47	33694	Wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that [ moment ] they were handed_over to it '' . 
1488	br-d04	9	48	33715	This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a Friday , as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good_Friday ; he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath . 
1489	br-d04	9	49	33768	In_any_case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead . 
1490	br-d04	9	50	33788	The wages of sin is death . 
1491	br-d04	9	51	33795	Man 's life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God , must now be conformed_to the shape of death . 
1492	br-d04	10	52	33818	Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules . 
1493	br-d04	10	53	33840	Even death , therefore , has a providential as_well_as a punitive function . 
1494	br-d04	11	54	33853	`` Wherefore also He [ God ] drove him [ man ] out of Paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because He envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable . 
1495	br-d04	11	55	33933	But He set a bound to his [ state of ] sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take_place in the earth , so_that man , ceasing at_length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to God '' . 
1496	br-d04	11	56	33997	This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus ' theology ; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ . 
1497	br-d04	11	57	34039	As man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life . 
1498	br-d04	12	58	34062	It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is . 
1499	br-d04	12	59	34085	This applies to his picture of Adam . 
1500	br-d04	12	60	34093	It is borne_out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next . 
1501	br-d04	12	61	34115	It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality . 
1502	br-d04	12	62	34147	This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek speaking ones . 
1503	br-d04	12	63	34172	They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history . 
1504	br-d04	13	64	34203	Death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience . 
1505	br-d04	13	65	34219	It represents a punishment that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time . 
1506	br-d04	13	66	34246	These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified . 
1507	br-d04	13	67	34265	The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated . 
1508	br-d04	13	68	34292	Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and_then older and_then still older , in_short , whether Adam 's life was intended to be part of the process of time . 
1509	br-d04	13	69	34332	If it was , then it must have been God 's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity . 
1510	br-d04	13	70	34356	One night , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen_asleep , much_as he fell_asleep for the creation of Eve ; and thus he would have been carried_over into the life_eternal . 
1511	br-d04	13	71	34391	The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural_order of time and change . 
1512	br-d04	14	72	34434	On_the_other_hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence . 
1513	br-d04	14	73	34451	It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law . 
1514	br-d04	14	74	34465	If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator . 
1515	br-d04	14	75	34513	This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced . 
1516	br-d04	14	76	34526	If death receives more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through Christ begins to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence . 
1517	br-d04	14	77	34570	Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history . 
1518	br-d04	14	78	34597	Because Christianity teaches not_only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of Christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ . 
1519	br-e01	1	1	34633	Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents do n't want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things '' because `` you 'll stunt your growth '' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` Hey , lookit Mr._America , whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) '' ? 
1520	br-e01	2	2	34703	After_all , a guy 's gotta have a_little ego ! 
1521	br-e01	3	3	34713	Therefore it 's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in_secret ; has never heard one unkind word from his parents ; and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! 
1522	br-e01	4	4	34754	This happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior_Mr._Canada - Henri_de_Courcy . 
1523	br-e01	5	5	34771	Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments . 
1524	br-e01	5	6	34787	Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority , Professor_Roland_Claude . 
1525	br-e01	6	7	34809	And they could n't have entrusted Henri to better hands because `` le_professeur '' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido_mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis_anticus of the leg - and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth . 
1526	br-e01	7	8	34869	That 's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal_Health_Studio which is located at 1821 Mt._Royal_East in Montreal . 
1527	br-e01	7	9	34892	Undoubtedly you have read the case_histories of some of his prize_winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) . 
1528	br-e01	7	10	34918	There 's Gaetan_d'Amours who is our newest Mr._Canada ; Jean-Paul_Senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago ; Jack_Boissoneault , who was with us last month ; Charles_Harve , who recently won the `` Most Muscular Man '' subdivision award in the Mr._Canada event ; and a host of others . 
1529	br-e01	7	11	34970	Yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ! 
1530	br-e01	8	12	34978	Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4 ' 10 '' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack_on some weight . 
1531	br-e01	8	13	35009	About that time he began reading Mr._America and Muscle_Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight_gaining . 
1532	br-e01	8	14	35030	Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein , those two wonder-working Weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him . 
1533	br-e01	9	15	35068	Well , sir , they did real great ! 
1534	br-e01	9	16	35077	For in almost less time than it takes to tell it , Henri 's body weight was increasing rapidly . 
1535	br-e01	9	17	35097	Of_course he did some exercising - he 's crazy about water_skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in_conjunction_with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame . 
1536	br-e01	10	18	35129	Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water_skiing and really does n't have to work them very_much . 
1537	br-e01	10	19	35149	But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body . 
1538	br-e01	10	20	35159	It was muscular but it was n't symmetrical . 
1539	br-e01	10	21	35168	`` A real ' nothing ' torso '' , says Henri . 
1540	br-e01	10	22	35180	`` It never seemed to widen , it just got longer and longer '' . 
1541	br-e01	11	23	35195	That 's when he went_to Professor_Claude . 
1542	br-e01	11	24	35202	And at_once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it . 
1543	br-e01	11	25	35219	In his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked_out '' equipment since Vic_Tanny . 
1544	br-e01	11	26	35236	Mr._Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider_Push-Pull_Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . 
1545	br-e01	12	27	35299	So right_away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull_Super-Set consisting_of the wide grip Straight-Arm_Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull_Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib_cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar Bench_Press which specifically works_on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids . 
1546	br-e01	13	28	35380	As you can see , in this Push-Pull_Super_Set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises , so the complete torso remains pumped-up all_the_time ! 
1547	br-e01	14	29	35412	Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 2 . 
1548	br-e01	15	30	35443	Super-Set No. 2 is made_up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat_benches . 
1549	br-e01	15	31	35468	The `` push '' exercise of this Push-Pull_Super-Set is the Bench_Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation . 
1550	br-e01	15	32	35501	You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs . 
1551	br-e01	15	33	35515	The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the pecs . 
1552	br-e01	16	34	35528	The `` pull '' exercise in this Super-Set is the one dumbbell Bent-Arm_Pullover . 
1553	br-e01	16	35	35542	( Note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin_point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) . 
1554	br-e01	17	36	35571	In the third Push-Pull_Super-Set the `` push '' exercise is the wide grip Pushup_Between_Bars , while the `` pull '' exercise is the Moon_Bench_Lateral_Raise with bent arms . 
1555	br-e01	18	37	35599	The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral rib_cage stretcher ever invented ! 
1556	br-e01	18	38	35614	This is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved . 
1557	br-e01	18	39	35635	You 'll know when you 've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder_blades will touch ! 
1558	br-e01	18	40	35651	As you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a wide grip . 
1559	br-e01	18	41	35673	He has to ; he just can n't do anything about it at_all ! 
1560	br-e01	19	42	35687	But as you can also see , it 's not a painful exercise at_all , because Henri_de_Courcy - the `` happy '' bodybuilder - looks as though he were having the time of his life ! 
1561	br-e01	20	43	35723	The last exercise of Roland_Claude 's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a_bit longer pause between sets . 
1562	br-e01	20	44	35749	By this time Henri 's entire chest back - lat shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point , and Claude takes time to do a_bit more pectoral front deltoid shaping work . 
1563	br-e01	20	45	35782	He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline_Bench_Press ( note the high incline ) . 
1564	br-e01	20	46	35801	This gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and lats . 
1565	br-e01	21	47	35827	This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests that steel edged `` carved out_of solid rock '' looks of the great champions . 
1566	br-e01	22	48	35852	So with four complete Push-Pull_Super-Sets No. 1 , four of No. 2 , four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline_Bench_Press , you can see that Henri_de_Courcy has had a terrific mass building , muscle shaping , torso defining workout that cannot be improved upon . 
1567	br-e01	23	49	35902	Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone . 
1568	br-e01	23	50	35912	Rarer still is a Mr._America or Mr._Universe of true Herculean build . 
1569	br-e01	23	51	35924	The aspects of physical development that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion - superior definition of the muscles . 
1570	br-e01	24	52	35957	Now good definition is one thing that all_of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight workouts . 
1571	br-e01	24	53	35978	But contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor 's chisel - is something quite different . 
1572	br-e01	24	54	36010	This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him . 
1573	br-e01	25	55	36043	Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others . 
1574	br-e01	25	56	36057	Because they are `` minority '' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten . 
1575	br-e01	25	57	36081	Only when the newest Mr._America or Mr._Universe rediscovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once_again see how effective they really are . 
1576	br-e01	26	58	36109	The exercise I shall discuss in this - the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition specialization of a particular body_part - is the One_Leg_Lunge . 
1577	br-e01	26	59	36138	Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no_matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! 
1578	br-e01	27	60	36167	It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline - that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders - a criterion of muscle `` drama '' that_is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike - the facet of muscular development that wins prizes . 
1579	br-e01	28	61	36222	Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable . 
1580	br-e01	28	62	36244	The One_Leg_Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts . 
1581	br-e01	29	63	36259	But for purely definition purposes - used in conjunction with your regular Squatting , Leg_Curling , Leg_Extensor programs - a heavy weight is not needed . 
1582	br-e01	29	64	36285	Indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be_performed . 
1583	br-e01	29	65	36303	Used in several sets of high reps once or twice each_week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes_on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look_like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin ! 
1584	br-e01	30	66	36342	Really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find_its_way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective : 
1585	br-e01	31	67	36373	It 's a complete thigh contraction extension exercise . 
1586	br-e01	32	68	36382	It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from_start_to_finish of each repetition . 
1587	br-e01	33	69	36395	It improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed . 
1588	br-e01	34	70	36417	It increases flexibility of the legs . 
1589	br-e01	35	71	36424	It speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort to be focused_on each . 
1590	br-e01	36	72	36457	You 'll need your Weider_Power_Stands for this fine exercise and here 's the way it 's done : 
1591	br-e01	37	73	36475	Place your Power_Stands in position and adjust their height so_that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean . 
1592	br-e01	38	74	36508	Place a suitably loaded barbell across them ; grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck ) ; extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split . 
1593	br-e01	39	75	36546	Now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet . 
1594	br-e01	39	76	36561	When the front knee is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the Power_Stands . 
1595	br-e01	40	77	36591	After you have taken_a_breather , reverse the position of your legs so_that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner . 
1596	br-e01	41	78	36635	That 's the One-Leg_Lunge in_a_nutshell . 
1597	br-e01	41	79	36641	You should have a_couple_of training partners to stand_by when you make your first experiments , just for safety . 
1598	br-e01	41	80	36660	You should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance_wise . 
1599	br-e01	42	81	36679	Oh , you 'll wobble and weave quite a_bit at_first . 
1600	br-e01	42	82	36690	But do n't worry . 
1601	br-e01	42	83	36695	Before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you 'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran ! 
1602	br-e01	43	84	36726	Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there 's no reason why you should n't make some experiments with the bar held in_front_of the neck . 
1603	br-e01	43	85	36759	Squat_style lifters and leg split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front . 
1604	br-e02	1	1	36791	The most beautiful bed of pansies I 've seen was in a South_Dakota yard on a sizzling day . 
1605	br-e02	1	2	36810	Pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun . 
1606	br-e02	1	3	36832	I sought_out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather . 
1607	br-e02	1	4	36850	He seemed puzzled by my question . 
1608	br-e02	1	5	36857	`` I just love them '' , he said . 
1609	br-e02	2	6	36867	The more I talked with him , the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming . 
1610	br-e02	2	7	36889	Of_course his love was expressed in intelligent care . 
1611	br-e02	2	8	36898	He planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist . 
1612	br-e02	2	9	36912	These specialists , I learned , have done a great_deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers . 
1613	br-e02	2	10	36938	Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains . 
1614	br-e02	3	11	36953	I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants . 
1615	br-e02	3	12	36965	Occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did ; but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run_down '' . 
1616	br-e02	3	13	36994	It 's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them . 
1617	br-e02	4	14	37011	His soil was `` nothing special '' , just prairie land , but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose , spongy and brown black . 
1618	br-e02	4	15	37039	I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes_with the right texture , tilth and body . 
1619	br-e02	4	16	37058	It is n't easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil . 
1620	br-e02	5	17	37078	Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies . 
1621	br-e02	5	18	37088	They germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily . 
1622	br-e02	5	19	37105	It does n't really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours . 
1623	br-e02	6	20	37143	I like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold_frames . 
1624	br-e02	6	21	37163	Pansies do n't have to be coddled ; they 'd rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days . 
1625	br-e02	6	22	37187	If you do use a cold_frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate . 
1626	br-e02	7	23	37201	For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting . 
1627	br-e02	7	24	37218	I dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray . 
1628	br-e02	7	25	37238	Then I cover the sowing with a board . 
1629	br-e02	7	26	37247	This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds . 
1630	br-e02	7	27	37259	Ants carry_away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby . 
1631	br-e02	8	28	37275	When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board . 
1632	br-e02	8	29	37287	A light , porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth . 
1633	br-e02	8	30	37309	I like sawdust for this , or hay . 
1634	br-e02	9	31	37318	When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it 's time to set them out where they are to remain . 
1635	br-e02	9	32	37344	Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller . 
1636	br-e02	9	33	37358	The moral is : do n't transplant it any oftener than you must . 
1637	br-e02	9	34	37372	As_soon_as they are large enough to move , I put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom . 
1638	br-e02	9	35	37392	I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone_meal into each hole with the plant . 
1639	br-e02	9	36	37411	That encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers . 
1640	br-e02	10	37	37430	Pansies are gluttons . 
1641	br-e02	10	38	37434	I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them . 
1642	br-e02	10	39	37444	I spade lots of compost into their bed ; lacking that , decayed manure spread_over the bed is fine . 
1643	br-e02	10	40	37464	One year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a_little sand had been added , and I had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors ' experience . 
1644	br-e02	10	41	37505	In_addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every_other week , diluted to the color of weak tea . 
1645	br-e02	10	42	37528	As a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used . 
1646	br-e02	11	43	37551	They need mulch . 
1647	br-e02	11	44	37555	We put a light mulch over the seedlings ; now we must use a heavy one . 
1648	br-e02	11	45	37572	Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool . 
1649	br-e02	12	46	37593	When winter comes be ready with additional mulch . 
1650	br-e02	12	47	37602	I like hay for this and apply it so_that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost . 
1651	br-e02	12	48	37624	That keeps_in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing . 
1652	br-e02	13	49	37641	Do n't miss the pansies that appear from_time_to_time through the winter . 
1653	br-e02	13	50	37653	Whenever there is a thaw or a_few sunny days , you 'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two . 
1654	br-e02	13	51	37676	If those are n't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? 
1655	br-e02	13	52	37693	The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter . 
1656	br-e02	13	53	37709	I started the seed in a flat in June and set_out the little pansies in a cold_frame . 
1657	br-e02	13	54	37727	( An unheated greenhouse would have been better , if I had had one . ) 
1658	br-e02	13	55	37743	The plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them . 
1659	br-e02	13	56	37766	In response to the lengthening days of February they budded , then bloomed their 4 - inch velvety flowers . 
1660	br-e02	13	57	37786	That cold_frame was my morale_builder ; its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it . 
1661	br-e02	13	58	37814	Like strawberries in December , pansies are far more exciting in February than in May . 
1662	br-e02	13	59	37830	Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired_of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it . 
1663	br-e02	14	60	37855	The day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming `` leggy '' , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms . 
1664	br-e02	14	61	37883	Try pegging_down each separate branch to the earth , using a bobby_pin to hold it there . 
1665	br-e02	14	62	37900	Pick the flowers , keep the soil dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go_on blooming for the rest of the season . 
1666	br-e02	14	63	37933	As_soon_as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken_over , cut it off from the mother plant . 
1667	br-e02	15	64	37952	A second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch . 
1668	br-e02	15	65	37980	These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring . 
1669	br-e02	15	66	38001	I like to shear half my plants at_a_time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second_half is getting_started on its new round of blooming . 
1670	br-e02	16	67	38029	Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed . 
1671	br-e02	16	68	38052	Nature 's aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation . 
1672	br-e02	16	69	38068	That done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant . 
1673	br-e02	17	70	38081	Here is a word_of_advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds . 
1674	br-e02	17	71	38094	Go_to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist . 
1675	br-e02	17	72	38104	It is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things ; in_fact it is easier . 
1676	br-e02	17	73	38128	But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow . 
1677	br-e02	18	74	38141	Many people think that pansies last only a_few weeks , then their period of growth and bloom is over . 
1678	br-e02	18	75	38161	That is not true . 
1679	br-e02	18	76	38166	If the plants are cared for and protected over the winter , the second year is more prolific than the first . 
1680	br-e02	19	77	38188	Would you like to grow exhibition pansies ? 
1681	br-e02	19	78	38196	Remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds . 
1682	br-e02	19	79	38214	The flowers will be huge . 
1683	br-e02	20	80	38220	Pansies have character . 
1684	br-e02	20	81	38224	They stick_to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it . 
1685	br-e02	20	82	38245	Treat them right and they 'll make a showing every_month in the year except the frigid ones . 
1686	br-e02	20	83	38263	Give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they 'll repay your solicitude with beauty . 
1687	br-e02	21	84	38286	A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special . 
1688	br-e02	21	85	38314	This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocado anywhere in the United_States . 
1689	br-e02	21	86	38342	It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you have n't made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should . 
1690	br-e02	22	87	38369	You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted . 
1691	br-e02	22	88	38384	It is roughly shaped like a large pear , and when properly ripened , its dark green skin covers a meaty , melon like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe Bartlett_pear , but oily . 
1692	br-e02	22	89	38422	The avocado should have a `` give '' to it , as you hold it , when it is ripe . 
1693	br-e02	22	90	38443	The flavor is neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange ; it is subtle and rather bland , nut like . 
1694	br-e02	22	91	38469	It is a flavor that might take a_little getting used_to - not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits . 
1695	br-e02	22	92	38504	Sometimes it takes several `` eatings '' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world . 
1696	br-e02	22	93	38531	Once you become an avocado fan , you will look_forward to the season each_year with eager anticipation . 
1697	br-e02	23	94	38549	Today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world . 
1698	br-e02	23	95	38567	The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point . 
1699	br-e02	23	96	38586	It is brought to packing_houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior . 
1700	br-e02	23	97	38607	The fruit is then cooled to 42 ` F. , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort_of dormant state . 
1701	br-e02	23	98	38629	This cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grove like temperature ( room_temperature ) is restored . 
1702	br-e02	23	99	38660	This happens on the grocer 's shelf or in your kitchen . 
1703	br-e02	24	100	38672	One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind . 
1704	br-e02	24	101	38691	There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed . 
1705	br-e02	24	102	38701	If the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed . 
1706	br-e02	24	103	38717	And unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado . 
1707	br-e02	24	104	38731	It is thick , much like an egg_plant 's skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer . 
1708	br-e02	25	105	38759	Good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited . 
1709	br-e02	25	106	38790	Avocados , however , are very rich_in nutrients . 
1710	br-e02	25	107	38799	Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty_acids , so necessary for maintaining the good_health of the circulatory_system . 
1711	br-e02	25	108	38819	Aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins and C - about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin_E requirement . 
1712	br-e02	25	109	38856	The B_vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin . 
1713	br-e02	25	110	38867	Calcium , phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts . 
1714	br-e02	25	111	38891	None of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage . 
1715	br-e02	26	112	38905	Dr._Wilson_C._Grant , of the Veterans_'_Administration_Hospital , Coral_Gables , Florida , and the University_of_Miami_School_of_Medicine , set_out to discover if avocados , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty_acids , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients . 
1716	br-e02	26	113	38945	The study comprised 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to 72 . 
1717	br-e02	26	114	38960	They were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood . 
1718	br-e02	26	115	38981	Then they were given 1_2 to 1 - 1_2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption . 
1719	br-e04	1	1	39004	The lyric beauties of Schubert 's Trout_Quintet - its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies - make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners . 
1720	br-e04	1	2	39032	But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems . 
1721	br-e04	1	3	39048	Since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall_into the category of chamber_music - yet it calls_for a double_bass , an instrument generally regarded_as symphonic . 
1722	br-e04	1	4	39077	Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather_than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . 
1723	br-e04	2	5	39106	The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . 
1724	br-e04	2	6	39124	Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free_rein . 
1725	br-e04	2	7	39137	Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation . 
1726	br-e04	2	8	39148	In these readings , the double_bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown 's attire - the musical equivalent of a bull_in_a_china_shop . 
1727	br-e04	2	9	39178	Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances . 
1728	br-e04	2	10	39207	The occasion for this marathon : Angel 's long awaited reissue in its `` Great_Recordings_of_the_Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro_Arte version . 
1729	br-e04	2	11	39229	Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . 
1730	br-e04	3	12	39252	Whether considered alone or in_relation_to other editions , COLH 40 is a document of prime importance . 
1731	br-e04	3	13	39269	Artur_Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable . 
1732	br-e04	3	14	39290	But Schnabel was a great teacher in_addition_to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford_Curzon , Frank_Glazer , Adrian_Aeschbacher , and Victor_Babin ) also sheds_light_on the master 's pedagogical skills . 
1733	br-e04	3	15	39336	Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in_that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) . 
1734	br-e04	3	16	39370	But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel 's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student 's approach as distinctly his own . 
1735	br-e04	4	17	39398	Schnabel 's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one . 
1736	br-e04	4	18	39424	Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . 
1737	br-e04	4	19	39453	This is a serious minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced . 
1738	br-e04	4	20	39466	And although Schnabel 's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert 's dynamic markings and phrase indications . 
1739	br-e04	4	21	39488	The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives . 
1740	br-e04	5	22	39504	About the Pro_Arte 's contribution I am less happy . 
1741	br-e04	5	23	39514	I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel did n't collaborate with the Budapest_Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good_deal closer to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group . 
1742	br-e04	5	24	39553	From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro_Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here . 
1743	br-e04	5	25	39578	The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy . 
1744	br-e04	5	26	39600	The twenty-five year old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . 
1745	br-e04	5	27	39626	There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is_due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs . 
1746	br-e04	6	28	39660	Turning_to the more modern versions , Curzon 's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work . 
1747	br-e04	6	29	39678	Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought_out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout . 
1748	br-e04	6	30	39725	Some of Curzon 's playing strikes me as finicky , however . 
1749	br-e04	6	31	39737	Why , for_example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ? 
1750	br-e04	6	32	39756	The assisting musicians from the Vienna_Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing . 
1751	br-e04	6	33	39776	( Special compliments to the double_bass playing of Johann_Krumpp : 
1752	br-e04	6	34	39786	his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance . ) 
1753	br-e04	7	35	39800	The Glazer-Fine_Arts edition ( Concert-Disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization . 
1754	br-e04	7	36	39814	It is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort . 
1755	br-e04	7	37	39825	But having lived with the disc for some time now , I find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel 's or Fleisher 's ( whose superb performance with the Budapest_Quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good_deal less filled with humor than Curzon 's . 
1756	br-e04	7	38	39873	Aeschbacher 's work is very_much akin to Schnabel 's , but the sound on his Decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard_time locating a copy of it . 
1757	br-e04	8	39	39905	The Hephzibah_Menuhin-Amadeus_Quartet ( Angel ) and Victor_Babin-Festival_Quartet ( RCA_Victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing . 
1758	br-e04	8	40	39933	( Babin has acquired some of Schnabel 's keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight . ) 
1759	br-e04	8	41	39953	Badura-Skoda-Vienna_Konzerthaus ( Westminster ) and Demus-Schubert_Quartet ( Deutsche_Grammophon ) are both warm_toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless . 
1760	br-e04	8	42	39975	Helmut_Roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth_Ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last_mentioned pianists . 
1761	br-e04	8	43	40004	Telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sells for $ 2.98 ) is worthy of consideration . 
1762	br-e04	9	44	40027	Returning once_again to the Schnabel reissue , I am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist 's musical penetration . 
1763	br-e04	9	45	40048	Here is truly a `` Great Recording of the Century '' , and its greatness is by_no_means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect . 
1764	br-e04	9	46	40076	This recording surely belongs in everyone 's collection . 
1765	br-e04	9	47	40085	Must records always sound like records ? 
1766	br-e04	10	48	40092	From the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real_Thing have regularly been put in circulation . 
1767	br-e04	10	49	40115	Seen in perspective , many_of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones . 
1768	br-e04	10	50	40130	Although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original . 
1769	br-e04	10	51	40152	On the basis of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl_Muck 's baton , or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New_York_Philharmonic . 
1770	br-e04	11	52	40195	Since the concept of high_fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold . 
1771	br-e04	11	53	40216	In many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects : 
1772	br-e04	11	54	40230	the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer . 
1773	br-e04	11	55	40249	Other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in_time the status of classics . 
1774	br-e04	11	56	40267	If we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing . 
1775	br-e04	12	57	40288	Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music . 
1776	br-e04	12	58	40304	This difference is made_up of many factors . 
1777	br-e04	12	59	40312	Some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings . 
1778	br-e04	12	60	40343	( Music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat . ) 
1779	br-e04	12	61	40367	From the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original . 
1780	br-e04	12	62	40405	Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests . 
1781	br-e04	12	63	40439	Yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records . 
1782	br-e04	12	64	40470	The sound may be good ; but if you know The Real_Thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation . 
1783	br-e04	13	65	40496	Command 's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one . 
1784	br-e04	13	66	40522	Like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High_Fidelity , Sept. 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather_than on creating sensational effects . 
1785	br-e04	13	67	40555	Because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers ' triumph . 
1786	br-e04	14	68	40579	The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values . 
1787	br-e04	14	69	40606	The engineering as_such never obtrudes_upon your consciousness . 
1788	br-e04	14	70	40614	The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance . 
1789	br-e04	14	71	40639	This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not_only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue . 
1790	br-e04	14	72	40658	A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained . 
1791	br-e04	14	73	40673	The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental_to playing . 
1792	br-e04	14	74	40697	Yet you feel the orchestra is near at_hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall . 
1793	br-e04	14	75	40728	Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation . 
1794	br-e04	14	76	40737	The music is always allowed the living_space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer . 
1795	br-e04	14	77	40761	The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance . 
1796	br-e04	15	78	40772	All_of this would be wasted , of_course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction . 
1797	br-e04	15	79	40789	For me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors . 
1798	br-e04	15	80	40804	Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set_down on_paper . 
1799	br-e04	16	81	40838	Those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one . 
1800	br-e04	16	82	40861	Without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm , the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly_knit quality that makes_for maximum cumulative effect . 
1801	br-e04	16	83	40888	The Presto ma_non_assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real Allegro_con_spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet . 
1802	br-e04	16	84	40922	In_the_end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings . 
1803	br-e04	16	85	40941	Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at_times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song . 
1804	br-e04	17	86	40974	The engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result . 
1805	br-e04	17	87	40986	Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment . 
1806	br-e04	17	88	41004	The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration . 
1807	br-e04	17	89	41018	Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score . 
1808	br-e04	17	90	41044	It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high_fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener . 
1809	br-e04	17	91	41066	The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer 's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment . 
1810	br-e04	17	92	41108	The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari 's melodramatic contrasts between ultra vehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality . 
1811	br-e04	17	93	41138	And in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super high_fidelity '' . 
1812	br-e04	17	94	41169	The home listener is overpowered , all_right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one . 
1813	br-e04	17	95	41187	As with the penultimate Giselle release ( Wolff 's abridgment for RCA_Victor ) I find the cleaner , less razor edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable - but this may be the result of processing defects in my SD copies . 
1814	br-e21	1	1	41239	Most recreation work calls_for a good_deal of pre planning . 
1815	br-e21	1	2	41249	This is particularly true in site selection . 
1816	br-e21	1	3	41257	You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed . 
1817	br-e21	1	4	41293	With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available . 
1818	br-e21	2	5	41308	Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible . 
1819	br-e21	2	6	41324	These are becoming more_and_more available through the work of counties and other government agencies . 
1820	br-e21	2	7	41339	The new_editions of topographic maps being made by the federal_government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site . 
1821	br-e21	2	8	41362	These are inexpensive and available from the U._S._Geological_Society , washington 25 , D._C. . 
1822	br-e21	2	9	41376	In recent years many counties and the U._S._Forest_Service have taken aerial photos which show features in_detail and are very good for planning use . 
1823	br-e21	2	10	41400	Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor 's office showing ownerships of land . 
1824	br-e21	3	11	41426	Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation . 
1825	br-e21	3	12	41449	This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons . 
1826	br-e21	3	13	41485	It is usually helpful to make a sketch_map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site . 
1827	br-e21	3	14	41515	These are a great aid for planning use back at the office . 
1828	br-e21	4	15	41528	For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study . 
1829	br-e21	4	16	41549	However , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation . 
1830	br-e21	4	17	41576	County judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and_others who have lived in the area for a long_time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences . 
1831	br-e21	4	18	41612	A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring_out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area . 
1832	br-e21	5	19	41642	How much study is required ? 
1833	br-e21	5	20	41648	This , of_course , depends_on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive_at a good decision . 
1834	br-e21	5	21	41679	It is too easy for the inexperienced_person to make a quick judgment of a_few values of the area and base a decision on these alone . 
1835	br-e21	5	22	41705	Usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions . 
1836	br-e21	5	23	41718	A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a_little development or water . 
1837	br-e21	5	24	41747	The same is true of areas which at_first look good because of a_few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use . 
1838	br-e21	6	25	41776	In looking_for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others . 
1839	br-e21	6	26	41797	You need answers to four important questions . 
1840	br-e21	7	27	41805	What are the existing recreation features ? 
1841	br-e21	8	28	41812	How well can the site be developed ? 
1842	br-e21	9	29	41820	How useful will it be to the public ? 
1843	br-e21	10	30	41829	Is this site available ? 
1844	br-e21	11	31	41834	Check the quantity and quality of all_of the recreation interests already existing at the site . 
1845	br-e21	11	32	41850	Naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand_dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes . 
1846	br-e21	11	33	41882	Quality is vitally important . 
1847	br-e21	11	34	41887	Frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water . 
1848	br-e21	11	35	41910	Some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests . 
1849	br-e21	12	36	41931	One of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery . 
1850	br-e21	12	37	41946	It may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees . 
1851	br-e21	12	38	41974	A site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic . 
1852	br-e21	12	39	41992	An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach . 
1853	br-e21	12	40	42010	A site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs . 
1854	br-e21	12	41	42026	Note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy . 
1855	br-e21	13	42	42043	Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site . 
1856	br-e21	13	43	42060	Most park planners look_to water frontage for basic park areas . 
1857	br-e21	13	44	42071	This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water_sports . 
1858	br-e21	13	45	42106	A body_of_water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use . 
1859	br-e21	13	46	42125	It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wildlife . 
1860	br-e21	14	47	42139	The amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important . 
1861	br-e21	14	48	42162	A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use . 
1862	br-e21	14	49	42175	The quantity of water flow may be critical ; a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer . 
1863	br-e21	14	50	42203	If the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied . 
1864	br-e21	14	51	42227	Check the quality of the water . 
1865	br-e21	14	52	42234	A stream which has all_of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing_through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area . 
1866	br-e21	14	53	42271	Other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value . 
1867	br-e21	15	54	42302	Other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand_dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed . 
1868	br-e21	15	55	42339	Just_as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek_out these features which are distinctive of their area . 
1869	br-e21	15	56	42369	Although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site . 
1870	br-e21	15	57	42393	The route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them . 
1871	br-e21	15	58	42409	A group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site . 
1872	br-e21	16	59	42430	The fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest . 
1873	br-e21	16	60	42448	Fishing interest calls_for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission . 
1874	br-e21	16	61	42477	Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas . 
1875	br-e21	16	62	42491	The site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life . 
1876	br-e21	16	63	42512	Clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas . 
1877	br-e21	17	64	42527	Each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done . 
1878	br-e21	17	65	42541	Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in . 
1879	br-e21	17	66	42556	The historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered . 
1880	br-e21	17	67	42590	Notice should be taken_of unusual rock formations , deposits , or shapes of the earth 's crust in your region . 
1881	br-e21	17	68	42611	Those which tell a story of the earth 's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites . 
1882	br-e21	17	69	42633	An old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest . 
1883	br-e21	17	70	42668	Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera . 
1884	br-e21	18	71	42690	How well can the site be developed ? 
1885	br-e21	18	72	42698	Look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in_comparison_to other sites . 
1886	br-e21	18	73	42740	Many things need to be checked . 
1887	br-e21	19	74	42747	The size of the area alone can be a determining_factor . 
1888	br-e21	19	75	42758	An area may be too small for the needs of the project . 
1889	br-e21	19	76	42771	Areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments . 
1890	br-e21	19	77	42810	Acreage in_excess_of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones . 
1891	br-e21	20	78	42843	Shape of the area is also related_to the use attractions and needs of the development . 
1892	br-e21	20	79	42859	A large picnic_area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in_width in_preference_to a long narrow area less_than one_hundred feet wide . 
1893	br-e21	20	80	42889	This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions . 
1894	br-e21	20	81	42913	However , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman 's trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit . 
1895	br-e21	21	82	42947	The values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there . 
1896	br-e21	21	83	42976	For_instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might_not . 
1897	br-e21	21	84	43010	The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site . 
1898	br-e21	22	85	43030	- Topography is very important . 
1899	br-e21	22	86	43036	Check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock_outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as_well_as subsoil . 
1900	br-e21	22	87	43061	Nearly level areas are required for parking_areas , beaches , camp areas , ball_fields , etcetera . 
1901	br-e21	22	88	43078	Determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be . 
1902	br-e21	23	89	43097	- In_addition_to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation . 
1903	br-e21	23	90	43114	The quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection . 
1904	br-e21	23	91	43130	The area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water_lines . 
1905	br-e21	23	92	43148	Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas . 
1906	br-e21	24	93	43159	- The existing plant growth calls_for thorough checking . 
1907	br-e21	24	94	43168	Look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire hazards , wind throw , etcetera . 
1908	br-e21	25	95	43203	An area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean_up . 
1909	br-e21	25	96	43218	Some shrubs may be of good landscaping value , other areas of brush may need to be cleared . 
1910	br-e21	25	97	43237	The extent and location of open areas is noted . 
1911	br-e21	26	98	43247	- How much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? 
1912	br-e21	26	99	43263	An area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use . 
1913	br-e21	26	100	43277	The direction , velocity , and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area . 
1914	br-e21	26	101	43309	Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call_for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable . 
1915	br-e21	26	102	43331	Sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most_desirable for the use intended . 
1916	br-e21	27	103	43367	- Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site . 
1917	br-e24	1	1	43396	The Russian gymnasts beat_the_tar_out_of the American gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason - they were better . 
1918	br-e24	1	2	43415	They were better trained , better_looking , better built , better disciplined - and something else - they were better dancers . 
1919	br-e24	1	3	43437	Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance . 
1920	br-e24	1	4	43451	The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics . 
1921	br-e24	2	5	43465	But why gymnastics at_all ? 
1922	br-e24	2	6	43470	And is the sport really important ? 
1923	br-e24	2	7	43477	After_all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition . 
1924	br-e24	2	8	43492	But if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? 
1925	br-e24	2	9	43506	It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics . 
1926	br-e24	3	10	43540	Taking first things first , let 's understand the sport called gymnastics . 
1927	br-e24	3	11	43553	It is made_up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run_through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work . 
1928	br-e24	3	12	43596	The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was in_favor_of games . 
1929	br-e24	3	13	43618	The parallel_bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal_bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football . 
1930	br-e24	4	14	43649	But the Russians use gymnastics as the first_step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance . 
1931	br-e24	4	15	43676	The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection . 
1932	br-e24	4	16	43701	In short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great_deal of character as_well . 
1933	br-e24	4	17	43719	The addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen . 
1934	br-e24	5	18	43755	Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life . 
1935	br-e24	5	19	43772	( An enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days . 
1936	br-e24	5	20	43791	Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries . ) 
1937	br-e24	5	21	43802	In most sports , as in most walks_of_life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the Russian competitor of 16 has at_least thirteen years of training behind him . 
1938	br-e24	5	22	43838	The American is very lucky if he has three . 
1939	br-e24	6	23	43848	If a nation wished to get a head_start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large_number of the problems that plague American schools . 
1940	br-e24	6	24	43892	First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both . 
1941	br-e24	6	25	43909	Oddly_enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty . 
1942	br-e24	6	26	43922	Certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better . 
1943	br-e24	6	27	43955	Russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team . 
1944	br-e24	6	28	43978	Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try_for the team itself . 
1945	br-e24	6	29	43992	We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people . 
1946	br-e24	7	30	44007	And what has dancing to do with all this ? 
1947	br-e24	7	31	44017	A great_deal . 
1948	br-e24	7	32	44020	Russia 's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus . 
1949	br-e24	7	33	44035	Well stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic contest . 
1950	br-e24	7	34	44070	American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons . 
1951	br-e24	7	35	44079	They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace . 
1952	br-e24	7	36	44092	They were further stripped of old_wives'_tales by seeing the slender , lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength - and with not one bulging muscle . 
1953	br-e24	8	37	44119	President_Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation . 
1954	br-e24	8	38	44130	If we wait until children are in junior_high or high_school , we will never manage it . 
1955	br-e24	8	39	44147	To be fit , one has_to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance . 
1956	br-e24	8	40	44175	If the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some_day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that_much ahead . 
1957	br-e24	8	41	44210	School_teachers , all_too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators . 
1958	br-e24	8	42	44225	There should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it . 
1959	br-e24	8	43	44247	They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught . 
1960	br-e24	9	44	44267	Dance teachers can respond to President_Kennedy 's request not_only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes_for strength and flexibility . 
1961	br-e24	10	45	44297	Very little in today 's living provides the strength we need , and nothing provides the flexibility . 
1962	br-e24	10	46	44315	Dancers do have flexibility . 
1963	br-e24	10	47	44320	They often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength . 
1964	br-e24	10	48	44340	Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing . 
1965	br-e24	10	49	44371	Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas . 
1966	br-e24	10	50	44382	This is n't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11 - year old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school_girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) . 
1967	br-e24	10	51	44424	The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw . 
1968	br-e24	11	52	44439	For arm and shoulder strength a chinning_bar is recommended . 
1969	br-e24	11	53	44449	It should be installed over a door that is in_full_view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a_little to one side . 
1970	br-e24	11	54	44476	Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin_up each time they pass under it . 
1971	br-e24	11	55	44496	Those who are too weak , should climb_on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down . 
1972	br-e24	11	56	44521	When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin_up . 
1973	br-e24	11	57	44540	Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home . 
1974	br-e24	12	58	44560	Arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the Horse_Kick . 
1975	br-e24	12	59	44578	Start on hands and feet . 
1976	br-e24	12	60	44584	Keeping the hands in the starting position , run in_place to a quick rhythm . 
1977	br-e24	12	61	44599	After this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher . 
1978	br-e24	12	62	44616	Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on_all_fours , kicking as high as possible . 
1979	br-e24	13	63	44637	Push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at_first . 
1980	br-e24	13	64	44650	Start on the knees in a large circle . 
1981	br-e24	13	65	44659	Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest_on the floor . 
1982	br-e24	13	66	44675	Push back up and repeat . 
1983	br-e24	13	67	44681	Do this exercise six times each class period . 
1984	br-e24	13	68	44690	As strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward . 
1985	br-e24	13	69	44708	Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out . 
1986	br-e24	13	70	44732	Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands . 
1987	br-e24	13	71	44752	The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide . 
1988	br-e24	13	72	44771	Let the body down slowly , taking at_least five seconds for the letting_down . 
1989	br-e24	13	73	44785	Five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up . 
1990	br-e24	14	74	44802	Handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at_least a minimum of strength . 
1991	br-e24	14	75	44818	Of_course those who have developed more will find them easier . 
1992	br-e24	14	76	44829	Start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a_little way into the circle . 
1993	br-e24	14	77	44854	At_first each child should do a kick_up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help . 
1994	br-e24	14	78	44881	Drop both hands to the floor and at_the_same_time kick the right foot up in back . 
1995	br-e24	14	79	44897	The left will follow at_once . 
1996	br-e24	14	80	44903	The right will land first , followed by the left . 
1997	br-e24	14	81	44914	Return to the standing position . 
1998	br-e24	14	82	44920	Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible . 
1999	br-e24	14	83	44954	This will prevent flat falls and toe injuries . 
2000	br-e24	14	84	44963	Bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper . 
2001	br-e24	14	85	44976	Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so_that the teacher can catch the leading leg . 
2002	br-e24	14	86	44996	The child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles . 
2003	br-e24	14	87	45015	Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at_a_time . 
2004	br-e24	15	88	45035	The backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results . 
2005	br-e24	15	89	45063	Have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent . 
2006	br-e24	15	90	45074	Place flat palms on either side of the head a_few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders . 
2007	br-e24	15	91	45096	Arch the back upwards to make a bridge . 
2008	br-e24	15	92	45105	Be sure the head drops backward so_that the child looks at the floor rather_than toward the ceiling . 
2009	br-e24	15	93	45123	As flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher . 
2010	br-e24	15	94	45141	Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover . 
2011	br-e24	16	95	45154	To further increase back flexibility , work_on the back_circle . 
2012	br-e24	16	96	45164	Have the class lie prone . 
2013	br-e24	16	97	45170	Place the hands in_front_of the chest . 
2014	br-e24	16	98	45177	Keep the legs straight and the toes pointed . 
2015	br-e24	16	99	45186	Straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back . 
2016	br-e24	16	100	45196	At the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head . 
2017	br-e24	16	101	45220	Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head . 
2018	br-e24	17	102	45233	The last essential to the beginner 's gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll . 
2019	br-e24	17	103	45250	This used_to be part of every child 's bag_of_tricks , but few children can do it today ; some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright . 
2020	br-e24	17	104	45286	For most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can . 
2021	br-e24	17	105	45306	After it has been seen , have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin , inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) . 
2022	br-e24	17	106	45341	He places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest . 
2023	br-e24	17	107	45360	He then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over . 
2024	br-e24	17	108	45375	One or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo . 
2025	br-e24	17	109	45386	If , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed . 
2026	br-e24	17	110	45406	When the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes_hold under both sides of the pelvis ; then no_matter_what_happens , the child 's performance will be controlled . 
2027	br-e24	17	111	45437	By lifting the seat upwards a_little , the weight is taken_off the neck and the back is kept rounded . 
2028	br-e24	18	112	45457	These are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) . 
2029	br-e24	18	113	45491	Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human_being with a greater margin of safety in any activity . 
2030	br-e24	19	114	45526	It is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative . 
2031	br-e24	19	115	45540	And dancing_school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training - and can contribute even more . 
2032	br-e29	1	1	45565	The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior_designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference_of_opinion . 
2033	br-e29	1	2	45593	The architects do not believe that the education of the interior_designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . 
2034	br-e29	2	3	45640	Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round_tables , workshops or panel_discussions - whatever they are called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled_down crux_of_the_matter is education . 
2035	br-e29	3	4	45693	It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . 
2036	br-e29	3	5	45712	The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . 
2037	br-e29	3	6	45735	This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior_designer 's training . 
2038	br-e29	4	7	45754	We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior_design student as not having serious bearing on the subject . 
2039	br-e29	4	8	45783	The real question that follows is - how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? 
2040	br-e29	5	9	45804	The American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . 
2041	br-e29	5	10	45822	An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior_design , for_the_most_part schools accredited by membership in the National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art , and a further `` on_the_spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations . 
2042	br-e29	5	11	45867	One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions . 
2043	br-e29	6	12	45906	The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities . 
2044	br-e29	6	13	45931	Obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated . 
2045	br-e29	7	14	45949	Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses - architecture versus interior_design - let us examine the educational needs of the interior_designer . 
2046	br-e29	8	15	45973	To_begin_with , what is an interior_designer ? 
2047	br-e29	8	16	45980	`` The_Dictionary_of_Occupational_Titles '' published by the U._S. Department_of_Labor describes him as_follows : 
2048	br-e29	8	17	45992	`` Designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as_well_as set_decorations for motion_picture arts and television . 
2049	br-e29	8	18	46023	Makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor_coverings , wall decorations , and determines color_schemes . 
2050	br-e29	9	19	46043	Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval . 
2051	br-e29	9	20	46051	Makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows_through to completion of project `` . 
2052	br-e29	10	21	46083	In_addition to this the U._S. Civil_Service_Bureau , when examining applicants for government positions as interior_designers , expects that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them . 
2053	br-e29	10	22	46117	He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings '' . 
2054	br-e29	11	23	46138	This seems like a large_order . 
2055	br-e29	11	24	46144	The interior_designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance . 
2056	br-e29	11	25	46167	Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior_designer does know all this and does practice it . 
2057	br-e29	11	26	46189	And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not_only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society . 
2058	br-e29	12	27	46223	Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum . 
2059	br-e29	12	28	46240	It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise . 
2060	br-e29	13	29	46257	The old established independent art_schools try their best to fulfill their obligations . 
2061	br-e29	13	30	46270	Yet even here many_a problem is presented ; as in a recent design competition with a floor_plan and the simple command - `` design a luxury apartment '' ; no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical_area or local social necessities - simply `` a luxury apartment '' . 
2062	br-e29	13	31	46325	Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show_pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public_relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior_design . 
2063	br-e29	14	32	46361	It is possible , of_course , to work_on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so_that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior_design demands . 
2064	br-e29	14	33	46396	Unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule . 
2065	br-e29	15	34	46406	It is like medical_schools in India where , in that fairy_land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead_bodies is frowned_upon . 
2066	br-e29	15	35	46428	Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants . 
2067	br-e29	15	36	46439	Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience . 
2068	br-e29	16	37	46451	In the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use . 
2069	br-e29	16	38	46473	But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable . 
2070	br-e29	17	39	46485	Consultation with architects , clients , real_estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work . 
2071	br-e29	17	40	46514	Fortunately , although only a_few years ago they held the student at_arms_length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not_only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior_designer of tomorrow - that the student already is `` in the trade '' . 
2072	br-e29	18	41	46574	Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern_slides . 
2073	br-e29	18	42	46591	Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced . 
2074	br-e29	19	43	46604	The professional organizations such_as American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers , National_Society_of_Interior_Designers , Home_Fashions_League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work . 
2075	br-e29	19	44	46627	Certainly every educator involved in interior_design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations . 
2076	br-e29	20	45	46648	Not_only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent_to certification to teach the subject . 
2077	br-e29	21	46	46695	Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have_to be raised to full and complete membership . 
2078	br-e29	21	47	46715	The largest of these organizations at_present denies to the full_time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog . 
2079	br-e29	22	48	46758	This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students . 
2080	br-e29	22	49	46777	The professor in_turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice . 
2081	br-e29	23	50	46803	This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands . 
2082	br-e29	24	51	46837	In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools . 
2083	br-e29	24	52	46851	That_is in the continuance of the `` grandfather_clauses '' in their membership requirements . 
2084	br-e29	25	53	46865	When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior_design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth . 
2085	br-e29	25	54	46896	Long hard years of `` on_the_job '' training had brought them to their competence . 
2086	br-e29	26	55	46911	The necessity of that day has long disappeared . 
2087	br-e29	26	56	46920	There is plenty of opportunity for proper education today . 
2088	br-e29	26	57	46930	It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand . 
2089	br-e29	27	58	46954	The reason and the day of `` grandfather_clauses '' has long_since passed . 
2090	br-e29	27	59	46967	No one can deny that these `` back_door '' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies . 
2091	br-e29	28	60	47003	Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves . 
2092	br-e29	28	61	47021	It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students . 
2093	br-e29	28	62	47059	The local decorator who rushes in for a_few hours of teaching may but more likely may_not have these qualifications . 
2094	br-e29	29	63	47079	Nor will the hack , the Jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art_schools , suffice . 
2095	br-e29	30	64	47098	Only a_few years ago a middle_western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior_design . 
2096	br-e29	30	65	47114	At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art '' . 
2097	br-e29	30	66	47142	This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer . 
2098	br-e29	31	67	47161	We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior_design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take_on the usual accompaniments of teaching - minimal income and minimal status among their confreres . 
2099	br-e29	32	68	47201	Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such_as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable . 
2100	br-e29	33	69	47219	In all `` degree '' courses in interior_design a number of `` academic '' or `` general studies '' courses are included . 
2101	br-e29	33	70	47242	It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and_so_on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior_design , as are the art_teachers educated in the academic subjects . 
2102	br-e29	33	71	47281	The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only_if this standard is observed . 
2103	br-e29	33	72	47299	The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken_into_account . 
2104	br-e29	34	73	47315	One technical question of school organization comes_to_mind here . 
2105	br-e29	34	74	47324	For proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at_least one level above that for which the student is a candidate . 
2106	br-e29	34	75	47351	Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior_design this rule cannot at_present be observed . 
2107	br-e29	34	76	47372	Indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at_all . 
2108	br-e29	34	77	47395	The question , however , cannot be ignored for long . 
2109	br-e29	34	78	47406	The basic problem involved is that a college setting_up a graduate_school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree . 
2110	br-e29	34	79	47428	Most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers . 
2111	br-e29	34	80	47447	One solution is the acquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute . 
2112	br-e29	34	81	47463	It is a sort_of academic ring-around-a_rosy and you solve it . 
2113	br-e29	35	82	47474	This brings us to the question of accreditation of art_schools in_general . 
2114	br-e29	35	83	47486	Only the independent art_schools , that_is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations . 
2115	br-e29	35	84	47515	It has been the custom for most universities to stretch_the_blanket of accreditation for their liberal_arts school to cover_the_shivering_body of their fine_arts department . 
2116	br-e29	35	85	47538	This , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior_design to the many subjects of their home_economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior_design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior_design . 
2117	br-e29	35	86	47582	In_spite_of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject . 
2118	br-e29	36	87	47597	There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art_schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation - as do medical_schools - by an art accreditation group such_as the `` National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art '' . 
2119	br-e29	37	88	47634	Independent art_schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group . 
2120	br-f03	1	1	47653	There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement . 
2121	br-f03	1	2	47677	You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before . 
2122	br-f03	1	3	47696	I can n't tell when , but I'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! 
2123	br-f03	2	4	47722	This experience will have happened to many of you . 
2124	br-f03	3	5	47732	Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' . 
2125	br-f03	4	6	47806	Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja_vu ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences . 
2126	br-f03	4	7	47833	In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all_of us grope continually . 
2127	br-f03	5	8	47855	When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja_vu , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar . 
2128	br-f03	5	9	47892	Occasionally there are examples of prevision which cannot be pushed_aside without confessing an unscientific attitude . 
2129	br-f03	6	10	47908	One day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in_advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified . 
2130	br-f03	7	11	47945	Rudyard_Kipling 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? 
2131	br-f03	7	12	47981	The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something_About_Myself . 
2132	br-f03	8	13	47993	One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster_Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . 
2133	br-f03	8	14	48050	At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . 
2134	br-f03	9	15	48083	Freud probably contributed more_than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . 
2135	br-f03	9	16	48106	However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation_Of_Dreams , Chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . 
2136	br-f03	10	17	48208	Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . 
2137	br-f03	10	18	48221	The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities . 
2138	br-f03	11	19	48255	I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town . 
2139	br-f03	11	20	48281	I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in_detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen . 
2140	br-f03	11	21	48310	And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious_mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . 
2141	br-f03	12	22	48352	Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence . 
2142	br-f03	13	23	48384	The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ? 
2143	br-f03	14	24	48395	Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ? 
2144	br-f03	15	25	48405	Every dream , and this is true of a mental_image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic_phenomenon for which no explanation is available . 
2145	br-f03	15	26	48442	In most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects . 
2146	br-f03	15	27	48456	But these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we do n't remember having seen in real_life . 
2147	br-f03	15	28	48478	For_instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and , with photographic realism , sees Smith driving the car ; whereas , it is a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car . 
2148	br-f03	15	29	48515	There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams . 
2149	br-f03	16	30	48543	The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental_image can find no logical support . 
2150	br-f03	16	31	48562	A `` mental_image '' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at_all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth_dimension . 
2151	br-f03	17	32	48612	Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call_for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja_vu , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem . 
2152	br-f03	18	33	48649	As in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain . 
2153	br-f03	18	34	48672	But then this theory confesses that it is completely at_a_loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain . 
2154	br-f03	18	35	48695	The opening paragraph of the chapter titled The_Theory_Of_Representative_Perception , in the book Philosophies_Of_Science by Albert_G._Ramsperger says , `` passed_on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception '' . 
2155	br-f03	19	36	48736	But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? 
2156	br-f03	19	37	48750	As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather_than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location . 
2157	br-f03	19	38	48808	Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . 
2158	br-f03	20	39	48859	Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists_of minute waves of energy . 
2159	br-f03	20	40	48874	We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound_waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . 
2160	br-f03	20	41	48910	So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states_of_matter , successive one_after_another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies . 
2161	br-f03	20	42	48945	This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness . 
2162	br-f03	21	43	48965	Space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions . 
2163	br-f03	21	44	48977	If the fourth_dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? 
2164	br-f03	21	45	48996	It is not through space nor time that the time_machine most approved by science_fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever existent past fantasy future . 
2165	br-f03	21	46	49029	Three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events . 
2166	br-f03	22	47	49072	The body , senses and brain , in_common_with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies . 
2167	br-f03	22	48	49095	The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them . 
2168	br-f03	22	49	49127	Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions . 
2169	br-f03	22	50	49140	When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep . 
2170	br-f03	23	51	49183	If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real_life . 
2171	br-f03	24	52	49235	Dr._H._V._Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University_of_Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification . 
2172	br-f03	24	53	49294	As_a_matter_of_fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr._Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day . 
2173	br-f03	24	54	49321	Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest 's information . 
2174	br-f03	24	55	49351	Dr._Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream . 
2175	br-f03	24	56	49367	He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite , and imagined it must have been German or English . 
2176	br-f03	25	57	49388	We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr._Hilprecht 's subconscious reasoning . 
2177	br-f03	25	58	49415	But , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? 
2178	br-f03	25	59	49449	Which theory is more fantastic : 1 . 
2179	br-f03	25	60	49457	that the perfect continuity was composed from the job_lot of memory impressions in the professor 's brain , or 2 . 
2180	br-f03	25	61	49478	that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met ? 
2181	br-f03	26	62	49507	The degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja_vu feeling . 
2182	br-f03	26	63	49543	No_doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper 's mind . 
2183	br-f03	26	64	49560	Probably less_than one_percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake . 
2184	br-f03	26	65	49573	When we arrive_at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of_course , cannot impress us as anything familiar . 
2185	br-f03	26	66	49595	Nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja_vu , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists . 
2186	br-f03	26	67	49643	If deja_vu is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental_disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people . 
2187	br-f03	27	68	49665	Chauncey_Depew , one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination , was attending a convention at Saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel_Theodore_Roosevelt for Governor of New_York when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met . 
2188	br-f03	27	69	49708	After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt . 
2189	br-f03	27	70	49729	If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja_vu . 
2190	br-f03	27	71	49770	But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene . 
2191	br-f03	27	72	49783	He remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had . 
2192	br-f03	28	73	49803	One week before the convention , Depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson , gazing at the opposite shore . 
2193	br-f10	1	1	49829	Franklin_D._Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs._Claire_Shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in Bakersfield , California , several months ago as a prospective patient . 
2194	br-f10	1	2	49859	`` Doctor '' Lee asked her to lie_down on a bed and remove her shoes . 
2195	br-f10	1	3	49875	Then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came_up - presto - with a different diagnosis with each squeeze . 
2196	br-f10	1	4	49897	She had - he informed her - kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder . 
2197	br-f10	1	5	49916	( He explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all_of the nervous_system was connected to it . ) 
2198	br-f10	1	6	49939	He knew just the thing for her - a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator '' machine . 
2199	br-f10	2	7	49959	As he applied the applicator extending from the machine - which consisted_of seven differently colored neon_tubes superimposed on a rectangular base - to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs._Shaefer 's body , Lee kept_up a steady stream of pseudo scientific mumbo-jumbo . 
2200	br-f10	2	8	50001	Yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her . 
2201	br-f10	2	9	50017	Did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people 's health ? 
2202	br-f10	2	10	50037	The human_body - he pointed_out , for_example - required 33 units of blue light . 
2203	br-f10	2	11	50052	For that reason , he informed her , the Lord made the sky blue . 
2204	br-f10	2	12	50067	Continuing glibly in this vein , he paused to comfort her : 
2205	br-f10	3	13	50079	`` Do n't you worry . 
2206	br-f10	3	14	50085	This machine will cure your cancer ridden body '' . 
2207	br-f10	4	15	50095	`` Cancer '' ! 
2208	br-f10	4	16	50099	Mrs._Shaefer practically shrieked . 
2209	br-f10	4	17	50103	`` You did n't tell me I had cancer '' . 
2210	br-f10	5	18	50114	`` You have it , all_right . 
2211	br-f10	5	19	50121	But as_long_as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about . 
2212	br-f10	5	20	50137	Why , I once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body '' . 
2213	br-f10	6	21	50158	He urged her to buy one of his machines - for $ 300 . 
2214	br-f10	6	22	50172	When she said that she did n't have the money , he said that she could come_in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one . 
2215	br-f10	6	23	50203	He then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look_like a girl again '' , and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away . 
2216	br-f10	7	24	50240	Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs._Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day . 
2217	br-f10	7	25	50258	After another treatment with the machine , he told her that `` her entire body was shot_through with tumors and cysts '' . 
2218	br-f10	7	26	50281	He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take_care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine . 
2219	br-f10	8	27	50308	When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , Mrs._Shaefer felt intense pain . 
2220	br-f10	8	28	50323	Leaving Lee 's office , Mrs._Shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue . 
2221	br-f10	8	29	50343	For several days , she was ill as a result of Lee 's treatment . 
2222	br-f10	9	30	50358	Mrs._Shaefer never got_around_to joining the thousand or_so people who paid Lee some $ 30000 for his ozone machines . 
2223	br-f10	9	31	50377	For Mrs._Shaefer - who had been given a clean bill_of_health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee - and her friend were agents for the California_Pure_Food and Drug_Inspection_Bureau . 
2224	br-f10	9	32	50409	And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of Lee 's quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape_recorder under her friend 's clothing , proved adequate in court for convicting Franklin_D._Lee . 
2225	br-f10	9	33	50444	The charge : violation of the California Medical_Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs . 
2226	br-f10	9	34	50464	The sentence : 360 days ' confinement in the county jail . 
2227	br-f10	10	35	50476	An isolated case of quackery ? 
2228	br-f10	10	36	50482	By_no_means . 
2229	br-f10	10	37	50484	Rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases . 
2230	br-f10	10	38	50532	The machine quack makes his Rube_Goldberg devices out of odds_and_ends of metals , wires , and radio parts . 
2231	br-f10	11	39	50551	With these gadgets - impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light_bulbs , ticks , and buzzes - he then carries_out a vicious medical con_game , capitalizing on people 's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age . 
2232	br-f10	11	40	50594	He milks the latest scientific advances , translating them into his own special Buck_Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay_fever to sexual impotence and cancer . 
2233	br-f10	12	41	50627	The gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $ 5 to $ 10000 - anything the traffic will bear . 
2234	br-f10	12	42	50649	He may call himself a naprapath , a physiotherapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor '' - or what have you . 
2235	br-f10	12	43	50685	Not_only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations - foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence . 
2236	br-f10	13	44	50717	The medical device pirate of today , of_course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear - the gallus snapping hawker of snake_oil and other patent_medicines . 
2237	br-f10	13	45	50748	His plunder is therefore far higher - running into hundreds of millions . 
2238	br-f10	14	46	50761	According_to the Food_and_Drug_Administration ( FDA ) , `` Doctor '' Ghadiali , Dr._Albert_Abrams and his clique , and Dr._Wilhelm_Reich - to name three notorious device quacks - succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines . 
2239	br-f10	15	47	50804	Authorities believe that many_of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business . 
2240	br-f10	15	48	50821	Look_at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland . 
2241	br-f10	15	49	50833	Sarah_Gross , a dress_shop proprietor , paid $ 1020 to a masseur , and Mr._A. , a laborer , paid $ 4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . 
2242	br-f10	15	50	50876	Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually . 
2243	br-f10	15	51	50893	You will come_up with a frightening total . 
2244	br-f10	16	52	50901	That 's why the FDA , the American_Medical_Association ( AMA ) , and the National_Better_Business_Bureau ( BBB ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $ 610 million or_so paid to medical charlatans annually . 
2245	br-f10	17	53	50943	The Postmaster_General recently reported that mail_order frauds - among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently - are at the highest level in history . 
2246	br-f10	17	54	50967	Similarly , the American_Cancer_Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis_and_Rheumatism_Foundation , and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high . 
2247	br-f10	17	55	50994	For_example , the BBB has reported it was receiving four_times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as_many complaints compared with two years ago . 
2248	br-f10	18	56	51021	Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come_up with is only a surface manifestation - turned_up by their inevitably limited policing - of the real loot of the medical racketeer . 
2249	br-f10	18	57	51059	In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative . 
2250	br-f10	19	58	51075	The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of_course . 
2251	br-f10	19	59	51088	But it is our health - more precious than all the money in the world - that these modern witch_doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away . 
2252	br-f10	19	60	51117	By preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical_care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity . 
2253	br-f10	20	61	51154	Typically , Sarah_Gross and Mr._A both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks . 
2254	br-f10	20	62	51176	Sarah_Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her . 
2255	br-f10	20	63	51195	As a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor '' was using were phony . 
2256	br-f10	20	64	51218	She suffered a nervous_breakdown and had to be institutionalized . 
2257	br-f10	21	65	51228	Mr._A. , her fellow townsman , also experienced a nervous_breakdown just as_soon_as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife - a woman suffering from an incurable disease , multiple_sclerosis - and himself . 
2258	br-f10	21	66	51275	Mr._A has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man . 
2259	br-f10	21	67	51289	`` That 's a lot of hard earned money to lose '' , he says today . 
2260	br-f10	21	68	51306	`` Neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor 's treatments '' . 
2261	br-f10	22	69	51321	And there was the case of Tom_Hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what Doctor_Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine . 
2262	br-f10	22	70	51364	After his pains got_worse , Tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung . 
2263	br-f10	22	71	51390	Yes , Tom caught it in_time to stay alive . 
2264	br-f10	22	72	51400	But he 's a welfare_case now - a human wreck - thanks to this modern witch_doctor . 
2265	br-f10	23	73	51417	But the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering . 
2266	br-f10	23	74	51429	In such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart_disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste_of_time by the patient with Doctor_Fraud 's cure-all gadget can prove fatal . 
2267	br-f10	23	75	51462	Moreover , the diabetic patient who relies_on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts_off his insulin intake can be committing suicide . 
2268	br-f10	23	76	51485	For_instance : 
2269	br-f10	24	77	51487	In Chicago , some time ago , Mr._H. , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike '' - a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent - sold by the Vrilium_Company of Chicago for $ 306 as a cure-all . 
2270	br-f10	24	78	51553	`` Hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy , and its rays will cure any disease you have '' , said the company . 
2271	br-f10	24	79	51584	Mr._H. is dead today because he followed this advice . 
2272	br-f10	25	80	51594	Doris_Hull , suffering from tuberculosis , was taken by her husband to see Otis_G._Carroll , a sanipractor - a licensed drugless healer - in Spokane . 
2273	br-f10	25	81	51620	Carroll diagnosed Mrs._Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his `` radionic '' machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $ 50 ) . 
2274	br-f10	26	82	51651	His prescription : hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water . 
2275	br-f10	26	83	51665	Although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him , Carroll permitted her to go on a 10 - day fast in which she took nothing but water . 
2276	br-f10	26	84	51695	Inevitably , Mrs._Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis , weighing 60 pounds . 
2277	br-f10	26	85	51708	Moreover , her husband and child contracted T.B. from her . 
2278	br-f10	26	86	51719	( Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $ 35823 for his wife 's death . ) 
2279	br-f10	27	87	51737	In California , a_few years ago , a ghoul by the name of H._F._Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer . 
2280	br-f10	27	88	51760	He did this by the charming practice of buying_up used electric blankets for $ 5 to $ 10 from survivors of patients who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $ 185 each . 
2281	br-f10	27	89	51797	When authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got_off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victims was not around to testify : He was dead of cancer . 
2282	br-f10	28	90	51842	By_no_means are these isolated cases . 
2283	br-f10	28	91	51848	`` Unfortunately '' , says Chief_Postal_Inspector_David_H._Stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , `` the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called_up in court '' . 
2284	br-f10	29	92	51897	Death ! 
2285	br-f10	29	93	51899	Have no_doubt about it . 
2286	br-f10	29	94	51904	That 's where device quackery can lead . 
2287	br-f10	29	95	51912	The evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands . 
2288	br-f10	30	96	51933	Who are the victims of the device quacks ? 
2289	br-f10	30	97	51942	Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target . 
2290	br-f10	30	98	51951	Says Wallace_F._Jannsen , director of the FDA 's Division_of_Public_Information : `` Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such_as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer . 
2291	br-f10	30	99	51990	People who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken_in by quacks '' . 
2292	br-f10	30	100	52013	The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like Mr._A. , who scrape_up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor_Fraud 's avarice . 
2293	br-f10	30	101	52041	They are often ignorant as_well_as underprivileged . 
2294	br-f19	1	1	52048	The popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America . 
2295	br-f19	1	2	52066	And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in_proportion_to the growth of American influence across the world . 
2296	br-f19	1	3	52084	Thus , if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century , we will do_well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset . 
2297	br-f19	2	4	52115	Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence . 
2298	br-f19	2	5	52129	1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in_terms_of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions . 
2299	br-f19	2	6	52158	What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred . 
2300	br-f19	2	7	52178	2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness . 
2301	br-f19	2	8	52203	Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account_for group_actions , to provide a focal_point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification . 
2302	br-f19	3	9	52237	One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United_States in more recent years . 
2303	br-f19	3	10	52275	The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American_War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass_media are cases_in_point . 
2304	br-f19	3	11	52306	Nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of American life , that learned societies such_as the American_Folklore_Society and the American_Historical_Association were founded in the 1880's , or that courses in American literature , American civilization , American anything have swept our school and college curricula . 
2305	br-f19	4	12	52368	Of_course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth century United_States . 
2306	br-f19	4	13	52402	Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street . 
2307	br-f19	4	14	52418	It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point_of_view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . 
2308	br-f19	4	15	52455	After_all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . 
2309	br-f19	4	16	52516	Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . 
2310	br-f19	4	17	52537	Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . 
2311	br-f19	5	18	52557	In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose . 
2312	br-f19	5	19	52569	A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever_changing land . 
2313	br-f19	5	20	52591	But we must never forget , most_of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends . 
2314	br-f19	5	21	52621	Parson_Weems 's George_Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting States . 
2315	br-f19	5	22	52638	Abraham_Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution . 
2316	br-f19	5	23	52648	Robert_E._Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy . 
2317	br-f19	5	24	52658	And their roles are paralleled by those of Patrick_Henry , Nathan_Hale , Andrew_Jackson , Davy_Crockett , Theodore_Roosevelt and many , many more . 
2318	br-f19	6	25	52681	Therefore , the scholar , as he looks_at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts . 
2319	br-f19	6	26	52705	1 ) Most_of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at_all . 
2320	br-f19	6	27	52729	2 ) The concept that an `` American national folklore '' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend . 
2321	br-f19	7	28	52748	Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission . 
2322	br-f19	7	29	52768	It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression . 
2323	br-f19	7	30	52795	Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence . 
2324	br-f19	7	31	52822	Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . 
2325	br-f19	8	32	52846	In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this . 
2326	br-f19	8	33	52869	Enthusiastically , Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul_Bunyan tales , Abe_Lincoln anecdotes and labor_union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition . 
2327	br-f19	8	34	52897	Nor have we remembered that in the melting_pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material . 
2328	br-f19	9	35	52951	Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . 
2329	br-f19	9	36	52975	That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant . 
2330	br-f19	9	37	53014	As_long_as his material is Americana , can in_some_way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied . 
2331	br-f19	10	38	53040	From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth century American folklore . 
2332	br-f19	10	39	53062	On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought_out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make_up this nation . 
2333	br-f19	10	40	53109	On the other we have the flag_wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . 
2334	br-f19	10	41	53138	Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways . 
2335	br-f19	10	42	53178	After_all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates . 
2336	br-f19	10	43	53196	In_addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever expanding and changing society . 
2337	br-f19	10	44	53234	The problems confuse even the experts . 
2338	br-f19	11	45	53241	For_that_matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed . 
2339	br-f19	11	46	53251	Anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four . 
2340	br-f19	11	47	53281	They have widely varying backgrounds and aims . 
2341	br-f19	11	48	53289	They have little `` esprit_de_corps '' . 
2342	br-f19	12	49	53296	The outlook for the amateur , for_instance , is usually dependent_on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque . 
2343	br-f19	12	50	53317	His love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he does n't care much about the dollar_sign or the footnote . 
2344	br-f19	12	51	53339	Folklore is his hobby , and he , all_too rightly , wishes it to remain as such . 
2345	br-f19	12	52	53357	The amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more_than the amateur who has taken_to the field . 
2346	br-f19	12	53	53379	The collector enjoys the contact with rural life ; he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reasons that many persons hunt game ; and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located . 
2347	br-f19	12	54	53422	Fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them do n't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material . 
2348	br-f19	13	55	53451	But there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts - one dominated_by money , the other by nineteenth century German scholarship . 
2349	br-f19	13	56	53474	Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found . 
2350	br-f19	13	57	53494	Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage_system and the electric light lines . 
2351	br-f19	13	58	53512	The commercial propagandist , who can n't afford to be critical , gets_along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst 's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine . 
2352	br-f19	13	59	53552	His standards are , of_course , completely foreign to those of the analyst . 
2353	br-f19	13	60	53566	To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications . 
2354	br-f19	13	61	53589	Dominated_by the vicious_circle of the university promotion_system , the analyst looks_down_on and gets_along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector . 
2355	br-f19	14	62	53619	The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a_few energetic amateurs and collectors . 
2356	br-f19	14	63	53640	The work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no_more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience . 
2357	br-f19	14	64	53678	Publishers want books that will sell , recording_studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used_to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high_schools want quaint , but moral , material . 
2358	br-f19	14	65	53712	The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit_in . 
2359	br-f19	14	66	53723	As a result , most people do n't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ; they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown_in here_and_there . 
2360	br-f19	14	67	53765	And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college_level most_of the hundred odd folklore courses given in the United_States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone . 
2361	br-f19	15	68	53800	If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public . 
2362	br-f19	15	69	53835	And while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each . 
2363	br-f19	15	70	53863	Does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall_tale and a true product of the folk ? 
2364	br-f19	15	71	53885	When the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? 
2365	br-f19	15	72	53907	Is the writer propagandistic ? 
2366	br-f19	15	73	53912	Is he swept_away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was ? 
2367	br-f19	15	74	53925	Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? 
2368	br-f19	16	75	53950	When he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged . 
2369	br-f19	16	76	53963	In_the_first_place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale . 
2370	br-f19	16	77	53988	Robert_Frost , for_instance , writes about rural life in New_England , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems . 
2371	br-f19	16	78	54013	This has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk_poet '' , simply because he is a rural one . 
2372	br-f19	16	79	54037	In the second place , a large_number of writers , making a more direct claim than Frost to being `` folk_writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material . 
2373	br-f19	16	80	54075	Stephen_Vincent_Benet 's John_Brown's_Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John_Steinbeck 's The_Grapes_of_Wrath and Carl_Sandburg 's The_People,_Yes . 
2374	br-f19	16	81	54096	The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass . 
2375	br-f19	16	82	54135	Folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it . 
2376	br-f19	16	83	54156	The folk are simply not homogeneous with_respect_to nation or political attitude . 
2377	br-f19	16	84	54168	In_fact , there is much evidence to indicate they do n't care a_bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits . 
2378	br-f19	16	85	54193	Nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for `` the_good_old_days '' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk . 
2379	br-f43	1	1	54267	Color was delayed until 1935 , the wide_screen until the early fifties . 
2380	br-f43	2	2	54280	Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties . 
2381	br-f43	2	3	54298	Each film consisted_of fifty feet , which gives a running_time of about one minute on the screen . 
2382	br-f43	2	4	54316	As_long_as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further . 
2383	br-f43	2	5	54332	Motion-picture exhibitions took_place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny_arcade which can still be found in such urban_areas as Times_Square . 
2384	br-f43	2	6	54357	Brief snips of actual events were shown : parades , dances , street scenes . 
2385	br-f43	2	7	54372	The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity : 
2386	br-f43	2	8	54379	a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats . 
2387	br-f43	2	9	54398	An early Edison production was The_Execution_of_Mary_Queen_of_Scotts . 
2388	br-f43	2	10	54405	The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ; the headsman swung his axe ; the head dropped off ; end of film . 
2389	br-f43	2	11	54427	An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo_Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage . 
2390	br-f43	3	12	54452	In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large_numbers from the simple-minded , one minute shows . 
2391	br-f43	3	13	54496	In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion_picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day . 
2392	br-f43	3	14	54527	Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at_heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short_story . 
2393	br-f43	3	15	54576	Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature . 
2394	br-f43	3	16	54597	Thus such great American documentaries as The_River and The_Plow_That_Broke_the_Plains were composed as visual stories rather_than as illustrated lectures . 
2395	br-f43	3	17	54616	The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges_Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin_S._Porter . 
2396	br-f43	3	18	54658	Of the two , Porter is justly the better_known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first_step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion_picture the intricate , efficient time_machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands . 
2397	br-f43	4	19	54713	Melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film . 
2398	br-f43	4	20	54745	One of these is the `` dissolve '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene . 
2399	br-f43	4	21	54766	As the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear . 
2400	br-f43	4	22	54781	For a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger . 
2401	br-f43	4	23	54801	In a series of fairy_tales and fantasies , Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions . 
2402	br-f43	4	24	54839	Immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time . 
2403	br-f43	4	25	54866	Physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at_a_time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers '' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing . 
2404	br-f43	4	26	54906	Linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement . 
2405	br-f43	4	27	54924	The `` projection '' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions . 
2406	br-f43	4	28	54953	So is the time of the novel . 
2407	br-f43	4	29	54961	The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know . 
2408	br-f43	4	30	55010	The time of the motion_picture is fixed absolutely . 
2409	br-f43	4	31	55019	The film consists_of a series of still , transparent photographs , or `` frames '' , 35 - mm. - wide . 
2410	br-f43	4	32	55041	Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent_movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second . 
2411	br-f43	4	33	55082	This is the rate of projection ; it is also the rate of photographing . 
2412	br-f43	4	34	55097	Time is built into the motion_picture , which cannot exist without time . 
2413	br-f43	4	35	55110	Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end - elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence . 
2414	br-f43	4	36	55159	The `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to_be_sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . 
2415	br-f43	4	37	55224	In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film . 
2416	br-f43	4	38	55237	Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time . 
2417	br-f43	4	39	55262	This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician 's tricks produced on film . 
2418	br-f43	5	40	55282	It was Porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued . 
2419	br-f43	5	41	55311	The movie was The Great_Train_Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all_but incalculable . 
2420	br-f43	5	42	55329	Overnight , for_one_thing , Porter 's film multiplied the standard running_time of movies by ten . 
2421	br-f43	5	43	55345	The Great_Train_Robbery is a one reel film . 
2422	br-f43	5	44	55353	One reel - from eight to twelve minutes - became the standard length from the year of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth_of_a_Nation in 1915 . 
2423	br-f43	5	45	55385	The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies . 
2424	br-f43	6	46	55400	The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself ; much of_it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of_it - good_guys and bad_guys in the old West - pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's . 
2425	br-f43	6	47	55444	A band of robbers enters a railroad_station , overpowers and ties_up the telegraph_operator , holds_up the train and escapes . 
2426	br-f43	6	48	55464	A posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping_it_up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out . 
2427	br-f43	6	49	55493	The robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse . 
2428	br-f43	6	50	55515	As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking_aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience . 
2429	br-f43	7	51	55537	All this is simple enough , but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before . 
2430	br-f43	7	52	55560	Each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , Porter 's camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play . 
2431	br-f43	7	53	55634	The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen . 
2432	br-f43	7	54	55659	If the change , at_first_sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the Italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen . 
2433	br-f43	7	55	55708	In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as_well_as a mechanical recording device . 
2434	br-f43	8	56	55735	He did more than that . 
2435	br-f43	8	57	55741	He revealed the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film . 
2436	br-f43	8	58	55762	Cutting , of_course , takes_place automatically in the creation of a film . 
2437	br-f43	8	59	55775	The meaning of the word is quite physical , to_begin_with . 
2438	br-f43	8	60	55786	The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence . 
2439	br-f43	8	61	55825	If , as a home_movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event . 
2440	br-f43	8	62	55853	If , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a_few frames of the child 's grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film ; you are employing the basic technique of film ; you are cutting . 
2441	br-f43	9	63	55908	This is what Porter did . 
2442	br-f43	9	64	55914	As the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts_back to the station , where the telegrapher 's little daughter arrives with her father 's dinner_pail only to find him bound on the floor . 
2443	br-f43	9	65	55951	She dashes around in alarm . 
2444	br-f43	9	66	55957	The two events are taking_place at_the_same_time . 
2445	br-f43	9	67	55964	Time and space have both become cinematic . 
2446	br-f43	9	68	55972	We leap from event to event - including the formation of the posse - even though the events , in `` reality '' are taking_place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance . 
2447	br-f43	10	69	56014	The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates_from The_Great_Train_Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device . 
2448	br-f43	10	70	56040	The chase in itself is a narrative ; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . 
2449	br-f43	10	71	56075	The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . 
2450	br-f43	10	72	56104	The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not_only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these films and these sequences are also seeking_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative . 
2451	br-f43	11	73	56160	There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . 
2452	br-f43	11	74	56186	The man was D.W._Griffith . 
2453	br-f43	11	75	56191	When he came to the movies - more_or_less by accident - they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes . 
2454	br-f43	11	76	56218	In about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film_maker . 
2455	br-f43	11	77	56241	Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film . 
2456	br-f43	12	78	56254	Not that there had not been attempts , mostly European , to do exactly that . 
2457	br-f43	12	79	56270	But in_general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself . 
2458	br-f43	12	80	56293	Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented . 
2459	br-f43	12	81	56305	Great actors and actresses - the most notable being Sarah_Bernhardt - were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera . 
2460	br-f43	12	82	56327	In all_of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art_work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author . 
2461	br-f43	12	83	56357	The phonograph today , for all its high_fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera . 
2462	br-f43	12	84	56386	Not surprisingly , this approach did not work . 
2463	br-f43	12	85	56395	The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names . 
2464	br-f43	12	86	56426	But no art at_all was_born of the art effort in the early movies . 
2465	br-g01	1	1	56440	Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil_rights and of integration . 
2466	br-g01	1	2	56452	They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare_state . 
2467	br-g01	1	3	56465	And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons . 
2468	br-g01	1	4	56489	The name presumably derives from the French royal_house which never learned and never forgot ; since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at_least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South . 
2469	br-g01	2	5	56530	The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North . 
2470	br-g01	2	6	56547	The race_problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive . 
2471	br-g01	2	7	56567	It is these other differences between North and South - other , that_is , than those which concern discrimination or social_welfare - which I chiefly discuss herein . 
2472	br-g01	3	8	56595	I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience . 
2473	br-g01	3	9	56605	A Southerner married to a New_Englander , I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity_men , and business_executives of egghead tastes . 
2474	br-g01	3	10	56640	Most_of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed_as , liberals . 
2475	br-g01	3	11	56656	This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government . 
2476	br-g01	3	12	56700	Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron_saints . 
2477	br-g01	3	13	56715	When I question them as_to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall_into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things do n't count any_more in the world of to-day . 
2478	br-g01	3	14	56775	I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . 
2479	br-g01	4	15	56789	I take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? 
2480	br-g01	4	16	56803	- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as_well_as democratic processes may have to yield before it . 
2481	br-g01	4	17	56841	This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a President of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme_Court . 
2482	br-g01	4	18	56872	As for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms . 
2483	br-g01	5	19	56905	The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one . 
2484	br-g01	5	20	56938	Why , in_the_first_place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ? 
2485	br-g01	5	21	56963	If he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? 
2486	br-g01	5	22	56981	And if he is so scornful of the rights of states , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ? 
2487	br-g01	6	23	57008	I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal 's attitude toward the South . 
2488	br-g01	6	24	57025	It appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends . 
2489	br-g01	6	25	57049	His assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at_least partly in_sympathy_with his views . 
2490	br-g01	6	26	57078	Time 's editor , Thomas_Griffith , in his book , The Waist High Culture , wrote : `` most of what was different about it ( the Deep_South ) I found myself unsympathetic to '' . 
2491	br-g01	6	27	57114	This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement . 
2492	br-g01	6	28	57127	Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism . 
2493	br-g01	7	29	57148	I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North . 
2494	br-g01	7	30	57165	In business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found . 
2495	br-g01	7	31	57181	But in our case - and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts - the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come_close to wrecking several more . 
2496	br-g01	7	32	57222	In_fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down . 
2497	br-g01	8	33	57282	Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up_against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view . 
2498	br-g01	8	34	57311	But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee hatred displayed in social gatherings . 
2499	br-g01	8	35	57334	From my wife 's experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles . 
2500	br-g01	8	36	57353	The strong feeling is certainly there ; but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South , especially among those who studied in the North . 
2501	br-g01	8	37	57383	And social_relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting Northerners . 
2502	br-g01	8	38	57403	Also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems . 
2503	br-g01	9	39	57422	There are of_course many Souths ; but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who have n't . 
2504	br-g01	9	40	57449	My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War . 
2505	br-g01	9	41	57473	Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category . 
2506	br-g01	9	42	57484	I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe . 
2507	br-g01	9	43	57500	I never heard of a poll being taken on the question . 
2508	br-g01	9	44	57512	No_doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic . 
2509	br-g01	9	45	57521	Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy . 
2510	br-g01	9	46	57538	Since the Supreme_Court 's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little_Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old_South . 
2511	br-g01	10	47	57577	Belief in the traditional way_of_life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones . 
2512	br-g01	10	48	57595	Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South_Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North_Carolina , and Alabama following along after them . 
2513	br-g01	10	49	57620	Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; so_that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper_limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old_South from the new , but with , of_course , important minority enclaves . 
2514	br-g01	11	50	57666	The long settled areas of states like Virginia and South_Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater . 
2515	br-g01	11	51	57701	Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such_as the coastal lowlands centering_on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West_Indies than with the North even after independence . 
2516	br-g01	11	52	57736	The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area . 
2517	br-g01	11	53	57749	In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old_South . 
2518	br-g01	11	54	57761	Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no_longer any hope of sharing_in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother_country . 
2519	br-g01	11	55	57810	And no_doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . 
2520	br-g01	12	56	57843	Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . 
2521	br-g01	12	57	57861	All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did . 
2522	br-g01	12	58	57892	Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties . 
2523	br-g01	12	59	57923	But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South - to use the moderate words favored by Mr._Thomas_Griffith - finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North . 
2524	br-g01	12	60	57959	And this , in_effect , means most of modern America . 
2525	br-g01	13	61	57970	It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise . 
2526	br-g01	13	62	57982	And therein , I feel , many Northerners delude themselves about the South . 
2527	br-g01	13	63	57996	For_one_thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed . 
2528	br-g01	13	64	58008	There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it . 
2529	br-g01	13	65	58020	I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful_thinking : do n't talk_about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take_care of themselves . 
2530	br-g01	13	66	58045	Or_else the North really believes that all Southerners except a_few quaint old characters have come_around to realizing the errors of their past , and are now at_heart sharers of the American_Dream , like everybody else . 
2531	br-g01	14	67	58081	If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true . 
2532	br-g01	14	68	58098	The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western world . 
2533	br-g01	14	69	58113	Regardless_of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre World_War_I , great_power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike . 
2534	br-g01	14	70	58158	And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent . 
2535	br-g01	14	71	58172	This is the only case in modern history of a_people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view_as foreign domination . 
2536	br-g01	14	72	58196	The fact is_due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold . 
2537	br-g01	14	73	58209	In every war of the United_States since the Civil_War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country . 
2538	br-g01	14	74	58230	So instead of being tests of the South 's loyalty , the Spanish_War , the two World_Wars , and the Korean_War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion . 
2539	br-g01	14	75	58261	And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold_war against Communism . 
2540	br-g01	14	76	58280	Had the situation been reversed , had , for_instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New_England , there is little doubt that large_numbers of Southerners would have happily put_on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain . 
2541	br-g01	14	77	58328	It is extraordinary that a_people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have . 
2542	br-g01	14	78	58348	The North should thank_its_stars that such has been the case ; but at_the_same_time it should not draw false inferences therefrom . 
2543	br-g01	15	79	58369	The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries . 
2544	br-g01	15	80	58388	There is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them . 
2545	br-g01	15	81	58404	Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites . 
2546	br-g01	15	82	58413	Most_of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure . 
2547	br-g01	15	83	58434	Many Northerners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly . 
2548	br-g01	15	84	58450	The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives . 
2549	br-g01	15	85	58467	But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . 
2550	br-g01	15	86	58481	They believe that if the South had been let_alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America . 
2551	br-g01	15	87	58503	As_it_is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in_spite_of its high standard_of_living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter . 
2552	br-g01	16	88	58551	The South 's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure . 
2553	br-g01	16	89	58584	Their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ; and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as_much_as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home_town . 
2554	br-g11	1	1	58630	As cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy increasing properties of the external world . 
2555	br-g11	1	2	58661	The useful suggestion of Professor_David_Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments . 
2556	br-g11	1	3	58699	One wonders about its applicability to people . 
2557	br-g11	1	4	58707	Will advances in human sciences help us build social_structures and governments which will enable us to cope_with people as_effectively_as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic_acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? 
2558	br-g11	1	5	58750	The answer is of_course yes . 
2559	br-g11	1	6	58756	For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . 
2560	br-g11	1	7	58791	Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes . 
2561	br-g11	1	8	58826	But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides . 
2562	br-g11	1	9	58855	We have ample light when the sun sets ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; the range of our voice ignores distance . 
2563	br-g11	1	10	58895	At what stage are social_sciences then ? 
2564	br-g11	1	11	58902	Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? 
2565	br-g11	1	12	58920	There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud . 
2566	br-g11	1	13	58936	And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact . 
2567	br-g11	2	14	58955	Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man . 
2568	br-g11	2	15	58995	Constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world_courts , and the veto power in world_councils are but a_few examples . 
2569	br-g11	2	16	59030	Most_of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it . 
2570	br-g11	2	17	59071	The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme . 
2571	br-g11	2	18	59101	Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding . 
2572	br-g11	2	19	59126	We are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very_much at the mercy of man . 
2573	br-g11	2	20	59147	In_fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day_by_day increasing our fear of each other . 
2574	br-g11	3	21	59164	I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear . 
2575	br-g11	3	22	59188	There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears . 
2576	br-g11	3	23	59215	Lucretius has remarked : `` The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of God '' . 
2577	br-g11	3	24	59260	Perhaps things were even worse then . 
2578	br-g11	3	25	59267	It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man . 
2579	br-g11	3	26	59278	We get some clue from a_few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was . 
2580	br-g11	3	27	59307	We are not now afraid of atomic_bombs in the same way that people once feared comets . 
2581	br-g11	3	28	59324	The bombs are as_harmless_as an automobile in a garage . 
2582	br-g11	3	29	59334	We are worried about what people may do with them - that some crazy fool may `` push the button '' . 
2583	br-g11	4	30	59356	I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand_out quite clearly . 
2584	br-g11	4	31	59387	They are in_general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual . 
2585	br-g11	4	32	59404	They include both individual fears and collective ones . 
2586	br-g11	4	33	59413	They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not_only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . 
2587	br-g11	4	34	59445	Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . 
2588	br-g11	4	35	59496	Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act . 
2589	br-g11	4	36	59540	To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition . 
2590	br-g11	4	37	59565	But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . 
2591	br-g11	5	38	59578	The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize . 
2592	br-g11	5	39	59604	It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter_solstice . 
2593	br-g11	5	40	59635	This and other fears of the solar_system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions . 
2594	br-g11	5	41	59681	This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls . 
2595	br-g11	5	42	59701	In_fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers . 
2596	br-g11	5	43	59722	There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision . 
2597	br-g11	5	44	59732	A meteor could fall on San_Francisco . 
2598	br-g11	5	45	59739	Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought . 
2599	br-g11	5	46	59751	Our understanding of the solar_system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing . 
2600	br-g11	5	47	59780	Yet we no_longer feel uneasy . 
2601	br-g11	5	48	59786	This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in_common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war . 
2602	br-g11	5	49	59819	We , in our country , think_of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing . 
2603	br-g11	5	50	59846	And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at_least uncertain way on the details of how we behave . 
2604	br-g11	5	51	59874	What elements of our behavior are decisive ? 
2605	br-g11	5	52	59882	Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? 
2606	br-g11	5	53	59906	We have staved_off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of_it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective . 
2607	br-g11	6	54	59950	I think that we are here also talking_of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city . 
2608	br-g11	6	55	59985	If an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even_though he might not be able to act quickly enough . 
2609	br-g11	6	56	60012	With the group of boys it is different . 
2610	br-g11	6	57	60021	He does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side . 
2611	br-g11	6	58	60061	When confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others . 
2612	br-g11	6	59	60091	I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned , in_a_way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain_dance than the carrying_out of an experiment in physics . 
2613	br-g11	6	60	60138	I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break_loose . 
2614	br-g11	6	61	60155	Our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise . 
2615	br-g11	6	62	60176	We are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in_toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements . 
2616	br-g11	7	63	60204	Our collective policies , group and national , are similarly based on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determining them . 
2617	br-g11	7	64	60236	We use terms from our personal experience with individuals such_as `` trust '' , `` cheat '' , and `` get_tough '' . 
2618	br-g11	7	65	60259	We talk_about national character in the same way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial_bodies to move in circles . 
2619	br-g11	7	66	60280	We perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect . 
2620	br-g11	7	67	60297	Small wonder , then , that we fear . 
2621	br-g11	8	68	60306	The achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took_place three centuries ago . 
2622	br-g11	8	69	60320	What additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ? 
2623	br-g11	8	70	60335	In the physical_sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic_physics . 
2624	br-g11	8	71	60349	In the life_sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio - and physiological chemistry . 
2625	br-g11	8	72	60379	The major effect of these advances appears to lie_in the part they have played in the industrial_revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment . 
2626	br-g11	8	73	60415	In_addition , our way of dealing directly with natural_phenomena has also changed . 
2627	br-g11	8	74	60428	Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking , but where some explanations are possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquakes , the appropriate kind of human_action has been more adequately indicated . 
2628	br-g11	9	75	60466	Apparently the population as_a_whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears . 
2629	br-g11	9	76	60488	How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study . 
2630	br-g11	9	77	60503	In some areas , the progress is slower than in others . 
2631	br-g11	9	78	60515	In agriculture , for_example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster . 
2632	br-g11	9	79	60544	In child_care , the opposite extreme prevails ; procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory . 
2633	br-g11	9	80	60567	There are many domains in which understanding has brought_about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear . 
2634	br-g11	9	81	60586	Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared . 
2635	br-g11	9	82	60603	The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it . 
2636	br-g11	9	83	60645	In_fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in_this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears . 
2637	br-g11	9	84	60681	In_fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty . 
2638	br-g11	10	85	60720	Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease . 
2639	br-g11	10	86	60744	The situation with regard_to our attitude and `` control '' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with_respect_to people . 
2640	br-g11	10	87	60766	The fear of disease was formerly very_much the kind of fear I have tried to describe . 
2641	br-g15	1	1	60783	It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings_together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for Mann 's work . 
2642	br-g15	2	2	60823	The wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` bird like brain '' . 
2643	br-g15	2	3	60878	La^utner , for his part , `` belonged_to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in_order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so_far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' . 
2644	br-g15	3	4	60954	The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as_well . 
2645	br-g15	3	5	60973	His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other_than abasement and humiliation . 
2646	br-g15	3	6	61012	At_the_same_time the multiple transvestitism involved - the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby - touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby 's , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life . 
2647	br-g15	4	7	61064	The music which La^utner has composed for this episode is for_the_most_part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' . 
2648	br-g15	4	8	61083	But it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' . 
2649	br-g15	4	9	61124	And this occurs now , at the refrain of Jacoby 's song - at the point , in_fact , of the name `` Lizzy '' - ; a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius '' . 
2650	br-g15	4	10	61163	`` A miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn_away to reveal something nude '' . 
2651	br-g15	4	11	61183	It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife 's infidelity . 
2652	br-g15	4	12	61204	By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; he collapses , and dies . 
2653	br-g15	5	13	61226	In the work of every artist , I suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ; not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment . 
2654	br-g15	5	14	61288	So here . 
2655	br-g15	5	15	61291	The horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone_wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed_up as a whore dressing_up as a baby ; the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; the bringing_together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering '' ) ; the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann 's work . 
2656	br-g15	6	16	61425	When I try to work_out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , I come_up with the following ideas , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay . 
2657	br-g15	7	17	61464	Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann 's heroes . 
2658	br-g15	7	18	61476	The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns_on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love . 
2659	br-g15	7	19	61497	The release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or_else absolutely impossible ; and the motion toward it brings disaster . 
2660	br-g15	8	20	61523	This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; it is particularly the artist ( Tonio_Kro^ger , Aschenbach , Leverku^hn ) who suffers from it . 
2661	br-g15	8	21	61552	The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art . 
2662	br-g15	9	22	61574	Again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child . 
2663	br-g15	10	23	61609	Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing_up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann 's stories . 
2664	br-g15	11	24	61653	We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates . 
2665	br-g15	11	25	61672	For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody . 
2666	br-g15	11	26	61704	Professionally a lawyer , that_is_to_say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed_up , disguised - that_is , paradoxically , revealed - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child . 
2667	br-g15	11	27	61760	That this abandonment takes_place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring_down upon him the punishment for art ; that_is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann 's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even_though the constant elements of the artist nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and La^utner . 
2668	br-g15	12	28	61845	It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann 's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic . 
2669	br-g15	12	29	61877	In a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one_and_the_same . 
2670	br-g15	13	30	61895	Something of this can be learned from `` The_Way_to_the_Churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure . 
2671	br-g15	13	31	61933	There is no_more `` plot '' than that ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give . 
2672	br-g15	13	32	61959	The artistic interest , then , lies_in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness . 
2673	br-g15	14	33	61991	The first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent : `` The way to the churchyard ran_along beside the highroad , ran beside it all_the_way to the end ; that_is_to_say , to the churchyard '' . 
2674	br-g15	14	34	62031	And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction . 
2675	br-g15	14	35	62043	The highroad , one might say at_first , belongs_to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs_to death . 
2676	br-g15	14	36	62063	But that is too simple , and won't hold_up . 
2677	br-g15	14	37	62073	As the first sentence suggests , both roads belong_to death in_the_end . 
2678	br-g15	14	38	62085	But the highroad , according_to the description of its traffic , belongs_to life as it is lived in unawareness of death , while the way to the churchyard belongs_to some other sort of life : 
2679	br-g15	14	39	62120	a suffering form , an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death . 
2680	br-g15	14	40	62134	Thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldiers `` marched in their own dust and sang '' , while on the footpath one man walks alone . 
2681	br-g15	15	41	62163	This man 's isolation is not merely momentary , it is permanent . 
2682	br-g15	15	42	62176	He is a widower , his three children are dead , he has no_one left on earth ; also he is a drunk , and has lost his job on_that_account . 
2683	br-g15	15	43	62207	His name is Praisegod_Piepsam , and he is rather fully described as_to his clothing and physiognomy in_a_way which relates him to a sinister type in the author 's repertory - he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in `` Death_in_Venice '' , for_example , who represent some combination of cadaver , exotic , and psychopomp . 
2684	br-g15	16	44	62264	This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather_than the highroad . 
2685	br-g15	16	45	62282	The cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as `` Life '' - that and a license_number , which Piepsam uses in addressing him . 
2686	br-g15	16	46	62314	`` Life '' points_out that `` everybody uses this path '' , and starts to ride on . 
2687	br-g15	16	47	62332	Piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` Life '' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather . 
2688	br-g15	16	48	62368	His rage assumes a religious form ; that_is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life - not_only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as_well : `` all you light-headed breed '' . 
2689	br-g15	16	49	62428	This passion brings_on a fit which proves fatal . 
2690	br-g15	16	50	62437	Then an ambulance comes_along , and they drive Praisegod_Piepsam away . 
2691	br-g15	17	51	62448	This is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant . 
2692	br-g15	17	52	62465	The season , between spring and summer , belongs_to life in its carefree aspect . 
2693	br-g15	17	53	62480	Piepsam 's fatal rage arises not_only because he cannot stop the cyclist , but also because God will not stop him ; as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : `` His justice is not of this world '' . 
2694	br-g15	18	54	62523	Life is further characterized , in antithesis to Piepsam , as animal : the image of a dog , which appears at several places , is first given as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle : a dog in a wagon is `` admirable '' , `` a pleasure to contemplate '' ; another wagon has no dog , and therefore is `` devoid_of interest '' . 
2695	br-g15	18	55	62599	Piepsam calls the cyclist `` cur '' and `` puppy '' among other things , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face . 
2696	br-g15	18	56	62633	The ambulance is drawn by two `` charming '' little horses . 
2697	br-g15	19	57	62645	Piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense . 
2698	br-g15	19	58	62657	His religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness ; the two may in_fact be identical . 
2699	br-g15	19	59	62677	His unsuccessful strivings to give_up drink are represented as religious strivings ; he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe Praisegod_Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue - and still in_the_end capitulated '' . 
2700	br-g15	20	60	62729	The cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic Life , `` blithe and carefree '' . 
2701	br-g15	20	61	62752	`` He made no claims to belong_to the great and mighty of this earth '' . 
2702	br-g15	21	62	62768	Piepsam is grotesque , a disturbing parody ; his end is ridiculous and trivial . 
2703	br-g15	21	63	62783	He is `` a man raving_mad on_the_way to the churchyard '' . 
2704	br-g15	21	64	62795	But he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist . 
2705	br-g15	21	65	62824	And if I have gone into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it is also so typical a work , representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann 's writing : 
2706	br-g15	21	66	62865	the crude sketch of Piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for_instance , Naphta and Leverku^hn . 
2707	br-g15	22	67	62898	In method as_well_as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism '' , anticipates a kind of musical_composition , as_well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as Leverku^hn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic '' . 
2708	br-g15	22	68	62951	It resembles , too , pictures such_as Du^rer and Bruegel did , in which all that looks at_first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for_example , or a deadly_sin . 
2709	br-g15	23	69	62993	`` Gladius_Dei '' ( 1902 ) resembles `` The_Way_to_the_Churchyard '' in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between `` Life '' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict . 
2710	br-g15	24	70	63041	The monk Savonarola , brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn_of_the_century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art shop of M._Bluthenzweig ; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according_to gossip , upon the painter 's mistress . 
2711	br-g15	24	71	63096	Hieronymus , like Piepsam , makes his protest quite in_vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating ; he is simply thrown_out of the shop by the porter . 
2712	br-g15	24	72	63131	On the street outside , Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence , and prophetically he issues his curse : `` Gladius_Dei super terram cito et velociter '' . 
2713	br-h01	1	1	63181	The_Office_of_Business_Economics ( OBE ) of the U.S._Department_of_Commerce provides basic measures of the national economy and current analysis of short-run changes in the economic situation and business outlook .

2730	br-h01	9	18	63581	SBA serves also as a clearing_house for information on products and processes particularly adaptable for exploitation by small firms . 
2731	br-h01	9	19	63601	This may be helpful in improving the competitive position of established firms through diversification and expansion or through more economical utilization of plant capacity . 
2732	br-h01	10	20	63626	Production specialists are_available in SBA regional offices to help individual small business_concerns with technical production problems . 
2733	br-h01	10	21	63643	These problems frequently arise where a firm is making items for the Government not directly along the lines of its normal civilian business or where the Government specifications require operations that the firm did not understand when it undertook the contract . 
2734	br-h01	10	22	63685	Production assistance often takes the form of locating tools or materials which are urgently needed . 
2735	br-h01	10	23	63701	Advice is given also on problems of plant location and plant space . 
2736	br-h01	11	24	63714	The property sales assistance program is designed to assist small business_concerns that may wish to buy property offered for sale by the Federal_Government . 
2737	br-h01	11	25	63738	Under this program , property sales specialists in the Small_Business_Administration regional offices help small business_concerns to locate Federal property for_sale and insure that small firms have the opportunity to bid competitively for surplus personal and real_property and certain natural_resources , including timber from the national forests . 
2738	br-h01	12	26	63785	SBA works closely with the principal property disposal installations of the Federal_Government in reviewing proposed sales programs and identifying those types of property that small business_concerns are most likely to be interested in purchasing . 
2739	br-h01	12	27	63820	Proposed property sales of general interest to small business_concerns are publicized through SBA regional news releases , and by `` flyers '' directed to the small business_concerns . 
2740	br-h01	12	28	63848	Each SBA regional office also maintains a `` want '' list of surplus property , principally machinery and equipment , desired by small business_concerns in its area . 
2741	br-h01	12	29	63876	When suitable equipment is_located by the SBA representative , the small business_concern is contacted and advised on when , where , and how to bid on such property . 
2742	br-h01	13	30	63905	Section 8 ( b ) ( 2 ) of the Small_Business_Act , as amended , authorizes the SBA to make a complete inventory of the productive facilities of small business_concerns . 
2743	br-h01	13	31	63936	The Administration maintains a productive facilities inventory of small business industrial concerns that have voluntarily registered . 
2744	br-h01	13	32	63953	It is kept in each Regional office for the small firms within the region . 
2745	br-h01	13	33	63968	Purpose of this inventory is to include all eligible productive facilities in SBA 's facilities register so that the small business_concerns may have an opportunity to avail themselves of the services authorized by the Congress in establishing the Small_Business_Administration . 
2746	br-h01	13	34	64008	These services include procurement and technical assistance and notice of surplus sales and invitations to bid on Government contracts for products and services within the registrants ' field_of_operations .

2752	br-h01	16	40	64205	SBA makes loans to individual small business_firms , providing them with financing when it is not otherwise available through private lending sources on reasonable terms . 
2753	br-h01	16	41	64231	Many such loans have been made to establish small concerns or to aid in their growth , thereby contributing substantially to community development programs . 
2754	br-h01	17	42	64256	SBA loans , which may be made to small manufacturers , small business pools , wholesalers , retailers , service establishments and other small businesses ( when financing is not otherwise available to them on reasonable terms ) , are to finance business construction , conversion , or expansion ; the purchase of equipment , facilities , machinery , supplies , or materials ; or to supply working_capital . 
2755	br-h01	17	43	64325	Evidence that other sources of financing are unavailable must be provided . 
2756	br-h01	18	44	64337	SBA business loans are of two types : `` participation '' and `` direct '' . 
2757	br-h01	18	45	64353	Participation_loans are those made jointly by the SBA and banks or other private lending_institutions . 
2758	br-h01	18	46	64368	Direct_loans are those made by SBA alone . 
2759	br-h01	18	47	64376	To qualify for either type of loan , an applicant must be a small business or approved small business `` pool '' and must meet certain credit requirements . 
2760	br-h01	18	48	64405	A small business is defined as one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field . 
2761	br-h01	18	49	64427	In_addition , the SBA uses such criteria as number of employees and dollar_volume of the business . 
2762	br-h01	19	50	64444	The credit requirements stipulate that the applicant must have the ability to operate the business successfully and have enough capital in the business so that , with loan assistance from the SBA , it will be able to operate on a sound financial basis . 
2763	br-h01	19	51	64489	A proposed loan must be for sound purposes or sufficiently secured so_as to assure a reasonable chance of repayment . 
2764	br-h01	19	52	64509	The record of past earnings and prospects for the future must indicate it has the ability to repay the loan out of current and anticipated income . 
2765	br-h01	20	53	64536	The amount which may be borrowed from the SBA depends_on how much is required to carry_out the intended purpose of the loan . 
2766	br-h01	20	54	64559	The maximum loan which SBA may make to any one borrower is $ 350000 . 
2767	br-h01	20	55	64574	Business loans generally are repayable in regular installments - usually monthly , including interest at the rate of 5 - 1/2 percent per_annum on the unpaid balance - and have a maximum maturity of 10 years ; the term of loans for working_capital is 6 years .

2771	br-h01	23	59	64721	The Farm_Credit_Administration , an independent agency located within the Department_of_Agriculture , supervises and coordinates a cooperative credit_system for agriculture . 
2772	br-h01	23	60	64741	The system is composed of three credit services , Federal_Land_Banks and National_Farm_Loan_Associations , Federal_Intermediate ( short-term ) Credit_Banks , and Banks_for_Cooperatives . 
2773	br-h01	23	61	64763	This system provides long - and short-term credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing , purchasing , and business service organizations . 
2774	br-h01	24	62	64785	As a source of investment capital , the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages the development of industries in rural_areas . 
2775	br-h01	24	63	64808	The credit provdied by the first two services in the system outlined above is primarily for general agricultural purposes . 
2776	br-h01	24	64	64828	The third credit service , Banks_for_Cooperatives , exists under authority of the Farm_Credit_Act_of_1933 . 
2777	br-h01	24	65	64842	The Banks_for_Cooperatives were established to provide a permanent source of credit on a sound basis for farmers ' cooperatives . 
2778	br-h01	25	66	64862	Three distinct classes of loans are made available to farmers ' cooperatives by the Banks_for_Cooperatives : 
2779	br-h01	25	67	64878	Commodity loans , operating_capital loans , and facility loans . 
2780	br-h01	26	68	64888	To be eligible to borrow from a Bank_for_Cooperatives , a cooperative must be an association in which farmers act together in processing and marketing farm products , purchasing farm supplies , or furnishing farm business services , and must meet the requirements set_forth in the Farm_Credit_Act_of_1933 , as amended . 
2781	br-h01	27	69	64938	Interest_rates are determined by the board_of_directors of the bank with the approval of the Farm_Credit_Administration .

2784	br-h01	30	72	65001	To encourage exploration for domestic sources of minerals , the Office_of_Minerals_Exploration ( OME ) of the U.S._Department_of_the_Interior offers financial assistance to firms and individuals who desire to explore their properties or claims for 1 or more of the 32 mineral commodities listed in the OME regulations . 
2785	br-h01	31	73	65048	This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds from commercial sources on reasonable terms . 
2786	br-h01	31	74	65084	Each applicant is required to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored . 
2787	br-h01	31	75	65101	The Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up_to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses . 
2788	br-h01	31	76	65124	The applicant pays the rest of the cost , but his own time spent on the work and charges for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied toward his share of the cost . 
2789	br-h01	32	77	65161	Funds contributed by the Government are repaid by a royalty on production from the property . 
2790	br-h01	32	78	65177	If nothing is produced , there is no obligation to repay . 
2791	br-h01	32	79	65189	A 5 - percent royalty is paid on any production during the period the contract is in_effect ; if the Government certifies that production may be possible from the property , the royalty obligation continues for the 10 - year period usually specified in the contract or until the Government 's contribution is repaid with interest . 
2792	br-h01	32	80	65246	The royalty applies to both principal and interest , but it never exceeds 5 percent . 
2793	br-h01	33	81	65262	Information , application_forms , and assistance in filing may be obtained from the Office_of_Minerals_Exploration , U.S._Department_of_the_Interior , Washington 25 , D.C. , or from the appropriate regional office listed below : 
2794	br-j01	1	1	65293	It has recently become practical to use the radio_emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres . 
2795	br-j01	1	2	65320	The results of present observations of the thermal radio_emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared_emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . 
2796	br-j01	1	3	65363	When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon . 
2797	br-j01	2	4	65395	Observations of the radio_emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to_a_greater_extent than those using shorter wave_lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface . 
2798	br-j01	2	5	65434	Radio_observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . 
2799	br-j01	2	6	65453	The observed intensity of the radio_emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave_lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black_body at about 600 ` K . 
2800	br-j01	2	7	65496	This result suggests a very high_temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black_body merely by coincidence . 
2801	br-j01	2	8	65544	For the case of Jupiter , the radio_emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal components . 
2802	br-j01	3	9	65589	Of the remaining planets , only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio_sources , and not very much information is available . 
2803	br-j01	3	10	65612	Mars has been observed twice at about 3 - cm wave_length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars . 
2804	br-j01	3	11	65653	The low intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations , but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin . 
2805	br-j01	3	12	65679	No attempts to measure the radio_emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low_temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave_lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity . 
2806	br-j01	3	13	65727	In_spite of this , the very large radio_reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio_emission of most of the planets in a_few years . 
2807	br-j01	4	14	65761	The study of the radio_emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25 - cm wave_length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) . 
2808	br-j01	4	15	65795	This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25 - cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . 
2809	br-j01	4	16	65825	They deduced from their measurements that the radio_emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less_than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared_emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio_emission came about 3 - 1 2 days after Full_Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared_emission , which reaches its maximum at Full_Moon . 
2810	br-j01	4	17	65915	Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing_out that rocklike materials which are likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_waves , although opaque to infrared_radiation . 
2811	br-j01	4	18	65948	The infrared_emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase . 
2812	br-j01	4	19	65989	Since the absorption of radio_waves in rocklike material varies with wave_length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material . 
2813	br-j01	5	20	66031	The radio_emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when Burke and Franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of interference like radio_noise on their records at about 15 meters wave_length as emission from Jupiter . 
2814	br-j01	5	21	66069	This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) . 
2815	br-j01	5	22	66090	Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) . 
2816	br-j01	5	23	66150	In the relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave_lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 cm . 
2817	br-j01	6	24	66191	The observable characteristics of planetary radio_radiation are the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the waves . 
2818	br-j01	6	25	66213	The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute_of_arc . 
2819	br-j01	6	26	66231	This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio_emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved . 
2820	br-j01	6	27	66263	It should be possible , however , to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio_sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers . 
2821	br-j01	6	28	66289	Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth . 
2822	br-j01	6	29	66315	There have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation . 
2823	br-j01	6	30	66331	The measurements made with the NRL 50 - foot reflector , which is altitude azimuth mounted , would have shown a systematic change with local hour_angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized . 
2824	br-j01	6	31	66377	Recent interferometer measurements ( Radhakrishnan and Roberts , 1960 ) have shown the 960 - Mc emission of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate_in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk . 
2825	br-j01	6	32	66413	Other_than this very significant result , most_of the information now available about the radio_emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation . 
2826	br-j01	7	33	66439	The concept of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets . 
2827	br-j01	7	34	66459	The received radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black-body which subtends the same solid_angle as the visible disk of the planet . 
2828	br-j01	7	35	66484	The apparent black-body disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black_body in_order_that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation . 
2829	br-j01	7	36	66513	The use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really radiates as a black_body , will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material . 
2830	br-j01	8	37	66553	The radio_radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal_emission at centimeter wave_lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio_noise . 
2831	br-j01	8	38	66588	The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar_radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1 ` K . 
2832	br-j01	8	39	66609	At meter wave_lengths and increase of the order of 10 ` K in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected . 
2833	br-j01	8	40	66634	Therefore , neglecting the extreme outbursts , reflected solar_radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter - and decimeter wave-length range . 
2834	br-j01	9	41	66665	Radio_observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave_lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1 . 
2835	br-j01	9	42	66693	Observations have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( Sinton , 1955 , 1956 , ; see_also chap. 11 ) . 
2836	br-j01	9	43	66717	Not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data , and this , together with differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers , must account_for much of the disagreement in the measured radio_brightness temperatures . 
2837	br-j01	10	44	66769	In the observations at 4.3 mm ( Coates , 1959 a ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6 ' .7 , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases . 
2838	br-j01	10	45	66826	These observations indicate that the lunar maria heat_up more rapidly and also cool_off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions . 
2839	br-j01	10	46	66847	Mare_Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it . 
2840	br-j01	10	47	66863	These contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio_brightness with latitude . 
2841	br-j01	11	48	66878	Very recently , observations have been made at 8 - mm wave_length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2 ' ( Amenitskii , Noskova , and Salomonovich , 1960 ) . 
2842	br-j01	11	49	66918	The constant temperature contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates ( 1959 a ) , and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features . 
2843	br-j01	11	50	66956	Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave_lengths in_order_that the radio_emission of the moon can be properly interpreted . 
2844	br-j01	12	51	66977	The observations of Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described . 
2845	br-j01	12	52	67006	Measurements at 3.15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to June 19 , 1956 , using the 50 - foot reflector at the U.S._Naval_Research_Laboratory in Washington . 
2846	br-j01	12	53	67039	The half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam was about 9 ' , and the angle subtended by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes . 
2847	br-j01	12	54	67071	The antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 b ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid_angle of the moon was known . 
2848	br-j01	12	55	67118	The ratio of the measured antenna temperature_change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 . 
2849	br-j01	12	56	67172	The measured brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon 's disk is nearly uniform . 
2850	br-j01	12	57	67215	The result of the observations is ( in ` K ) **f where the phase angle , |qt , is measured in degrees from new_moon and the probable errors include absolute as_well_as relative errors . 
2851	br-j01	12	58	67250	This result is plotted along with the 8.6 - mm observations of Gibson ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , a . 
2852	br-j01	12	59	67272	The variation in the 3 - cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very_much less_than the variation in the 8.6 - mm emission , as would be expected from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) . 
2853	br-j01	12	60	67313	In the discussion which follows , the time average of the radio_emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component . 
2854	br-j01	13	61	67346	The 10.3 - cm observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 , 1958 , using the 84 - foot reflector at the Maryland_Point_Observatory of the U.S._Naval_Research_Laboratory . 
2855	br-j01	13	62	67374	The age of the moon was about 2 days . 
2856	br-j01	13	63	67384	The half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about 18 ' .5 , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a Gaussian_shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon . 
2857	br-j02	1	1	67423	Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . 
2858	br-j02	1	2	67444	Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . 
2859	br-j02	1	3	67463	It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy A detailed energy balance of the anode was established . 
2860	br-j02	1	4	67503	The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . 
2861	br-j02	1	5	67514	The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Amp . 
2862	br-j02	1	6	67544	Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion_pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities . 
2863	br-j02	2	7	67566	The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation . 
2864	br-j02	2	8	67586	The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode . 
2865	br-j02	2	9	67596	In free_burning electric arcs , for_instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving_rise to local heat fluxes in excess of **f as measured by the authors - the exact value depending_on the arc atmosphere . 
2866	br-j02	2	10	67639	In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high_temperature research tools often more than 50 % of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode . 
2867	br-j02	3	11	67675	The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical_phenomena occurring in free_burning arcs . 
2868	br-j02	3	12	67700	In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat . 
2869	br-j02	3	13	67713	The heat transfer to the anode is_due to the following effects : 1 . 
2870	br-j02	3	14	67727	Heat_of_condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic_energy of the electrons impinging_on the anode . 
2871	br-j02	3	15	67741	This energy transfer depends_on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode sheath . 
2872	br-j02	3	16	67767	2 . 
2873	br-j02	3	17	67769	Heat transfer by molecular conduction as_well_as by radiation from the arc column . 
2874	br-j02	4	18	67782	The heat transfer to the anode in free_burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas_jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up **f . 
2875	br-j02	4	19	67809	This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in_detail by Maecker ( Ref. 1 ) . 
2876	br-j02	4	20	67823	The pressure gradient producing the jet is_due to the nature of the magnetic_field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) . 
2877	br-j02	4	21	67852	Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free_burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point . 
2878	br-j02	5	22	67870	it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free_burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode . 
2879	br-j02	5	23	67899	The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions ; however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux . 
2880	br-j02	5	24	67925	An attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss . 
2881	br-j02	5	25	67954	The following possibilities exist for achieving this : 1 . 
2882	br-j02	5	26	67964	The use of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output . 
2883	br-j02	5	27	67989	2 . 
2884	br-j02	5	28	67991	Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic_forces . 
2885	br-j02	5	29	68006	3 . 
2886	br-j02	5	30	68008	Feed_back of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode . 
2887	br-j02	6	31	68024	The third method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for_the_first_time by C._Sheer and co-workers ( Ref. 2 ) . 
2888	br-j02	6	32	68045	The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as_well_as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage . 
2889	br-j02	6	33	68078	Gas injection through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not_only feeds_back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself . 
2890	br-j02	6	34	68112	A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper . 
2891	br-j02	6	35	68126	Argon was used as a blowing_gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical_reaction . 
2892	br-j02	6	36	68141	The anode material was porous graphite . 
2893	br-j02	6	37	68148	Sintered porous metals should be usable in_principle . 
2894	br-j02	6	38	68156	However , technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots . 
2895	br-j02	6	39	68168	The experimental arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free_burning arcs . 
2896	br-j02	6	40	68183	Thus , direct comparisons can be drawn with free_burning arcs which have been studied in_detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( Ref. 3 ) . 
2897	br-j02	7	41	68212	Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder . 
2898	br-j02	7	42	68235	The cathode consisted_of a 1/4 '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water_cooled copper tube . 
2899	br-j02	7	43	68252	This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing . 
2900	br-j02	7	44	68272	The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk . 
2901	br-j02	7	45	68295	The transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below . 
2902	br-j02	7	46	68312	Inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2 . 
2903	br-j02	7	47	68330	Argon was also blown at low velocities ( mass flow_rate **f ) through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air . 
2904	br-j02	7	48	68361	The anode consisted_of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite plug , 1/4 inch long . 
2905	br-j02	7	49	68376	The graphite was National_Carbon_NC 60 , which has a porosity of 50 % and an average pore size of 30 This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode . 
2906	br-j02	7	50	68412	The anode plug ( Figure 2 ) was inserted into a carbon anode holder . 
2907	br-j02	7	51	68427	A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas . 
2908	br-j02	7	52	68442	It was exposed to a high velocity gas_jet . 
2909	br-j02	7	53	68451	A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts . 
2910	br-j02	7	54	68473	This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection . 
2911	br-j02	7	55	68490	Two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2 ( Pyrometer_Instrument_Co. Model 95 ) served for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder . 
2912	br-j02	7	56	68521	Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature . 
2913	br-j02	8	57	68541	Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3 . 
2914	br-j02	8	58	68554	In this design the anode holder is water_cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant . 
2915	br-j02	8	59	68582	To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the region of the arc , a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder . 
2916	br-j02	8	60	68627	In_addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum_foil to reduce radiation . 
2917	br-j02	8	61	68644	Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water_cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account_for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug . 
2918	br-j02	9	62	68676	The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator . 
2919	br-j02	9	63	68696	The power source was a commercial D.C. rectifier . 
2920	br-j02	9	64	68705	At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less_than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load . 
2921	br-j02	9	65	68726	The current was regulated by_means_of a variable_resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter . 
2922	br-j02	9	66	68743	The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders . 
2923	br-j02	9	67	68762	Because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast_resistor was required for stability of operation . 
2924	br-j02	9	68	68780	A high_frequency starter was used to start the arc . 
2925	br-j02	10	69	68790	The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind . 
2926	br-j02	10	70	68805	The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as_far_as_possible and they should be such_that an accurate heat balance can be made . 
2927	br-j02	10	71	68829	In_order to reduce the number of variable parameters , all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.5 '' and a current of 100 Amp . 
2928	br-j02	10	72	68857	The argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between **f . 
2929	br-j02	10	73	68870	and **f . 
2930	br-j02	10	74	68873	The lower_limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow_rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable . 
2931	br-j02	10	75	68907	The upper_limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc . 
2932	br-j02	10	76	68939	This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously . 
2933	br-j02	11	77	68959	For each mass flow_rate the arc voltage was measured . 
2934	br-j02	11	78	68969	To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scanned with a pyrometer . 
2935	br-j02	11	79	68987	As it turned_out , a very hot region occurred on the plug . 
2936	br-j02	11	80	69000	Its temperature was denoted by **f . 
2937	br-j02	11	81	69007	The size of this hot region was estimated by eye . 
2938	br-j02	11	82	69018	The rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug . 
2939	br-j02	11	83	69036	The mean temperature of this region was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug . 
2940	br-j02	11	84	69063	It was denoted by **f . 
2941	br-j02	11	85	69069	The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation : **f where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot . 
2942	br-j02	11	86	69100	Assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon , the gas enthalpy rise through the anode was calculated according_to the relation **f whereby the specific_heat of argon was taken as **f . 
2943	br-j02	11	87	69135	This calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross_section whereas in_reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures . 
2944	br-j02	12	88	69175	The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple shown in figure 2 was **f . 
2945	br-j02	12	89	69190	The **f values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages . 
2946	br-j02	12	90	69208	Simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2 . 
2947	br-j02	12	91	69236	Some of these temperatures are plotted in figure 4 . 
2948	br-j02	12	92	69246	They showed no marked dependence on the flow_rate within the accuracy of these measurements . 
2949	br-j02	12	93	69261	Thus , the dotted line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates . 
2950	br-j02	13	94	69283	The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of **f . 
2951	br-j02	13	95	69303	This temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as_far_as radiation is concerned . 
2952	br-j02	13	96	69322	It is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder , to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements . 
2953	br-j02	13	97	69358	The reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry . 
2954	br-j02	13	98	69396	The total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts . 
2955	br-j02	13	99	69422	It was calculated from the temperature_gradient **f at **f inch as **f . 
2956	br-j02	13	100	69435	The total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby **f The temperature distribution of figure 4 gives **f for all blowing rates , assuming **f . 
2957	br-j02	13	101	69466	The temperature dependent value of |e was taken from Ref. 7 . 
2958	br-j02	13	102	69478	The radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according_to **f where **f is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures **f and **f calculated analogously to equation ( 1 ) . 
2959	br-j03	1	1	69512	A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . 
2960	br-j03	1	2	69521	It consists_of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims . 
2961	br-j03	1	3	69533	There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed . 
2962	br-j03	1	4	69553	A tape of cellulose_acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks . 
2963	br-j03	1	5	69580	In normal use weights are hung_on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks . 
2964	br-j03	1	6	69607	After it has reached terminal_velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded . 
2965	br-j03	1	7	69626	By the use of various weights , data for a force rate of shear graph can be obtained . 
2966	br-j03	1	8	69645	The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described . 
2967	br-j03	2	9	69660	In this test a * * f tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of * * f with a clearance of 0.002 '' on each side of the tape . 
2968	br-j03	2	10	69698	This gives a rate of shear of * * f . 
2969	br-j03	2	11	69709	This , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs . 
2970	br-j03	2	12	69745	The face of one block contained a hole 1 16 '' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure . 
2971	br-j03	3	13	69771	Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types . 
2972	br-j03	3	14	69789	Two of the fluids showed a high positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in_comparison_with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two . 
2973	br-j03	4	15	69825	Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure . 
2974	br-j03	4	16	69846	Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built_up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate . 
2975	br-j03	4	17	69900	A system had_to be used which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time . 
2976	br-j03	4	18	69932	A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . 
2977	br-j03	4	19	69966	By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular_weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere . 
2978	br-j03	4	20	69995	The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper_limit of the apparatus on_hand . 
2979	br-j03	5	21	70013	The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular_weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 . 
2980	br-j03	5	22	70035	These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular_weight . 
2981	br-j03	5	23	70055	The maximum suction was 3.25 '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids . 
2982	br-j03	5	24	70082	It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus . 
2983	br-j03	5	25	70122	This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head * * f since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes . 
2984	br-j03	6	26	70148	These experiments can be considered exploratory only . 
2985	br-j03	6	27	70156	However , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper . 
2986	br-j03	6	28	70188	They also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures . 
2987	br-j03	6	29	70211	Such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as_well_as theoretical studies . 
2988	br-j03	6	30	70228	The elasticity as a parameter of fluids which is not subject_to simple measurement at_present , and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials . 
2989	br-j03	6	31	70261	Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such_as printing_inks , paints , adhesives , molten plastics , and bread_dough , for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length '' , `` shortness '' , `` spinnability '' , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods at_present . 
2990	br-j03	7	32	70328	The actual change * * f caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume , just_as_it_is for any gravitational or osmotic_pressure head . 
2991	br-j03	7	33	70358	If the volume is the molal volume , then * * f is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists . 
2992	br-j03	8	34	70385	Although the * * f calculation is obvious by_analogy_with that for gravitational_field and osmotic_pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects . 
2993	br-j03	8	35	70418	Consider a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of h ( referred to the same base as H ) and a cross-sectional area of a . 
2994	br-j03	8	36	70458	If * * f is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and |r is the density of the fluid , then the total potential_energy of the system above the reference height is * * f . 
2995	br-j03	8	37	70507	* * f is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h . 
2996	br-j03	8	38	70526	The total volume of the system above the reference height is * * f , and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential_energy of the system in_terms_of H . 
2997	br-j03	8	39	70560	The minimum total potential_energy is found by taking the derivative with_respect_to H and equating to zero . 
2998	br-j03	8	40	70577	This gives * * f , which is the pressure . 
2999	br-j03	8	41	70588	This is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential_energy for equilibrium . 
3000	br-j03	8	42	70612	This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields . 
3001	br-j03	8	43	70627	The relation between osmotic_pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way . 
3002	br-j03	9	44	70644	In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics_of_equilibrium ( referred to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state . 
3003	br-j03	9	45	70666	This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared . 
3004	br-j03	9	46	70689	This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' . 
3005	br-j03	9	47	70716	There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed_out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar . 
3006	br-j03	9	48	70760	If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar . 
3007	br-j03	10	49	70778	The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference * * f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear . 
3008	br-j03	10	50	70816	Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45 ` to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear . 
3009	br-j03	10	51	70862	According_to Philippoff , the recoverable shear s is given by * * f where |c is the angle_of_extinction . 
3010	br-j03	10	52	70881	From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the * * f calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face . 
3011	br-j03	11	53	70918	There is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as_such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields . 
3012	br-j03	11	54	70962	These droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one 's hands . 
3013	br-j03	11	55	70987	These droplets appear to be ellipsoids , and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are . 
3014	br-j03	11	56	71005	If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation . 
3015	br-j03	11	57	71019	The direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of_course , given by the direction of the major_axis of the ellipsoids . 
3016	br-j03	11	58	71042	Mason and Taylor both show that the major_axis of the ellipsoids is at 45 ` at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear . 
3017	br-j03	11	59	71076	( Some suspensions break_up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup . ) 
3018	br-j03	11	60	71100	This is , of_course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies . 
3019	br-j03	11	61	71117	The relative forces can be calculated from the various radii_of_curvature if we assume : ( A ) The surface_tension is uniform on the surface of the drop . 
3020	br-j03	11	62	71145	( B ) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions . 
3021	br-j03	11	63	71168	( C ) The kinetic effects are negligible . 
3022	br-j03	11	64	71177	( D ) Since the shape of the drop conforms_to the force field , it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid . 
3023	br-j03	12	65	71204	These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear . 
3024	br-j03	12	66	71226	Just as the pressure exerted by surface_tension in a spherical drop is * * f and the pressure exerted by surface_tension on a cylindrical shape is * * f , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is * * f , where |g is the interfacial_tension and * * f and * * f are the two radii_of_curvature . 
3025	br-j03	12	67	71286	This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason . 
3026	br-j03	12	68	71295	If a is the major_axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes , the radius_of_curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis is * * f , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is * * f . 
3027	br-j03	13	69	71346	There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas . 
3028	br-j03	13	70	71367	However , there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol_phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn_syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok . 
3029	br-j03	13	71	71396	This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of_course , not negligible . 
3030	br-j03	13	72	71411	Measurements on the photograph in this paper give * * f at the maximum rate of shear of * * f . 
3031	br-j03	13	73	71433	If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of * * f , cosec 2lc applies , the pressure difference along the major_axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major_axis , and from this the interfacial_tension can be calculated . 
3032	br-j03	13	74	71479	Its value was * * f from the above data . 
3033	br-j03	13	75	71490	This appears to be high , as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops . 
3034	br-j03	14	76	71511	It is appropriate to call_attention_to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal_gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation . 
3035	br-j03	14	77	71529	The internal energy of an ideal_gas depends_on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume . 
3036	br-j03	14	78	71546	In_other_words , if an ideal_gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat_sink . 
3037	br-j03	14	79	71577	This means that work equals q which in_turn equals * * f . 
3038	br-j03	15	80	71590	There is a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that * * f , where \q is the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal_gas ) could be reached by chance alone . 
3039	br-j03	15	81	71628	this is known as conformational_entropy . 
3040	br-j03	15	82	71634	This conformational_entropy is , in this case , equal to the usual entropy , for there are no other changes or other energies involved . 
3041	br-j03	15	83	71659	Note that though the ideal_gas itself contains no additional energy , the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure . 
3042	br-j03	15	84	71679	The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect_gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings . 
3043	br-j04	1	1	71698	A proton_magnetic_resonance study of polycrystalline **f as a function of magnetic_field and temperature is presented . 
3044	br-j04	1	2	71714	**f is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as_well_as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening . 
3045	br-j04	1	3	71731	The lines are asymmetric and over the range of field **f gauss and temperature **f the asymmetry increases with increasing **f and decreasing T . 
3046	br-j04	1	4	71756	An isotropic resonance shift of **f to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . 
3047	br-j04	1	5	71774	The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second_moment **f of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to **f . 
3048	br-j04	1	6	71802	The theory predicts a linear dependence of **f on **f , where |j is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant . 
3049	br-j04	1	7	71822	The experimental second_moment **f conforms_to the relation **f in_agreement with theory . 
3050	br-j04	1	8	71834	Hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) . 
3051	br-j04	1	9	71854	The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes . 
3052	br-j04	1	10	71866	The nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei , but the symmetry of the **f bond in **f remains in doubt . 
3053	br-j04	2	11	71894	The magnetic_moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic_resonance properties of nuclei . 
3054	br-j04	2	12	71914	It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear_resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure . 
3055	br-j04	2	13	71936	**f appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters , since it is a normal paramagnet , with three unpaired electrons on the chromium , its crystal structure is very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong **f bond provides structural interest . 
3056	br-j04	3	14	71987	We first discuss the **f bond in **f . 
3057	br-j04	3	15	71996	We then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment . 
3058	br-j04	3	16	72021	Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects . 
3059	br-j04	3	17	72033	The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in_terms_of various motional modified models of the **f bond in **f . 
3060	br-j04	4	18	72064	Theoretical studies of the hydrogen_bond generally agree that the **f bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarities of packing in the solid . 
3061	br-j04	4	19	72089	Moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical **f distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric . 
3062	br-j04	4	20	72111	There is ample evidence from many sources that the **f bond in **f is symmetric . 
3063	br-j04	4	21	72127	The **f distance in **f is 2.26 A . 
3064	br-j04	4	22	72136	There is evidence , though less convincing than for **f , that the **f bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric . 
3065	br-j04	4	23	72157	Here the **f distance is 2.44 A . 
3066	br-j04	4	24	72165	A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the **f bond becomes symmetric when the **f bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A , but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports of symmetric **f bonds . 
3067	br-j04	4	25	72215	Douglass has studied the crystal structure of **f by x-ray_diffraction . 
3068	br-j04	4	26	72226	He finds the structure contains an **f bond with the **f distance of **f . 
3069	br-j04	4	27	72241	There is , then , the possibility that this **f bond is symmetric , although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data . 
3070	br-j04	5	28	72268	Douglass found **f to be trigonal , Laue symmetry **f , with **f , **f . 
3071	br-j04	5	29	72284	X-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit_cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of **f . 
3072	br-j04	5	30	72305	The x-ray data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group , but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry . 
3073	br-j04	5	31	72334	Under this assumption the space group must be **f and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit_cell . 
3074	br-j04	5	32	72356	**f . 
3075	br-j04	5	33	72358	This space group requires the hydrogen_bond to be symmetric . 
3076	br-j04	5	34	72368	Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for **f . 
3077	br-j04	5	35	72381	These data lead to a structure in which sheets of Cr atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms . 
3078	br-j04	5	36	72401	The O atoms in each sheet are close_packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms . 
3079	br-j04	5	37	72423	The **f layers are stacked normal to the [ 111 ] axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers . 
3080	br-j04	5	38	72465	The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen_bonds . 
3081	br-j04	5	39	72474	A drawing of the structure is to be_found in reference 6 . 
3082	br-j04	6	40	72486	The gross details of the structure appear reasonable . 
3083	br-j04	6	41	72495	The structure appears to be unique among ROOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by **f . 
3084	br-j04	6	42	72515	The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal . 
3085	br-j04	6	43	72535	However , the possible absence of a center of symmetry not_only moves the hydrogen_atom off **f , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent , with **f at **f and **f at **f ( space group **f ) , where **f represents the oxygens on one side of the **f layers and **f those on the other side . 
3086	br-j04	6	44	72596	However , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short **f interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non hydrogen_bonded **f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 A . 
3087	br-j04	6	45	72630	Hence it is difficult to conceive_of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence . 
3088	br-j04	6	46	72655	The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen_atoms to occupy general , rather_than special , positions along the [ 111 ] axis . 
3089	br-j04	7	47	72685	If the **f bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen_atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen_atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen_atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ( 3 ) hydrogen_atoms are asymmetrically placed , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen_atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms . 
3090	br-j04	7	48	72782	Position ( 2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in_view_of the absence of a piezoelectric_effect and on general chemical structural grounds . 
3091	br-j04	7	49	72805	A randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen_atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit_cell , for which no evidence exists . 
3092	br-j04	7	50	72874	Therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen_atoms are located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 ) . 
3093	br-j04	8	51	72900	Douglass prepared his sample of **f by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic_acid at 300 - 325 ` C . 
3094	br-j04	8	52	72919	Dr._Douglass was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams of his material . 
3095	br-j04	8	53	72933	This material proved to be unsatisfactory , since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample . 
3096	br-j04	8	54	72954	Subsequently , we learned from Douglass that his sample contained a_few percent **f impurity . 
3097	br-j04	8	55	72969	Since **f is ferromagnetic , we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated **f would be suspect . 
3098	br-j04	9	56	72989	Plane suggested another preparation of **f which we used here . 
3099	br-j04	9	57	73000	500 ml of 1 M aqueous **f with 1 g **f added are heated in a bomb at 170 ` C for 48 hours . 
3100	br-j04	9	58	73025	A very fine , gray solid ( about 15 g ) is formed , water-washed by centrifugation , and dried at 110 ` C . 
3101	br-j04	10	59	73050	Differential thermal analysis showed a very small endothermic_reaction at 340 ` C and a large endothermic_reaction at 470 ` C . 
3102	br-j04	10	60	73071	This latter reaction is in_accord with the reported decomposition of **f . 
3103	br-j04	10	61	73083	Thermogravimetric analysis showed a weight loss of 1.8 % centered at 337 ` C and another weight loss of 10.8 % at 463 ` C . 
3104	br-j04	10	62	73109	The expected weight loss for **f going_to **f and **f is 10.6 % . 
3105	br-j04	10	63	73123	Mass_spectrometric analysis of gases evolved upon heating to 410 ` C indicated nitrogen_oxides and water_vapor . 
3106	br-j04	10	64	73139	The small reaction occurring at 337 ` C is probably caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates , and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other_than **f . 
3107	br-j04	10	65	73169	All subsequent measurements were made on material which had been heated to 375 ` C for one hour . 
3108	br-j04	10	66	73188	Emission_spectra indicated **f calcium and all other impurities much lower . 
3109	br-j04	10	67	73199	Chromium analysis gave 58.8 % Cr as compared with 61.2 % theory . 
3110	br-j04	10	68	73212	However , **f adsorbs water from the atmosphere and this may account_for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss . 
3111	br-j04	11	69	73234	The x-ray_diffraction pattern of the material , taken with CuKla radiation , indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass . 
3112	br-j04	11	70	73264	Magnetic analyses by R._G._Meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities . 
3113	br-j04	11	71	73276	**f was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of **f , where **f . 
3114	br-j04	11	72	73299	For exactly three unpaired electrons the coefficient would be 3.10 . 
3115	br-j04	11	73	73310	An infrared_spectrum , obtained by H._A._Benesi and R._G._Snyder of this laboratory , showed bands in the positions found by Jones . 
3116	br-j04	12	74	73331	Electron_microscopic examination of the **f sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.3 lm in diameter . 
3117	br-j04	12	75	73352	The particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single crystal domains are smaller than this . 
3118	br-j04	12	76	73367	The x-ray data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 A or greater . 
3119	br-j04	12	77	73381	We found no obvious effects due_to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron_microscopic examination . 
3120	br-j04	13	78	73411	The magnetic_resonance absorption was detected by employing a Varian model **f broad line spectrometer and the associated 12 - inch electromagnet system . 
3121	br-j04	13	79	73434	One measurement at 40 Mc / sec was obtained with the Varian model **f unit . 
3122	br-j04	13	80	73450	A bridged-T type of bridge was used in the 10 - 16 Mc / sec range . 
3123	br-j04	13	81	73467	The rf power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions by saturation effects . 
3124	br-j04	13	82	73488	A modulation frequency of 40 cps with an amplitude as small as possible , commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality , was used . 
3125	br-j04	13	83	73512	Background spectra were obtained in all cases . 
3126	br-j04	13	84	73520	The spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mixed_in with the absorption signal . 
3127	br-j04	14	85	73537	A single value of the thermal relaxation_time **f at room_temperature was measured by the progressive saturation method . 
3128	br-j04	14	86	73555	The value of **f estimated at 470 gauss was **f microseconds . 
3129	br-j04	14	87	73567	A single measurement of the spin spin relaxation_time **f was obtained at 10 Mc / sec by pulse methods . 
3130	br-j04	14	88	73587	This measurement was obtained by W._Blumberg of the University_of_California,Berkeley , by observing the breadth of the free induction decay signal . 
3131	br-j04	14	89	73608	The value derived was 16 microseconds . 
3132	br-j04	15	90	73615	Field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line , defined as the field about which the first_moment is zero . 
3133	br-j04	16	91	73639	Second_moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration . 
3134	br-j04	16	92	73649	Corrections were applied for modulation broadening , apparatus background , and field shift . 
3135	br-j04	17	93	73663	Spectra were obtained over the temperature range of 77 - 294 ` K . 
3136	br-j04	17	94	73677	For the low-temperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and Eades . 
3137	br-j04	17	95	73700	The temperature was maintained to within about **f for the period_of_time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) . 
3138	br-j04	17	96	73723	One sample , which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375 ` C , showed the presence of adsorbed water ( about 0.3 wt % ) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room_temperature and which disappeared , due_to broadening , at low_temperature . 
3139	br-j04	17	97	73775	The data reported here are either from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples evacuated and sealed_off at 375 ` C which contain no adsorbed water . 
3140	br-j04	18	98	73811	The measured powder density of the **f used here was about **f , approximately one-third that of the crystal density ( **f ) . 
3141	br-j04	18	99	73835	Such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about **f . 
3142	br-j04	19	100	73848	Spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height to diameter ratio of 4 : 1 . 
3143	br-j04	19	101	73874	The top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical . 
3144	br-j04	19	102	73887	Spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube . 
3145	br-j04	19	103	73914	The bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary . 
3146	br-j04	19	104	73936	Spectra were also obtained from a third sample of **f which had been diluted to three_times its original volume with powdered , anhydrous alundum ( **f ) . 
3147	br-j04	19	105	73964	This sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above . 
3148	br-j05	1	1	73978	Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . 
3149	br-j05	2	2	74020	The market today for detergent_builders is quite diverse . 
3150	br-j05	2	3	74029	The best_known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use . 
3151	br-j05	2	4	74047	These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up_to 50 % by weight of sodium_tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium_tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium_pyrophosphate . 
3152	br-j05	2	5	74089	In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; and the dwindling built soap_powders as_well_as soap_flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised . 
3153	br-j05	2	6	74139	A well publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid_detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder / active ratio . 
3154	br-j05	3	7	74179	Hard surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork . 
3155	br-j05	3	8	74218	The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders . 
3156	br-j05	3	9	74231	In_addition , many of the hard surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium_orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products . 
3157	br-j05	3	10	74263	Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates . 
3158	br-j05	3	11	74271	These hard surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28 . 
3159	br-j05	4	12	74281	Cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces . 
3160	br-j05	4	13	74292	Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be removed , and the detergent or surface-active material . 
3161	br-j05	4	14	74315	An oversimplified differentiation between soft - and hard surface cleaning lies_in the magnitude and kind of surface involved . 
3162	br-j05	4	15	74334	One gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface_area of * * f . 
3163	br-j05	4	16	74351	In contrast , a metal coupon * * f in size would have a magnitude from 100000 to a_million less . 
3164	br-j05	4	17	74372	Even here there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity . 
3165	br-j05	4	18	74395	Spring used a Brush surface analyzer in a metal cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending_upon surface roughness . 
3166	br-j05	4	19	74418	There are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard surface cleaning . 
3167	br-j05	4	20	74432	Exclusive of esthetic values , such_as high - or low foam level , perfume content , etc. , the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high . 
3168	br-j05	4	21	74463	No matter how they are formulated , a large_number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal . 
3169	br-j05	4	22	74492	This is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation . 
3170	br-j05	4	23	74513	A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings ; whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a build-up of `` tattle-tale_grey '' and dirty spots - sometimes with bad results even after the first wash . 
3171	br-j05	4	24	74557	Since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of detergents . 
3172	br-j05	4	25	74582	Harris has indicated that two devices , the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent testing , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics . 
3173	br-j05	4	26	74613	Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use . 
3174	br-j05	4	27	74624	The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash . 
3175	br-j05	4	28	74659	In this way , numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance ( whiteness ) of the cloth swatches before and after washing . 
3176	br-j05	4	29	74692	Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones . 
3177	br-j05	4	30	74705	As_is the case with the surface-active_agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high . 
3178	br-j05	4	31	74729	Large_numbers of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in_practice . 
3179	br-j05	5	32	74759	The problems of hard surface cleaning are not nearly as complex . 
3180	br-j05	5	33	74771	In hard surface cleaning , the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active . 
3181	br-j05	5	34	74787	Indeed , when the proper inorganic constituents are employed , practically any wetting or surface-active_agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard surface cleaning formulation . 
3182	br-j05	5	35	74820	Hydroxides , orthophosphates , borates , carbonates , and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard surface cleaners . 
3183	br-j05	5	36	74839	In_addition , the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else . 
3184	br-j05	5	37	74857	The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers . 
3185	br-j05	6	38	74876	Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical_chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces . 
3186	br-j05	6	39	74937	The purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below : 
3187	br-j05	7	40	74960	Dirt , which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties . 
3188	br-j05	8	41	74987	Greasy soils , which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats ( esters of glycerol with long chain organic acids ) . 
3189	br-j05	9	42	75008	Stains , which include the wide variety of nonparticulate materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object . 
3190	br-j05	10	43	75033	Miscellaneous soils , which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue . 
3191	br-j05	11	44	75051	The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent . 
3192	br-j05	11	45	75067	However , a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes_under_the_name_of van_der_Waal_'s_forces . 
3193	br-j05	11	46	75084	This is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles , or to stick_to an uncharged surface . 
3194	br-j05	11	47	75113	Obviously , if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or , if one kind is charged and the other kind is not , the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced . 
3195	br-j05	11	48	75152	Likewise , a charged particle will tend to stick_to an uncharged surface and vice_versa , and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge . 
3196	br-j05	11	49	75184	In_addition , dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface_tension of liquids , including liquid greases . 
3197	br-j05	12	50	75209	Greases , stains , and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface . 
3198	br-j05	12	51	75224	In most cases , these soils are taken_up as liquids through capillary_action . 
3199	br-j05	12	52	75237	In an essentially static system , an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial_tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active_agent . 
3200	br-j05	13	53	75266	The washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts , to some extent , as a dissolving and solvating agent . 
3201	br-j05	13	54	75313	Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; and natural waters , in_addition , often contain impurities such_as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove . 
3202	br-j05	13	55	75349	Therefore , detergents are used . 
3203	br-j05	13	56	75355	The detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils . 
3204	br-j05	13	57	75369	The other constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils . 
3205	br-j05	14	58	75394	As_is well_known , detergent actives belong_to the chemical class consisting_of moderately high molecular_weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the property of forming micelles in solution . 
3206	br-j05	14	59	75421	Physicochemical investigations of anionic surfactants , including the soaps , have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration . 
3207	br-j05	14	60	75456	( 1 ) Below the critical micelle concentration , monomers and some dimers are present . 
3208	br-j05	14	61	75472	( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 . 
3209	br-j05	14	62	75505	( 3 ) For anionics , these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups ( the ionized ends ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase . 
3210	br-j05	14	63	75544	Obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substances such_as greases , oils , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at_home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase . 
3211	br-j05	14	64	75578	Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as_much_as approximately two-fold . 
3212	br-j05	14	65	75601	Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process . 
3213	br-j05	15	66	75627	Related_to micelle formation is the technologically important ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil_water_interfaces in such a manner that the polar ( or ionized ) end of the molecule is directed towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase . 
3214	br-j05	15	67	75672	In the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant . 
3215	br-j05	15	68	75692	Then during washing , the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase . 
3216	br-j05	15	69	75730	Obviously , a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in_place_of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil . 
3217	br-j05	16	70	75760	Substances other_than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases . 
3218	br-j05	16	71	75781	This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall_into the class of polyelectrolytes . 
3219	br-j05	16	72	75800	Whereas the usual organic surface-active_agent is strongly sorbed at oil-water_interfaces , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure ( see Table 26 - 2 on p. 1678 ) . 
3220	br-j05	16	73	75841	Thus , for aqueous media , we can think_of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active_agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active_agent . 
3221	br-j05	17	74	75873	From the equilibrium sorption data which are available , it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative_charge . 
3222	br-j05	17	75	75915	The charged particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative_charge under washing conditions . 
3223	br-j05	17	76	75941	The negatively_charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go_into the aqueous phase . 
3224	br-j05	17	77	75955	This hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency . 
3225	br-j05	17	78	75971	It does not consider the kinetic effects of the phosphate builders on sorption desorption phenomena which will be discussed later ( see pp. 1746 - 1748 ) . 
3226	br-j05	18	79	75999	The crude picture of the detergency process thus_far developed can be represented as : * * f The influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic_energy on a molecular scale . 
3227	br-j05	18	80	76039	Freed soil must be dispersed and protected against flocculation . 
3228	br-j05	18	81	76049	Cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil . 
3229	br-j05	18	82	76061	It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe . 
3230	br-j05	19	83	76081	Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process , it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having `` synergistic '' properties has gained widespread acceptance . 
3231	br-j05	19	84	76120	In the over-all process , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each constituent of a built detergent formulation ; and , indeed , there is no_more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making_up a given commercial organic active . 
3232	br-j06	1	1	76187	The thermal exchange of chlorine between * * f and liquid * * f is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180 ` and above . 
3233	br-j06	1	2	76215	The photochemical_exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65 ` using light absorbed only by the * * f . 
3234	br-j06	1	3	76244	In the gas phase , with * * f of * * f and * * f of * * f , quantum yields of the order of * * f have been observed at 85 ` . 
3235	br-j06	1	4	76282	Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction . 
3236	br-j06	1	5	76302	It appears possible to set a lower_limit of about * * f for the activation_energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon_tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form * * f radical . 
3237	br-j06	1	6	76339	The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions . 
3238	br-j06	2	7	76384	Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon_tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data . 
3239	br-j06	2	8	76416	It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical_reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation_energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free_radicals , as_well_as information on the heat_of_dissociation of the carbon halogen bond . 
3240	br-j06	2	9	76468	The reaction of chlorine with carbon_tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies . 
3241	br-j06	2	10	76481	It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid . 
3242	br-j06	2	11	76507	It should be possible to free carbon_tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine . 
3243	br-j06	2	12	76533	Furthermore , the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain_reaction since the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; also it would be expected that * * f would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for * * f radicals . 
3244	br-j06	2	13	76603	Contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents . 
3245	br-j06	2	14	76632	We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon_tetrachloride . 
3246	br-j06	3	15	76673	Matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a tube of resublimed * * f into an evacuated Pyrex system where it was condensed with liquid_air . 
3247	br-j06	3	16	76700	It was then distilled at_least three times from a trap at_- 78 ` to a liquid_air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each distillation . 
3248	br-j06	3	17	76729	The purified product was stored at_- 78 ` in a tube equipped with a break_seal . 
3249	br-j06	4	18	76745	Of several methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine , the exchange of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum_chloride at room_temperature was found to be the most satisfactory . 
3250	br-j06	4	19	76773	To prepare the latter , silver_chloride was precipitated from a solution containing * * f obtained from the Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory . 
3251	br-j06	4	20	76793	The silver_chloride was fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant product of * * f which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line . 
3252	br-j06	4	21	76824	Previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take_place . 
3253	br-j06	4	22	76838	The radiochlorine was stored at_- 78 ` in a tube equipped with a break_seal . 
3254	br-j06	5	23	76853	Liter quantities of Mallinckrodt , low sulfur , reagent grade carbon_tetrachloride were saturated with * * f and * * f and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a_few inches . 
3255	br-j06	5	24	76893	The mixture was then extracted with alkali and with water following which the carbon_tetrachloride was distilled on a Vigreux column , a 25 % center cut being retained which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of * * f . 
3256	br-j06	5	25	76935	Purified inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen_out and sealed_off in a flask equipped with a break_seal . 
3257	br-j06	5	26	76962	This chlorine carbon_tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distilled off . 
3258	br-j06	5	27	76988	The required amount of carbon_tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line . 
3259	br-j06	5	28	77009	The desired amounts of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen_down and the manifold as_a_whole was sealed_off . 
3260	br-j06	5	29	77040	The contents of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking , redistributed to the reaction tubes , frozen_down , and each tube was then sealed_off . 
3261	br-j06	5	30	77070	The reactants for the gas phase experiments were first frozen_out in a side arm attached to the manifold and then allowed to distill slowly into the manifold of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing_off . 
3262	br-j06	5	31	77104	This method in_general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of reactants in each of the six cells from a set . 
3263	br-j06	6	32	77127	The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary_tubing 2.5 mm. i.d. and about 15 cm. long . 
3264	br-j06	6	33	77149	In a_few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing of 1 mm. wall thickness . 
3265	br-j06	6	34	77169	Both types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres exerted by the carbon_tetrachloride at 220 ` . 
3266	br-j06	6	35	77188	The photochemical_reaction cells consisted_of 10 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing , 5.5 cm. long , diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed_through only liquid glass interfaces and not gas glass interfaces . 
3267	br-j06	6	36	77223	These cells were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon_tetrachloride . 
3268	br-j06	6	37	77246	The round cells were reproducibly positioned in the light_beam which entered the thermostated mineral_oil bath through a window . 
3269	br-j06	6	38	77265	Two types of light source were used , a thousand watt projection lamp and an AH6 high pressure mercury arc . 
3270	br-j06	6	39	77286	The light was filtered by the soft_glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon_tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell . 
3271	br-j06	6	40	77317	Relative incident light intensities were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system . 
3272	br-j06	6	41	77329	Changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell . 
3273	br-j06	7	42	77356	Following reaction the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20 % aqueous sodium_iodide solution . 
3274	br-j06	7	43	77375	Carrier * * f was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated ( cells containing gaseous reactants were immersed in liquid_air before opening under sodium_iodide ) . 
3275	br-j06	7	44	77404	After titration of the liberated * * f with * * f , aliquots of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a solution type Geiger_tube . 
3276	br-j06	7	45	77434	In the liquid phase runs the amount of carbon_tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments after emptying . 
3277	br-j06	7	46	77462	The fraction of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts / minute observed in the carbon_tetrachloride to the counts / minute calculated for the carbon_tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon_tetrachloride , empirically determined correction being made for the difference in counting efficiency of * * f in * * f and * * f . 
3278	br-j06	8	47	77526	In studying the liquid phase thermal reaction , some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared and analyzed . 
3279	br-j06	8	48	77547	Experiments were done at 180 , 200 , 210 , 220 ` . 
3280	br-j06	8	49	77560	Following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per_cent , a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine , to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes . 
3281	br-j06	8	50	77636	In_addition to the method described in the section above , chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis of a * * f eutectic on the vacuum line , and by exchange of * * f with molten * * f . 
3282	br-j06	8	51	77678	Calcium_hydride was substituted for * * f as a drying_agent for carbon_tetrachloride . 
3283	br-j06	8	52	77691	No correlation between these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found . 
3284	br-j06	9	53	77705	The reaction rates observed at 200 ` ranged from * * f of the chlorine exchanged per hour to 0.7 exchanged per hour . 
3285	br-j06	9	54	77729	In most cases the chlorine concentration was about * * f . 
3286	br-j06	9	55	77741	Sets of reaction tubes containing 0.2 of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another , both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine exchanged per hour . 
3287	br-j06	9	56	77780	No detectable reaction was found at room_temperature for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up_to 5 hours . 
3288	br-j06	10	57	77797	The liquid phase photochemical_exchange between chlorine and carbon_tetrachloride was more reproducible than the thermal exchange , although still erratic . 
3289	br-j06	10	58	77817	The improvement was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as_a_group on the same manifold . 
3290	br-j06	10	59	77836	Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings . 
3291	br-j06	10	60	77850	Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85 ` in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation_energy and the effect of light intensity . 
3292	br-j06	10	61	77894	In all cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination . 
3293	br-j06	10	62	77911	By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation_energies ranging from 11 to 18 * * f was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases . 
3294	br-j06	11	63	77953	It was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl_oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption_spectra of uranyl_oxalate and of chlorine , and considering the spectral distribution of the light source . 
3295	br-j06	11	64	78011	These estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon_tetrachloride at 65 ` is of the order_of_magnitude of unity . 
3296	br-j06	12	65	78036	When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and phosgene were produced . 
3297	br-j06	12	66	78060	Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at * * f . 
3298	br-j06	13	67	78077	Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical_exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon_tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate . 
3299	br-j06	13	68	78145	Data on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table /1 . 
3300	br-j06	13	69	78164	. 
3301	br-j06	14	70	78165	In series /1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm. . 
3302	br-j06	14	71	78195	The last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 ( 14.7 cm. distance ) calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity . 
3303	br-j06	14	72	78256	Direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series /2 , where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen . 
3304	br-j07	1	1	78297	The Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive_force of the impinging solar_radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . 
3305	br-j07	1	2	78353	The radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size - a 1000 - | m diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . 
3306	br-j07	1	3	78385	Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar corpuscular_radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . 
3307	br-j07	1	4	78410	Further , the corpuscular_radiation , i.e. , the solar_wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive_force to the gravitational_force . 
3308	br-j07	2	5	78457	The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi major_axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor_axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . 
3309	br-j07	2	6	78489	Also , planetary gravitational_attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . 
3310	br-j07	2	7	78509	At one astronomical_unit from the sun ( the Earth 's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . 
3311	br-j07	2	8	78529	If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about * * f km of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic_energy less than their potential_energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . 
3312	br-j07	2	9	78574	De_Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more_and_more eccentric without changing the semi major_axis . 
3313	br-j07	2	10	78615	This effect can give_rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth . 
3314	br-j07	3	11	78628	Since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary_space . 
3315	br-j07	3	12	78661	There are several possible sources . 
3316	br-j07	3	13	78667	According_to Whipple ( 1955 ) , cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state . 
3317	br-j07	3	14	78692	Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material . 
3318	br-j07	3	15	78701	It is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon . 
3319	br-j07	4	16	78724	One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space . 
3320	br-j07	4	17	78738	Even in the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at_least four orders_of_magnitude . 
3321	br-j07	4	18	78766	This large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved . 
3322	br-j07	4	19	78787	Beyond a_few million kilometers from the Earth , but still in the region of the Earth 's orbit , a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable . 
3323	br-j07	4	20	78818	At greater distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain . 
3324	br-j07	5	21	78832	There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment . 
3325	br-j07	5	22	78843	Direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors . 
3326	br-j07	5	23	78857	In_addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain . 
3327	br-j07	5	24	78878	From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal_light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane . 
3328	br-j07	5	25	78920	Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component . 
3329	br-j07	5	26	78941	The cores of deep sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category . 
3330	br-j07	5	27	78960	The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth . 
3331	br-j07	6	28	78977	The direct_evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from piezoelectric sensors ( essentially microphones ) and from wire gages ; these instruments are installed on rockets , satellites , and space_probes . 
3332	br-j07	6	29	79012	Statistically , the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha ( Explorer_1 , ) , 1958 Delta_2 ( Sputnik 3 , ) , and 1959 Eta ( Vanguard 3 , ) . 
3333	br-j07	6	30	79049	These vehicles , with large sensitive areas , have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure . 
3334	br-j07	6	31	79075	Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive area exposure time products contribute some information . 
3335	br-j07	7	32	79089	The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was * * f for particles of mass greater than * * f ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of * * f . 
3336	br-j07	7	33	79136	The data show daily and diurnal_variations . 
3337	br-j07	7	34	79143	Ninety per_cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order_of_magnitude . 
3338	br-j07	7	35	79173	One may conclude that most_of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the Earth 's orbit . 
3339	br-j07	8	36	79194	There have been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta_2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable . 
3340	br-j07	8	37	79216	On May 15 , a very large increase occurred with * * f of mass between * * f and * * f ; for the next two days , the impact rate was * * f ; and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less_than * * f ( Nazarova , 1960 ) . 
3341	br-j07	8	38	79275	The data for the first day indicate a meteor_stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux . 
3342	br-j07	9	39	79303	Preliminary data from 1959_Eta give an average impact rate of * * f for masses larger than * * f for about 1000 events in a 22 - day period ( LaGow and Alexander , 1960 ) . 
3343	br-j07	9	40	79341	The day-to-day rate varied by less_than a factor of 4.5 . 
3344	br-j07	9	41	79352	The data have not_yet been analyzed for diurnal_variations . 
3345	br-j07	9	42	79361	Note that the mass threshold is four_times that of 1958_Alpha and that the flux is one_fifth as large . 
3346	br-j07	9	43	79380	If one assumes that the average flux did not change between measurements , a mass distribution curve is obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius to the inverse 7 2 power of the radius . 
3347	br-j07	10	44	79420	Space_probes have yielded little information . 
3348	br-j07	10	45	79426	Pioneer_1 , recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours . 
3349	br-j07	10	46	79448	With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a_few counts , the second and third Russian space_probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less_than that of larger ones . 
3350	br-j07	10	47	79483	Being based on so few events , these results are of dubious validity . 
3351	br-j07	11	48	79497	The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in_terms_of the particle parameters is very uncertain . 
3352	br-j07	11	49	79510	Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities . 
3353	br-j07	11	50	79538	However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship . 
3354	br-j07	11	51	79561	In the United_States , most_of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces . 
3355	br-j07	11	52	79579	The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor . 
3356	br-j07	11	53	79612	This `` ejection '' momentum is linearly related to the particle energy . 
3357	br-j07	11	54	79625	They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater . 
3358	br-j07	11	55	79648	There is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in_that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin . 
3359	br-j07	11	56	79678	The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of * * f in the U.S. work and * * f in the U.S.S.R. work . 
3360	br-j07	11	57	79712	The threshold mass of about * * f corresponds to a 10 - | m diameter sphere of density * * f . 
3361	br-j07	11	58	79735	However , the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as * * f . 
3362	br-j07	11	59	79769	To_what_extent such low_density applies to micrometeorites is unknown . 
3363	br-j07	11	60	79778	The velocity value used is also open_to some question ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the Earth , only about one_third the above_mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass . 
3364	br-j07	11	61	79816	Zodiacal_light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors . 
3365	br-j07	11	62	79859	The diurnal_variation in the observed flux may be partly due_to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity . 
3366	br-j07	12	63	79880	The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data . 
3367	br-j07	12	64	79902	A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5 - 1 . 
3368	br-j07	12	65	79934	From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude . 
3369	br-j07	12	66	79971	The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density * * f except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar_system in the presence of solar_radiation pressure . 
3370	br-j07	12	67	80011	The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors . 
3371	br-j07	12	68	80038	It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant . 
3372	br-j07	12	69	80073	The values agree with the data from 1958_Alpha and 1959_Eta . 
3373	br-j07	12	70	80084	The figures in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50 per_cent shielding by the Earth ; hence , these figures apply immediately above the Earth 's atmosphere . 
3374	br-j07	12	71	80115	The unshielded flux is given in the last column ; these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary_space near the Earth . 
3375	br-j07	12	72	80140	Of_course , if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the fluxes in interplanetary_space should be less_than the figures given here . 
3376	br-j07	13	73	80164	Note that the mass scale is one to two orders_of_magnitude greater than some previously used ; for_example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a * * f , zero magnitude meteorite . 
3377	br-j07	13	74	80202	The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic_energy into light . 
3378	br-j07	13	75	80219	The mass scale used in Table 5 - 1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related_to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 ) . 
3379	br-j07	14	76	80271	A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) . 
3380	br-j07	14	77	80293	Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites . 
3381	br-j07	14	78	80307	The approximate equation is * * f , where n is the number of * * f with electron line density greater than or equal to * * f , and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite . 
3382	br-j07	14	79	80348	Therefore , n is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse 7 2 power derived from 1958_Alpha and 1959_Eta data . 
3383	br-j07	14	80	80375	At the fifteenth magnitude , * * f , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , * * f . 
3384	br-j07	14	81	80394	These extrapolated fluxes are about an order_of_magnitude less_than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple 's table . 
3385	br-j07	14	82	80416	The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons . 
3386	br-j07	14	83	80426	The observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region . 
3387	br-j07	14	84	80449	The solar electromagnetic - and corpuscular-radiation_pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a_few microns . 
3388	br-j07	14	85	80481	Also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( Best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected . 
3389	br-j07	15	86	80524	A measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of deep sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions ( Pettersson , 1960 ) . 
3390	br-j07	15	87	80557	Most meteoritic material , by the time it reaches the Earth's_surface , has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere . 
3391	br-j07	15	88	80587	For all meteorites , the average nickel content is about 2.5 per_cent . 
3392	br-j07	15	89	80600	This is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx . 
3393	br-j07	15	90	80626	Present data indicate an accretion of about * * f tons per_year over the entire globe , or about * * f . 
3394	br-j08	1	1	80649	Biological_warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man . 
3395	br-j08	1	2	80674	It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious_disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons_systems . 
3396	br-j08	1	3	80699	Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic_animals . 
3397	br-j08	2	4	80714	Biological_warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon . 
3398	br-j08	2	5	80724	The major reason for this is that it has no quick kill effect . 
3399	br-j08	2	6	80738	The incubation_period of infectious_disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter . 
3400	br-j08	2	7	80763	A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation_period of most infectious_diseases . 
3401	br-j08	2	8	80778	Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such_as large cities . 
3402	br-j08	3	9	80797	An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an aerosol or cloud of agent over the target_area . 
3403	br-j08	3	10	80820	This concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of particulate biological materials , the pathogenesis of respiratory infections , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence . 
3404	br-j08	4	11	80853	The biological and physical_properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years . 
3405	br-j08	4	12	80870	Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics . 
3406	br-j08	4	13	80900	Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assessment techniques . 
3407	br-j08	4	14	80913	Much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures . 
3408	br-j08	4	15	80929	The intra nasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms . 
3409	br-j08	5	16	80958	The importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated . 
3410	br-j08	5	17	80971	The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory_tract , such_as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi , are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence . 
3411	br-j08	5	18	81018	Very small particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar_bed of the lungs . 
3412	br-j08	5	19	81050	This area is highly susceptible to infection . 
3413	br-j08	5	20	81058	The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intra tissue inoculation . 
3414	br-j08	5	21	81076	The relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1 . 
3415	br-j08	6	22	81090	In considering BW defense , it must be recognized that a number of critical meteorological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect . 
3416	br-j08	6	23	81117	For_example , bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air . 
3417	br-j08	6	24	81131	There are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne . 
3418	br-j08	6	25	81142	Neutral or inversion meteorological_conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel_along the surface . 
3419	br-j08	6	26	81156	It will rise during lapse conditions . 
3420	br-j08	6	27	81163	There are , of_course , certain times during the 24 - hour daily cycle when most_of these conditions will be met . 
3421	br-j08	7	28	81185	Certain other properties of small particles , in_addition_to those already mentioned in_connection_with penetration of the respiratory_tract , are noteworthy in defense considerations . 
3422	br-j08	7	29	81208	The smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settling out . 
3423	br-j08	7	30	81222	An aerosol of such small particles . 
3424	br-j08	7	31	81229	moreover , diffuses through structures in much the same manner as a gas . 
3425	br-j08	7	32	81243	There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such_as widespread contamination of kitchens , restaurants , food stores , hospitals , etc. . 
3426	br-j08	7	33	81271	Depending_on the organism , there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products , i.e. , in milk for_example . 
3427	br-j08	7	34	81292	The secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense . 
3428	br-j08	8	35	81312	Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field_trials : 
3429	br-j08	9	36	81329	In the first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological_conditions . 
3430	br-j08	9	37	81352	Zinc_cadmium_sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were disseminated . 
3431	br-j08	9	38	81363	This material fluoresces under ultraviolet_light which facilitates its sampling and assessment . 
3432	br-j08	9	39	81375	Four_hundred and fifty pounds was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156 miles . 
3433	br-j08	10	40	81392	Figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial . 
3434	br-j08	10	41	81402	The particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles . 
3435	br-j08	10	42	81414	From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34000 square_miles was covered . 
3436	br-j08	10	43	81432	These dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case . 
3437	br-j08	11	44	81450	The behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field_trial conducted with a non pathogenic organism . 
3438	br-j08	11	45	81476	An aqueous suspension of the spores of B. subtilis , var. niger , generally known as Bacillus_globigii , was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles . 
3439	br-j08	11	46	81501	A satisfactory cloud was produced even_though these nozzles were only about 5 per_cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns . 
3440	br-j08	11	47	81530	In this test , 130 gallons of a suspension , having a count of * * f organisms per ml , or a total of approximately * * f spores , was aerosolized . 
3441	br-j08	11	48	81564	The spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel , cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-shore breeze . 
3442	br-j08	11	49	81590	Spraying continued along a two mile course . 
3443	br-j08	12	50	81598	This operation was started at 5 : 00 p.m. and lasted for 29 minutes . 
3444	br-j08	12	51	81613	There was a slight lapse condition , a moderate fog , and 100 per_cent relative_humidity . 
3445	br-j08	12	52	81629	A network of sampling_stations had been set_up on shore . 
3446	br-j08	12	53	81639	These were located at the homes of Government employees , in Government_Offices , buildings and reservations within the trial area . 
3447	br-j08	12	54	81660	A rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floors of a Government_office building . 
3448	br-j08	13	55	81694	All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours . 
3449	br-j08	13	56	81714	In this instance , there was a dosage of 562 during the first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four hour period , a four-fold increase . 
3450	br-j08	13	57	81745	This suggests that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased . 
3451	br-j08	14	58	81764	As can be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol . 
3452	br-j08	14	59	81781	The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source . 
3453	br-j08	14	60	81792	As can be seen from these dosage isopleths , approximately 100 square_miles was covered within the area sampled . 
3454	br-j08	14	61	81811	It is quite likely that an even greater area was covered , particularly downwind . 
3455	br-j08	15	62	81826	The dosages in the three levels of the vertical profile were : * * f This was not , of_course , enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol . 
3456	br-j08	16	63	81862	A number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather_than by the natural portal of entry . 
3457	br-j08	16	64	81891	Some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural portal . 
3458	br-j08	16	65	81920	Botulinal toxin , for_example , is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os . 
3459	br-j08	16	66	81939	In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , making diagnosis difficult . 
3460	br-j08	16	67	81959	In tularemia produced by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit_fever '' on a finger . 
3461	br-j08	17	68	81983	An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious . 
3462	br-j08	17	69	81998	Agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such_as those causing Q_fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category . 
3463	br-j08	18	70	82029	An agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements . 
3464	br-j08	18	71	82050	It is , obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property . 
3465	br-j08	18	72	82066	In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction . 
3466	br-j08	18	73	82080	Moreover , it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable . 
3467	br-j08	19	74	82103	An aggressor would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population . 
3468	br-j08	19	75	82126	A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized . 
3469	br-j08	19	76	82144	It must be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent . 
3470	br-j08	20	77	82179	There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made . 
3471	br-j08	20	78	82198	An enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism , a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality . 
3472	br-j08	21	79	82220	It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such_as antibiotic resistant strains . 
3473	br-j08	21	80	82235	Mutants may also be developed with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in identification . 
3474	br-j08	21	81	82252	All_of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management . 
3475	br-j08	22	82	82266	Biological agents are , of_course , highly host specific . 
3476	br-j08	22	83	82276	They do not destroy physical_structures as is true of high_explosives . 
3477	br-j08	22	84	82287	This may be of overriding importance in considering military objectives . 
3478	br-j08	23	85	82298	The question of epidemic disease merits some discussion . 
3479	br-j08	23	86	82307	Only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem . 
3480	br-j08	23	87	82318	Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics . 
3481	br-j08	23	88	82341	They then point_out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of epidemics , it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated . 
3482	br-j08	23	89	82375	They argue further ( and somewhat contradictorily ) that our knowledge and resources in preventive_medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease . 
3483	br-j08	23	90	82402	this is why this approach to BW defense has not been given major attention . 
3484	br-j08	24	91	82417	Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target . 
3485	br-j08	24	92	82434	This , of_course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease . 
3486	br-j08	24	93	82455	A hypothetical example will illustrate this point . 
3487	br-j08	24	94	82463	Let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus ( Rickettsia_prowazwki ) over City A and that a large_number of cases of typhus_fever resulted therefrom . 
3488	br-j08	24	95	82502	No epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy . 
3489	br-j08	24	96	82520	Lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus . 
3490	br-j08	24	97	82528	In this case , then , the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack . 
3491	br-j08	24	98	82553	This was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic . 
3492	br-j08	24	99	82566	On_the_other_hand , a similar attack might have been made on City_B whose population was known to be lousy . 
3493	br-j08	24	100	82585	One might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack . 
3494	br-j08	25	101	82604	The major defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from appropriate disseminating devices . 
3495	br-j08	25	102	82625	It should be no_more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons . 
3496	br-j08	25	103	82638	The same delivery vehicles - whether they be airplanes , submarines or guided_missiles - should be usable . 
3497	br-j08	25	104	82656	If it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic_bomb on a city , it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city . 
3498	br-j08	26	105	82687	Biological agents are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense . 
3499	br-j08	26	106	82706	A_few obvious target_areas of great importance might be mentioned . 
3500	br-j08	26	107	82716	The air_conditioning and ventilating_systems of large buildings are subject_to attack . 
3501	br-j08	26	108	82727	America is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed , precooked and even predigested foods . 
3502	br-j08	26	109	82743	This is an enormous industry that is subject_to sabotage . 
3503	br-j08	26	110	82753	One must include the preparation of soft_drinks and the processing of milk and milk products . 
3504	br-j08	26	111	82769	Huge industries are involved also in the production of biological products , drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack . 
3505	br-j09	1	1	82793	A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood_group antibodies . 
3506	br-j09	1	2	82809	These include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column_chromatography on ion_exchange celluloses . 
3507	br-j09	1	3	82827	Modifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators . 
3508	br-j09	1	4	82841	Abelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh_antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE_cellulose and carboxymethyl_cellulose . 
3509	br-j09	1	5	82864	Speer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood_group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from DEAE-cellulose . 
3510	br-j09	1	6	82889	Fahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti - A and anti - B agglutinins from preisolated | g-globulin samples . 
3511	br-j09	2	7	82919	In the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson , and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described . 
3512	br-j09	3	8	82965	Serum samples were obtained from normal group A , group B and group O donors . 
3513	br-j09	3	9	82981	Three of the anti - Rh sera used were taken from recently sensitized individuals . 
3514	br-j09	3	10	82996	One contained complete antibody and had a titer of 1 : 512 in saline . 
3515	br-j09	3	11	83011	The second contained incomplete antibody and showed titers of 1 : 256 in albumin and 1 : 2048 by the indirect_Coombs_test . 
3516	br-j09	3	12	83033	The third , containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies , had titers of 1 : 256 in saline , 1 : 512 in albumin and 1 : 1024 by the indirect_Coombs_test . 
3517	br-j09	3	13	83068	In_addition one serum was obtained from a donor ( R._E. . ) who had been sensitized 6 years previously . 
3518	br-j09	3	14	83088	This serum exhibited titers of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : 256 by the indirect_Coombs_test . 
3519	br-j09	3	15	83106	These antibody titers were determined by reaction with homozygous * * f red_cells . 
3520	br-j09	4	16	83120	Anti - A and anti - B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods . 
3521	br-j09	4	17	83152	One drop of each sample was added to one drop of a 2 % suspension of group * * f or group B red_cells in a small * * f test_tube . 
3522	br-j09	4	18	83184	In several instances group O cells were also used as controls . 
3523	br-j09	4	19	83196	The red_cells were used within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use . 
3524	br-j09	4	20	83216	The mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room_temperature for 1 hr . 
3525	br-j09	4	21	83233	the tubes were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined macroscopically for agglutination . 
3526	br-j09	4	22	83250	For the albumin method , equal volumes of 30 % bovine albumin , sample and 2 % cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room_temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min . 
3527	br-j09	4	23	83291	All samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods . 
3528	br-j09	4	24	83303	The activities of fractions of sera containing Rh_antibodies were tested by the saline , albumin and indirect_Coombs techniques . 
3529	br-j09	4	25	83322	Homozygous and heterozygous * * f cells , * * f and homozygous and heterozygous * * f cells were used to test each sample ; however , in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous * * f and homozygous * * f cells will be presented here . 
3530	br-j09	5	26	83377	The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ABO samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37 ` C before centrifugation . 
3531	br-j09	5	27	83406	The saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect_Coombs_test in the following manner . 
3532	br-j09	5	28	83421	The cells were washed three times with saline , anti human serum was added , the cells were resuspended , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined for agglutination . 
3533	br-j09	5	29	83457	The anti human sera used were prepared by injecting whole human serum into rabbits . 
3534	br-j09	5	30	83472	Those antisera shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were selected for used in the present study . 
3535	br-j09	6	31	83495	The red_cells for the Rh_antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the * * f cells , which had been glycerolized and stored at - 20 ` C for approximately 1 year . 
3536	br-j09	6	32	83532	These cells were thawed at 37 ` C for 30 min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2 % ) . 
3537	br-j09	6	33	83572	The cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to 2 % in saline . 
3538	br-j09	7	34	83589	Blood samples were allowed to clot at room_temperature for 3 hr , centrifuged and the serum was removed . 
3539	br-j09	7	35	83608	The serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently dialyzed in the cold for at_least 24 hr against three to four changes , approximately 750 ml each , of `` starting_buffer '' . 
3540	br-j09	7	36	83639	This buffer , pH 8.6 , was 0.005 M in * * f and 0.039 M in tris ( hydroxymethyl ) - aminomethane ( Tris ) . 
3541	br-j09	7	37	83666	After dialysis the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a * * f cm column of DEAE-cellulose equilibrated with starting_buffer . 
3542	br-j09	7	38	83689	The DEAE-cellulose , containing 0.78 mEq of N / g , was prepared in our laboratory by the method of Peterson and Sober ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose , 100 - 230 mesh . 
3543	br-j09	7	39	83724	The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting_buffer , centrifuged , resuspended in 2.5 ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity . 
3544	br-j09	8	40	83758	The chromatography was done at 6 ` C using gradient elution , essentially according_to Sober and Peterson . 
3545	br-j09	8	41	83776	The deep concave gradient employed ( fig. 2 ) was obtained with a nine chambered gradient elution device ( `` Varigrad '' , reference ( 8 ) ) and has been described elsewhere . 
3546	br-j09	8	42	83810	the other , a shallow concave gradient ( Fig. 1 ) , was produced with a so-called `` cone sphere '' apparatus , the `` cone '' being a 2 - liter Erlenmeyer_flask and the `` sphere , '' a 2 - liter round-bottom flask . 
3547	br-j09	8	43	83856	Each initially contained 1700 ml of buffer ; in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer , 0.50 M in both * * f and Tris , pH 4.1 . 
3548	br-j09	9	44	83891	A flow_rate of 72 * * f was used and 12 ml fractions were collected . 
3549	br-j09	9	45	83907	Approximately 165 fractions were obtained from each column . 
3550	br-j09	9	46	83916	These were read at 280 m | m in a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer and tested for antibody activity as described above . 
3551	br-j09	10	47	83939	For protein identification , fractions from the column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5 ` C or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline . 
3552	br-j09	10	48	83981	During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2 ` C by surrounding the apparatus with ice . 
3553	br-j09	10	49	84000	Because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments . 
3554	br-j09	11	50	84035	Paper_electrophoresis was carried_out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco model R cell using barbital buffer , pH 8.6 , ionic strength 0.075 , at room_temperature on Whatman 3 MM filter_paper . 
3555	br-j09	11	51	84067	Five milliamperes / cell were applied for 18 hr , after which the strips were stained with bromophenol_blue and densitometry was carried_out using a Spinco_Analytrol . 
3556	br-j09	12	52	84093	When paper_electrophoresis was to be used for preparation , eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run / chamber under the conditions described above . 
3557	br-j09	12	53	84128	At the end of the run , the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried , stained for 1 hr , washed and dried , while the other strips were maintained in a horizontal position at 1 ` C . 
3558	br-j09	12	54	84173	The unstained strips were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide , and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands . 
3559	br-j09	12	55	84200	The strip sections containing a given protein were pooled , eluted with 0.5 ml of isotonic saline , and the eluates were tested for antibody activity . 
3560	br-j09	13	56	84227	Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at_least 500 volumes of phosphate buffered saline , pH 7.2 , ionic strength 0.154 . 
3561	br-j09	13	57	84269	They were then centrifuged at 59780 rpm for 35 to 80 min at 20 ` C in a Spinco model E ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25 % . 
3562	br-j09	13	58	84301	Sedimentation coefficients were computed as * * f values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the Schlieren patterns . 
3563	br-j09	14	59	84324	For preparative ultracentrifugation , fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less , transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline . 
3564	br-j09	14	60	84359	Ultracentrifugation was then carried_out in a Spinco model L ultracentrifuge at 40000 rpm for 125 to 150 min , refrigeration being used throughout the run . 
3565	br-j09	14	61	84385	Successive 1 - ml fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic_syringe , starting at the top of the tube , and tested for agglutinin activity . 
3566	br-j09	15	62	84412	Other methods will be described below . 
3567	br-j09	16	63	84419	The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting_buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood_group of the donor . 
3568	br-j09	16	64	84442	With either of the gradients described , chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated agglutinins of the ABO series into at_least three regions ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) : 
3569	br-j09	16	65	84469	one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity . 
3570	br-j09	16	66	84491	These have been labeled Regions 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig. 1 . 
3571	br-j09	16	67	84509	When the early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` cone sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P._J. and R._S. , Fig. 1 and E._M. , Fig. 2 ) . 
3572	br-j09	16	68	84568	The latter procedure gave_rise to a small active protein peak ( Region 1a ) between Regions 1 and 2 . 
3573	br-j09	16	69	84588	In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( Region 3 , Fig. 1 ) . 
3574	br-j09	16	70	84616	Moreover , after concentration using negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated 2a ( donors P._J. , D._A. , and J._F. , Fig. 1 ) . 
3575	br-j09	17	71	84649	Not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating_activity , as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas . 
3576	br-j09	17	72	84669	In all cases , most of the activity lay_in the region of high anionic binding capacity . 
3577	br-j09	17	73	84686	This was particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera , in which cases activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at_all . 
3578	br-j09	17	74	84722	There appeared to be no difference in the distribution of anti - A and anti - B activity in group O serum , though in two group O donors ( J._F. and E._M. ) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) . 
3579	br-j09	18	75	84778	Several samples of citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by Method 6 of Cohn et_al . 
3580	br-j09	18	76	84795	These fractions were tested for ABO agglutinin activity , using fractions from group AB plasma as a control . 
3581	br-j09	18	77	84814	As_expected , most of the activity was found in Fraction * * f , with slight activity seen in Fraction 4 , - 1 . 
3582	br-j09	18	78	84839	A sample of Fraction * * f from group O plasma was dissolved in starting_buffer , dialyzed against this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 . 
3583	br-j09	18	79	84871	Once_again , both anti - A and anti - B activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis . 
3584	br-j09	18	80	84892	Similarly , both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the chromatographic eluate , having extremely low , low , and high anionic binding capacity , respectively ( Fig. 3 ) . 
3585	br-j09	19	81	84926	Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh_antibody activity were generally continuous and wide . 
3586	br-j09	19	82	84943	The incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the chromatogram ; the complete , in the latter part . 
3587	br-j09	19	83	84964	The serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions ( Fig. 1 ) . 
3588	br-j09	19	84	84985	In all cases the activity against * * f cells was spread over a wider area than that with * * f cells , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect_Coombs ) used for comparison . 
3589	br-j09	19	85	85026	The insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting_buffer always showed strong activity . 
3590	br-j09	19	86	85039	In_fact agglutination of * * f cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing `` only '' incomplete antibody activity . 
3591	br-j09	19	87	85065	This was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal_to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detected . 
3592	br-j10	1	1	85113	Apart from the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor . 
3593	br-j10	1	2	85130	Occasionally , you may come_across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning_over sods in your garden , but you have_to be a really keen observer to see them at_all . 
3594	br-j10	1	3	85166	They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in_spite_of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt . 
3595	br-j10	1	4	85195	I must add at_once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn . 
3596	br-j10	1	5	85222	It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold_weather . 
3597	br-j10	1	6	85259	Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease . 
3598	br-j10	1	7	85279	The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50 ` F and there is not too_much wind . 
3599	br-j10	1	8	85309	Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a_couple_of those wonderful flowering currants such_as the red Ribes_sanguineum of our Pacific_Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy_willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins . 
3600	br-j10	1	9	85356	The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large_numbers of our early insects will assemble : honeybees , bumblebees , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of flies . 
3601	br-j10	1	10	85394	It is a happy , buzzing crowd . 
3602	br-j10	2	11	85402	Each male willow catkin is composed of a large_number of small flowers . 
3603	br-j10	2	12	85415	It is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs , and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green , black tipped little scale . 
3604	br-j10	2	13	85454	By scrutinizing the flowers , one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts . 
3605	br-j10	2	14	85473	Those are the nectaries or honey glands ( Fig. 26 , page 74 ) . 
3606	br-j10	2	15	85488	The staminate willow catkins , then , provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen ; a marvelous arrangement , for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread , a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed . 
3607	br-j10	2	16	85538	The only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites . 
3608	br-j10	2	17	85551	I will deal with these later_on . 
3609	br-j10	3	18	85558	Quite often , honeybees form a majority on the willow catkins . 
3610	br-j10	3	19	85570	As we have already seen in the first chapter , bumblebees are bigger , hairier , and much more colorful than honeybees , exhibiting various combinations of black , yellow , white and orange . 
3611	br-j10	3	20	85605	Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them Bombus ; there must be several dozen species in the United_States alone . 
3612	br-j10	3	21	85639	If you really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the North_American species is Bumblebees and Their Ways by O._E._Plath . 
3613	br-j10	4	22	85663	If we manage to keep track of a Bombus queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed_up for herself when she woke_up from her winter sleep . 
3614	br-j10	4	23	85702	As befits a queen , a bumblebee female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable nesting_place . 
3615	br-j10	4	24	85724	Most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such_as a deserted mouse_nest , a bird_house , or the hole made by a woodpecker ; some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss . 
3616	br-j10	4	25	85760	Once she has made_up_her_mind , the queen starts_out by constructing , in her chosen abode , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some woolly material . 
3617	br-j10	4	26	85789	On this , she builds an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous pollen and nectar mixture called beebread . 
3618	br-j10	4	27	85817	She also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills with honey . 
3619	br-j10	4	28	85831	Then , a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed . 
3620	br-j10	4	29	85853	The queen afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen , taking a sip from_time_to_time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots . 
3621	br-j10	4	30	85881	When the larvae hatch , they feed_on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother . 
3622	br-j10	4	31	85902	She continues to add to the pollen supply as_needed . 
3623	br-j10	5	32	85912	The larvae , kept warm by the queen , are full_grown in about ten days . 
3624	br-j10	5	33	85928	Each now makes a tough , papery cocoon and pupates . 
3625	br-j10	5	34	85939	After another two_weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker_bees , collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen retires to a life of egg_laying . 
3626	br-j10	5	35	85986	The first worker_bees do not mate or lay eggs ; males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season . 
3627	br-j10	5	36	86009	The broods of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed . 
3628	br-j10	5	37	86032	By the middle of the summer , many_of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queens begin to appear . 
3629	br-j10	5	38	86066	Simultaneously , males or drones are produced , mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers , although a few may be produced by the queen . 
3630	br-j10	5	39	86092	The young queens and drones leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter . 
3631	br-j10	5	40	86124	It is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in_full_swing , for_instance , in August . 
3632	br-j10	5	41	86148	The temperature then is still very high . 
3633	br-j10	5	42	86156	At the old nest , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized eggs that will produce females . 
3634	br-j10	5	43	86179	As a result , the proportion of males ( which leave the nest ) increases , and eventually the old colony will die_out completely . 
3635	br-j10	5	44	86204	The nest itself , the structure that in some cases housed about 2000 individuals when the season was at its peak , is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths . 
3636	br-j10	6	45	86240	Not always , though , does the development of a bumblebee colony take_place in the smooth fashion we have just described . 
3637	br-j10	6	46	86262	Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives . 
3638	br-j10	6	47	86284	Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo_bumblebee '' as it is called in some European_countries . 
3639	br-j10	6	48	86307	Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize . 
3640	br-j10	6	49	86324	The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind_legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen baskets - naturally ! 
3641	br-j10	6	50	86356	The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host . 
3642	br-j10	6	51	86373	When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip_in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment . 
3643	br-j10	6	52	86402	The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally . 
3644	br-j10	6	53	86422	Thus , the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread . 
3645	br-j10	6	54	86444	Later_on , they and the mother Psithyrus are fed by the Bombus workers . 
3646	br-j10	6	55	86458	Worse still , in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus female kills_off the Bombus queen . 
3647	br-j10	7	56	86479	But let us return , after this gruesome interlude , to our willow catkins in the spring ; there are other wild bees that command our attention . 
3648	br-j10	8	57	86507	It is almost certain that some of these , usually a_trifle smaller than the honeybees , are andrenas or mining_bees . 
3649	br-j10	8	58	86528	There are about 200 different kinds of Andrena in Europe alone . 
3650	br-j10	8	59	86540	One of my favorites is A._armata , a species very common in England , where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee . 
3651	br-j10	8	60	86565	The females like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns , where their little mounds of earth often appear by the hundreds . 
3652	br-j10	8	61	86590	Almost equal in size to a honeybee . 
3653	br-j10	8	62	86598	A._armata is much more beautiful in color , at_least in the female of the species : a rich , velvety , rusty red . 
3654	br-j10	8	63	86622	The males are much duller . 
3655	br-j10	9	64	86628	After having mated , an Andrena female digs a hole straight down into the ground , forming a burrow about the size of a lead_pencil . 
3656	br-j10	9	65	86654	The bottom part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or `` cells '' , each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread . 
3657	br-j10	9	66	86685	The development of the Andrena larvae is very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults . 
3658	br-j10	9	67	86710	But they are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter . 
3659	br-j10	9	68	86731	Their appearance , next spring , coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants . 
3660	br-j10	9	69	86751	In the Sacramento valley in California , for_instance , it has been observed that there was not one day 's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins . 
3661	br-j10	9	70	86786	This must be_due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal . 
3662	br-j10	10	71	86805	After the male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle is repeated . 
3663	br-j10	10	72	86819	Although Andrena is gregarious , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together , we must still call it a solitary bee . 
3664	br-j10	10	73	86845	Its life_history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life_cycle of many other species . 
3665	br-j10	10	74	86871	After_all , social life in the group of the bees is by_no_means general , although it certainly is a striking feature . 
3666	br-j10	10	75	86893	On the basis of its life_history , we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees . 
3667	br-j10	10	76	86913	The way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect , either . 
3668	br-j10	10	77	86928	It lacks pollen baskets and possesses only a large_number of long , branched hairs on its legs , on which the pollen grains will collect . 
3669	br-j10	10	78	86954	Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks_like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind . 
3670	br-j10	11	79	86985	Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali_bees . 
3671	br-j10	11	80	86996	Nomia_melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United_States west of the Great_Plains , for_example , in Utah and central Washington . 
3672	br-j10	11	81	87022	In the United_States Department_of_Agriculture 's Yearbook_of_Agriculture , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , George_E._Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200000 nesting females . 
3673	br-j10	11	82	87053	Often the burrows are only an inch or two apart , and the bee cities cover several acres . 
3674	br-j10	11	83	87072	The life_history of the alkali_bee is similar to that of Andrena , but the first activity of the adults does not take_place until summer , and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage . 
3675	br-j10	11	84	87106	In most places , there are two generations a year , a second brood of adults appearing late in the summer . 
3676	br-j10	12	85	87128	I must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias . 
3677	br-j10	12	86	87139	This may just be pride in my adopted State_of_Washington , but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near Yakima and Prosser in July or August , when the bees are in their most active period . 
3678	br-j10	12	87	87177	The name `` alkali_bee '' indicates that one has_to look_for them in rather inhospitable places . 
3679	br-j10	12	88	87193	Sometimes , although by_no_means always , these are indeed alkaline . 
3680	br-j10	12	89	87204	The thing is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist ; yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either . 
3681	br-j10	12	90	87230	They dislike dense vegetation . 
3682	br-j10	12	91	87235	Where does one find such conditions ? 
3683	br-j10	12	92	87242	The best chance , of_course , is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry , so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant growth . 
3684	br-j11	1	1	87284	Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more_than half their final length . 
3685	br-j11	1	2	87302	Laurence_M_._Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles_C_._Carpenter 's data on Michigan garter and ribbon_snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more_than half as long as the biggest adults . 
3686	br-j11	1	3	87345	Felix_Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length '' , but goes_on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three_times that at maturity . 
3687	br-j11	1	4	87385	It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect . 
3688	br-j11	1	5	87423	Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is_due to captive conditions . 
3689	br-j11	1	6	87451	Additional records of slow growth have been omitted . 
3690	br-j11	2	7	87460	It is possible to make a_few generalizations about the six giants themselves . 
3691	br-j11	2	8	87473	There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa_constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) . 
3692	br-j11	2	9	87503	Data on the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length . 
3693	br-j11	2	10	87552	For four of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine_python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa_constrictor being the smallest and the Indian_python the next in size at the former stage . 
3694	br-j11	3	11	87601	Let us speculate a_little on the maximum size of the anaconda . 
3695	br-j11	3	12	87613	If , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet . 
3696	br-j11	4	13	87675	When it comes_to rate of early growth , the Indian_python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per_year for the first two years , more_or_less . 
3697	br-j11	4	14	87704	The African rock_python , a close second , is followed in_turn by the reticulate python . 
3698	br-j11	4	15	87720	There are few data on the boa_constrictor , those for the anaconda are unconvincing , and there is nothing at_all on the amethystine_python . 
3699	br-j11	4	16	87744	It seems likely that the Indian_python comes_out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently ; it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep . 
3700	br-j11	5	17	87783	I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; at_best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather_than feet . 
3701	br-j11	5	18	87810	Until better records have been kept over longer periods_of_time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions , it will be wise to refrain_from drawing conclusions . 
3702	br-j11	6	19	87838	It is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity , but this apparently is an overestimation . 
3703	br-j11	6	20	87860	The best way to determine the correct figure ( in captives ) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth , a method that produced surprising results : maturing of a male Indian_python in less_than two years , his mate in less_than three ; data on the boa_constrictor about match this . 
3704	br-j11	7	21	87913	Another approach is to estimate from the rate_of_growth and the smallest size at maturity . 
3705	br-j11	7	22	87928	Results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations : 
3706	br-j11	7	23	87938	about three years are required , there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required . 
3707	br-j11	7	24	87959	Only the amethystine_python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity of data . 
3708	br-j11	8	25	87975	The following information on snakes varying greatly in size ( but all with less_than a 10 - foot maximum ) shows , when considered with the foregoing , that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature . 
3709	br-j11	8	26	88024	Oliver , in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United_States , could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in_addition_to the rattlers , which I shall consider separately . 
3710	br-j11	8	27	88060	These three were much alike : lined_snake ( Tropidoclonion ) , one year and nine months ; red-bellied_snake ( Storeria ) , two years ; cottonmouth ( Ancistrodon ) , two years . 
3711	br-j11	8	28	88093	Klauber investigated the rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized what others have found . 
3712	br-j11	8	29	88107	He concluded that in the southern species , which are rapidly growing types , females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three . 
3713	br-j11	8	30	88141	Other herpetologists have ascertained that in the northern United_States the prairie_rattlesnake may_not give first birth until it is four or even five years old , and that the young may be_born every_other year , rather_than annually . 
3714	br-j11	8	31	88178	Carpenter 's study showed that female common garter and ribbon_snakes of Michigan mature at about the age of two . 
3715	br-j11	9	32	88198	Oversized monsters are never brought home either alive or preserved , and field measurements are obviously open_to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimensions . 
3716	br-j11	9	33	88225	Measurements of skins are of little value ; every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer . 
3717	br-j11	10	34	88253	In_spite of all the pitfalls , there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants . 
3718	br-j11	10	35	88272	The anaconda proves to be the fly_in_the_ointment , but the reason for this is not clear ; the relatively wild conditions still found in tropical South_America might be responsible . 
3719	br-j11	11	36	88302	There are three levels on which to treat the subject . 
3720	br-j11	11	37	88313	The first is the strictly scientific , which demands concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in_the_flesh . 
3721	br-j11	11	38	88338	This approach rejects virtually all field measurements . 
3722	br-j11	11	39	88346	The next level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion ; field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected , and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated . 
3723	br-j11	11	40	88384	The third level leans_on a belief that a_lot of smoke means some fire . 
3724	br-j11	11	41	88398	The argument against this last approach is comparable_to that which rejects stories about hoop_snakes , about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again , or even of ghosts that chase people out of graveyards ; the mere piling_up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of hoop_snakes , joint_snakes , or ghosts . 
3725	br-j11	12	42	88461	Oliver has recently used the second level approach with the largest snakes , and has come to these conclusions : 
3726	br-j11	12	43	88481	the anaconda reaches a length of at_least 37 feet , the reticulate python 33 , the African rock_python 25 , the amethystine_python at_least 22 , the Indian_python 20 , and the boa_constrictor 18 - 1_2 . 
3727	br-j11	13	44	88517	Bernard_Heuvelmans also treats of the largest snakes , but on the third level , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda . 
3728	br-j11	13	45	88539	He reasons that as anacondas 30 feet long are often found , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous freaks '' over 50 . 
3729	br-j11	13	46	88565	He rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more . 
3730	br-j11	13	47	88574	His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength , but these seem to be given to complete his picture , not to be believed . 
3731	br-j11	14	48	88604	Detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows . 
3732	br-j11	15	49	88620	Discussions of the giants one_by_one will include , as_far_as_possible , data on these aspects of growth : 
3733	br-j11	15	50	88637	size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; time required to reach maturity ; rate_of_growth both before and after this crucial stage ; and maximum length , with confirmation or amplification of Oliver 's figures . 
3734	br-j11	15	51	88679	Definite information on the growth of senile individuals is lacking . 
3735	br-j11	16	52	88690	At_birth , this species varies considerably in size . 
3736	br-j11	16	53	88699	A brood of twenty-eight born at Brookfield_Zoo , near Chicago , ranged in_length from 22 to 33 - 1 2 inches and averaged 29 inches . 
3737	br-j11	16	54	88725	Lawrence_E_._Griffin gives measurements of nineteen young anacondas , presumably members of a brood , from `` South_America '' ; the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower_limit of the Brookfield brood and its average . 
3738	br-j11	16	55	88761	Raymond_L_._Ditmars had two broods that averaged 27 inches . 
3739	br-j11	16	56	88770	R_._R_._Mole and F_._W_._Urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the Orinoco estuaries . 
3740	br-j11	16	57	88794	William_Beebe reports 26 inches and 2.4 ounces ( this snake must have been emaciated ) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British_Guiana . 
3741	br-j11	16	58	88822	In contrast , Ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two young of a 19 - foot female as 38 inches , and four young were_born in London at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces . 
3742	br-j11	16	59	88867	Beebe had a 3 - foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces . 
3743	br-j11	16	60	88880	A difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size . 
3744	br-j11	17	61	88892	I have little information on the anaconda 's rate_of_growth . 
3745	br-j11	17	62	88902	Hans_Schweizer had one that increased from 19 - 1 2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years , and J_._J_._Quelch records a growth of from less_than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years . 
3746	br-j11	17	63	88940	It is very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate . 
3747	br-j11	18	64	88956	In 1948 , Afranio_do_Amaral , the noted Brazilian herpetologist , wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes . 
3748	br-j11	18	65	88975	He concluded that the anaconda 's maximum length is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meters , which would approximate from 39 to 42 feet ( 14 meters is slightly less that 46 feet ) . 
3749	br-j11	18	66	89012	Thus , his estimate lies between Oliver 's suggestion of at_least 37 feet and the 50 - foot `` monstrous freaks '' intimated by Heuvelmans . 
3750	br-j11	19	67	89038	The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern Colombia by Roberto_Lamon , a petroleum_geologist of the Richmond_Oil_Company , and reported in 1944 by Emmett_R_._Dunn . 
3751	br-j11	19	68	89067	However , as a field measurement , it is open_to question . 
3752	br-j11	19	69	89079	Oliver 's 37 - 1 2 feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable . 
3753	br-j11	19	70	89099	However , many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet . 
3754	br-j11	20	71	89116	It is possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong_to subspecies limited to a small area . 
3755	br-j11	20	72	89134	In snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of subspecies . 
3756	br-j11	21	73	89146	A Colombian female 's brood of sixteen boa_constrictors born in the Staten_Island_Zoo averaged 20 inches . 
3757	br-j11	21	74	89162	This birth length seems to be typical . 
3758	br-j11	21	75	89170	When some thirteen records of newly and recently born individuals are collated , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected . 
3759	br-j11	21	76	89195	The range is from 14 to 25 inches ; the former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a Central_American female ( see chapter on Laying , Brooding , Hatching , and Birth ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly born individual . 
3760	br-j11	21	77	89245	However , as so many of the records are not certainly based on newborn snakes , these data must be taken tentatively ; final conclusions will have_to await the measurements of broods from definite localities . 
3761	br-j11	22	78	89281	Alphonse_R_._Hoge 's measurements of several very young specimens from Brazil suggest that at_birth the female is slightly larger than the male . 
3762	br-j11	23	79	89303	I have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity . 
3763	br-j11	23	80	89316	Carl_Kauffeld has written to me of sexual_activity in February 1943 of young born in March 1940 . 
3764	br-j11	23	81	89333	One female , collected on an island off the coast of Nicaragua , was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long ) . 
3765	br-j11	23	82	89371	The female from Central_America which gave_birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long . 
3766	br-j11	24	83	89387	What data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; unfortunately , no_one has kept complete records of one individual , whereas many have been made for a very short period_of_time . 
3767	br-j11	24	84	89421	The results are too varied to allow generalization . 
3768	br-j12	1	1	89430	The bronchus and pulmonary_artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . 
3769	br-j12	1	2	89444	The pulmonary_vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) . 
3770	br-j12	1	3	89483	Another marked difference is noted here . 
3771	br-j12	1	4	89490	The pulmonary_artery , in_addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) . 
3772	br-j12	1	5	89525	The bronchial_artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply . 
3773	br-j12	1	6	89548	It does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph_nodes , the pulmonary_artery , the pulmonary_vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles - terminating in a common capillary_bed with the pulmonary_artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole . 
3774	br-j12	1	7	89591	No bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses were noted in this group . 
3775	br-j12	2	8	89601	Lung type 3 , ( fig. 3 ) is to some degree a composite of types 1 , and 2 , . 
3776	br-j12	2	9	89623	It is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules ; well defined , but haphazardly arranged , interlobular septa and a thick , remarkably vascular pleura ( fig. 9 ) . 
3777	br-j12	2	10	89656	The most distal airways are similar to those found in type 1 , , being composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchioles ( figs. 14 , 15 ) . 
3778	br-j12	2	11	89693	In this instance , because of incomplete septation , the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1 , . 
3779	br-j12	2	12	89724	Air drifts from one area to another are , therefore , conceivable . 
3780	br-j12	2	13	89737	Distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary_artery on one side and a pulmonary_vein on the other , as in type 1 , ( fig. 24 ) . 
3781	br-j12	2	14	89765	This relationship , however , is not maintained centrally . 
3782	br-j12	2	15	89775	Here the pulmonary_vein , as in type 2 , , is noted to draw away from the bronchus , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the hilum ( figs. 23 , 24 ) . 
3783	br-j12	2	16	89813	The bronchial_artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals . 
3784	br-j12	2	17	89829	As seen in types 1 , and 2 , , it supplies the hilar lymph_nodes , vasa_vasorum to the pulmonary_artery and vein , the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles . 
3785	br-j12	2	18	89859	As in type 1 , , it provides arterial blood to the interlobular septa , and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen ( figs. 9 , 10 ) . 
3786	br-j12	2	19	89890	This pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial_artery branches . 
3787	br-j12	2	20	89903	Such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at_once . 
3788	br-j12	2	21	89929	Some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial_arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches following along the pleural surface . 
3789	br-j12	2	22	89955	With completion of filling , net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches . 
3790	br-j12	2	23	89973	An unusual increase in the number of bronchial_arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted . 
3791	br-j12	2	24	89991	This was accounted_for primarily by the presence of a bronchial_artery closely following the pulmonary_artery . 
3792	br-j12	2	25	90006	The diameter of this bronchial_artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa_vasorum ( figs. 16 , 23 , 24 ) . 
3793	br-j12	2	26	90031	In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary_artery . 
3794	br-j12	2	27	90046	This vessel could be followed to the parenchyma where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary_bed ( figs. 17 , 18 ) . 
3795	br-j12	2	28	90072	Also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted : via the pleura ; through the interlobular septa ; and along the terminal bronchiole ( figs. 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 ) . 
3796	br-j12	2	29	90110	One bronchial arteriolar pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level ( fig. 26 ) . 
3797	br-j12	3	30	90128	It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made . 
3798	br-j12	3	31	90147	The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined . 
3799	br-j12	3	32	90167	However , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic considerations alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse . 
3800	br-j12	3	33	90191	The volume and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse . 
3801	br-j12	3	34	90216	Also , interlobular air drifts may be all_but nonexistent in the cow ; probably occur in the horse much_as in the human_being ; and , in contrast are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van_Allen and Lindskog , ' 31 ) . 
3802	br-j12	3	35	90270	A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at_present . 
3803	br-j12	4	36	90285	Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as_well . 
3804	br-j12	4	37	90311	For_example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related_to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such_as those found in types 1 , and 3 , . 
3805	br-j12	4	38	90358	One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse . 
3806	br-j12	4	39	90379	In_addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog . 
3807	br-j12	5	40	90417	Anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum , ' 54 ) in the human_being . 
3808	br-j12	5	41	90459	The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard_to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries . 
3809	br-j12	5	42	90482	As early as 1858 , Le_Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial_arteries in human_beings . 
3810	br-j12	5	43	90498	In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz . 
3811	br-j12	5	44	90507	The opposition to this point_of_view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller ( ' 50 ) . 
3812	br-j12	5	45	90526	Apparently , however , Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats , and he has been criticized for using pathologic human material in his normal study ( Loosli , ' 38 ) . 
3813	br-j12	5	46	90563	Although Miller noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other_than in the dog and cat ( Miller , ' 13 ; ' 25 ) . 
3814	br-j12	6	47	90618	The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial_artery as found in the horse is not clear . 
3815	br-j12	6	48	90637	However , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung . 
3816	br-j12	6	49	90663	The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues . 
3817	br-j12	6	50	90673	Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , ' 58 ) . 
3818	br-j12	6	51	90708	Therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial_artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus . 
3819	br-j12	6	52	90743	If this be true , the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial_arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema . 
3820	br-j12	6	53	90773	One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 , or 2 , . 
3821	br-j12	7	54	90794	The presence of normally occurring bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch , and thereafter by many others . 
3822	br-j12	7	55	90816	Nakamura ( ' 58 ) , Verloop ( ' 48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( ' 50 ) , von_Hayek ( ' 53 ) , and Tobin ( ' 52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human_being . 
3823	br-j12	7	56	90863	Miller ( ' 50 ) is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint . 
3824	br-j12	7	57	90876	In criticism of the latter 's views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all_of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level . 
3825	br-j12	7	58	90924	As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial_artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary_artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial_artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary_artery pressure . 
3826	br-j12	7	59	90976	Berry , Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this . 
3827	br-j12	7	60	90990	Our own studies in which bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial_artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary_artery or vein , and then by injecting the pulmonary_artery and vein afterwards . 
3828	br-j12	7	61	91027	It is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable . 
3829	br-j12	7	62	91052	This viewpoint is further supported by Verloop 's ( ' 48 ) demonstration of thickened bronchial_artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting_as valves . 
3830	br-j12	7	63	91079	In_other_words , the anastomoses between the bronchial_artery and pulmonary_artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts . 
3831	br-j12	8	64	91097	In_addition , little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard_to the normal existence of bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomoses . 
3832	br-j12	8	65	91118	Verloop ( ' 48 ; ' 49 ) found these shunts in the human_being but was unable to find them in rats . 
3833	br-j12	8	66	91141	Ellis , Grindlay and Edwards ( ' 52 ) also were unable to find them in rats . 
3834	br-j12	8	67	91159	Nakamura ( ' 58 ) was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by anatomic or physiologic methods , in dogs . 
3835	br-j12	8	68	91181	The possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is species dependent is therefore inferred . 
3836	br-j12	8	69	91198	Certainly , the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species . 
3837	br-j12	8	70	91223	It is , however , highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery shunts in certain species , especially the dog . 
3838	br-j12	9	71	91257	In_conclusion , these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology , pathology , and histology of mammalian lungs . 
3839	br-j12	9	72	91277	In_addition , a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary_emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent . 
3840	br-j12	9	73	91297	Also , for the present , great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man . 
3841	br-j12	9	74	91327	This is especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be used , in_view_of their marked anatomical differences from man . 
3842	br-j12	9	75	91351	Finally , it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable_to that of the human than any other presently known species . 
3843	br-j12	10	76	91379	The main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented . 
3844	br-j12	10	77	91393	A tabulation of these features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types . 
3845	br-j12	10	78	91410	Type 1 , is represented by the cow , sheep , and pig ; type 2 , , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; type 3 , , by the horse . 
3846	br-j12	10	79	91445	Lobularity is extremely well developed in type 1 , ; absent in type 2 , ; imperfectly developed in type 3 , . 
3847	br-j12	10	80	91468	The pleura and interlobular septa are thick in types 1 , and 3 , . 
3848	br-j12	10	81	91483	The pleura is extremely thin in type 2 , and septa are absent . 
3849	br-j12	10	82	91497	Arterial supply to the pleura in types 1 , and 3 , is provided by the bronchial_artery , and in type 2 , , by the pulmonary_artery . 
3850	br-j12	10	83	91525	In types 1 , , 2 , and 3 , the bronchial_artery terminates in a capillary_bed shared in common with the pulmonary_artery at the level of the distal bronchiole . 
3851	br-j12	10	84	91555	In type 3 , the bronchial_artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary_bed . 
3852	br-j12	10	85	91570	True terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal airways in types 1 , and 3 , , although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present . 
3853	br-j12	10	86	91602	Well developed respiratory bronchioles , on_the_other_hand , appear to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2 , . 
3854	br-j12	10	87	91625	In type 1 , the pulmonary_vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary_artery from the periphery to the hilum . 
3855	br-j12	10	88	91648	This maybe due_to the heavy interlobular connective_tissue barriers present . 
3856	br-j12	10	89	91658	In type 3 , this general relationship is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary_vein follows a more independent path to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2 , . 
3857	br-j13	1	1	91694	Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 . 
3858	br-j13	1	2	91715	First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . 
3859	br-j13	1	3	91733	In contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls . 
3860	br-j13	1	4	91777	The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early_childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . 
3861	br-j13	1	5	91806	Second , for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile . 
3862	br-j13	1	6	91832	Although the standard_deviation values on which spread of the lines are based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . 
3863	br-j13	1	7	91875	Third , the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children . 
3864	br-j13	2	8	91910	The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children . 
3865	br-j13	2	9	91925	It is convenient to classify a child 's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according_to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line . 
3866	br-j13	2	10	91983	When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according_to the position of the dot with_respect_to the vertical marking denoting the mean age . 
3867	br-j13	2	11	92020	Such classifications may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , reserving `` moderate '' for dots upon or close to the mean . 
3868	br-j13	3	12	92054	In the lower portion of each Chart , the Skeletal Age ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified . 
3869	br-j13	3	13	92079	There the middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the Maturity Series boys and girls . 
3870	br-j13	3	14	92101	The upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard_deviation , and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard_deviation . 
3871	br-j13	3	15	92122	Thus , a child 's Skeletal Age `` dots '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve . 
3872	br-j13	4	16	92173	To summarize the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity Chart : each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers . 
3873	br-j13	4	17	92205	First , the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting_of those from Hand , Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , and Foot . 
3874	br-j13	4	18	92232	The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand . 
3875	br-j13	4	19	92241	Second , the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round_bones of the five regions . 
3876	br-j13	4	20	92271	The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round_bones predominantly , since only two long_bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a region . 
3877	br-j13	4	21	92299	Third , the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level , Onset and Completion . 
3878	br-j13	4	22	92317	The lower portion utilizes the full_complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as_well_as their Onset and Completion . 
3879	br-j13	4	23	92337	Fourth , the two indicators are for_the_most_part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center . 
3880	br-j13	4	24	92363	The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood . 
3881	br-j13	5	25	92377	Onsets , Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile . 
3882	br-j13	5	26	92417	It may be assumed that differences in ratings due_to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according_to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body . 
3883	br-j13	5	27	92455	Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . 
3884	br-j13	5	28	92495	It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . 
3885	br-j13	5	29	92513	Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as_well_as Hand , it seems to be the method_of_choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood . 
3886	br-j13	5	30	92559	As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions - particularly the former - provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period . 
3887	br-j13	5	31	92593	Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress . 
3888	br-j13	6	32	92615	It was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2 . 
3889	br-j13	6	33	92656	As one approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have been constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 . 
3890	br-j13	6	34	92688	The differences between onset age and completion age with_respect_to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows . 
3891	br-j13	6	35	92714	The data for boy 34 appear in Figure 3 , and for girl 2 in Figure 4 . 
3892	br-j13	6	36	92732	The numbering system used in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers . 
3893	br-j13	7	37	92754	The `` dot '' on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the child 's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center . 
3894	br-j13	7	38	92786	The `` tip '' of the arrow represents extent of difference between the child 's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center . 
3895	br-j13	7	39	92813	Thus , the alignment of the `` dots '' and `` tips '' , respectively , indicate individual variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with_respect_to the mean values for these boys and girls . 
3896	br-j13	7	40	92850	The direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at Completion from the level at Onset . 
3897	br-j13	7	41	92876	When the `` dot '' and `` tip '' coincide , the classification used in this paper is `` same schedule '' . 
3898	br-j13	7	42	92899	The length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or acceleration at Completion over that at Onset , and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure , or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables . 
3899	br-j13	8	43	92955	The difference between the sequence of Onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering sequence in Figures 3 and 4 . 
3900	br-j13	8	44	92977	This difference is readily clarified by referring to Table 1 . 
3901	br-j13	8	45	92988	For_example , arrow 17 in Figure 3 portrays the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 , whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in Figure 4 . 
3902	br-j13	8	46	93020	For the boy , this epiphysis was markedly delayed at Onset but near the mean at Completion . 
3903	br-j13	8	47	93038	Thus , the Span of its ossification was shortened and the center 's ability to `` catch_up '' in ossification is demonstrated . 
3904	br-j13	8	48	93061	In contrast , for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at Onset and delayed at Completion . 
3905	br-j13	8	49	93079	Obviously , the slowing for her may have occurred at any point between Onset and Completion . 
3906	br-j13	8	50	93096	The Skeletal Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that slowing may have occurred for her during the prepubescent period . 
3907	br-j13	8	51	93120	Length of the shaft of these arrows may be evaluated according_to the standard_deviation values for each center in Table 1 . 
3908	br-j13	9	52	93141	We have attempted to simplify the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of each child - more_than 1700 values for the entire group - by constructing figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center . 
3909	br-j13	9	53	93198	Figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for each growth center . 
3910	br-j13	9	54	93216	Forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this monograph have been included in the Appendix . 
3911	br-j13	10	55	93247	The principles used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures 5 and 6 as_well_as all figures in the Appendix . 
3912	br-j13	10	56	93276	One growth center in a short_bone - distal phalanx of the second finger - was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short_bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage . 
3913	br-j13	10	57	93333	Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , dietary patterns , and health during adolescence . 
3914	br-j13	11	58	93358	The following summary , based on Figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with_respect_to the appropriate mean age for each growth center . 
3915	br-j13	11	59	93400	At the top of Figure 5 , for_example , the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according_to their mean and standard_deviation values in Table 1 . 
3916	br-j13	11	60	93436	The 34 arrows , denoting onset age plus completion age deviations , have been arrayed in an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 34 girls . 
3917	br-j13	11	61	93470	The growth center depicted here , in the distal phalanx of the second finger , is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short_bones . 
3918	br-j13	11	62	93497	The mean onset age was 25.3 months ( Table 1 ) , and the average Span of the osseous stage was 133 months . 
3919	br-j13	11	63	93521	The correlation ( Table 2 ) between onset age and completion age was + .50 , and that between onset age and Span was - .10 . 
3920	br-j13	11	64	93548	With due consideration for the limits of precision in assessing , expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 2 years , and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the Supplement , each arrow with a `` shaft length '' of four months or less was selected as indicating `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion , for this particular epiphysis . 
3921	br-j13	11	65	93623	Accordingly , girls 31 , 29 , 33 , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , 32 , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion . 
3922	br-j13	12	66	93677	It seems clear , from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls . 
3923	br-j13	12	67	93712	Accordingly , if epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche , early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule '' . 
3924	br-j13	12	68	93752	As an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion . 
3925	br-j13	12	69	93791	It is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group . 
3926	br-j13	13	70	93811	A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage . 
3927	br-j13	13	71	93843	Boys 32 , 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 had `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion ; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys . 
3928	br-j13	13	72	93883	Boy 34 , like girl 2 , did not have `` same schedule '' ; his arrow crosses the line denoting the mean . 
3929	br-j13	13	73	93907	The `` dot '' on his arrow indicates early Onset and the `` tip '' indicates relatively later Completion . 
3930	br-j13	14	74	93927	After the 42 figures had been drawn like Figures 5 and 6 , classifications of the onset ages and completion ages were summarized from them . 
3931	br-j14	1	1	93953	Interestingly enough , the effect of the digitalis_glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) . 
3932	br-j14	2	2	93987	The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as_yet completely understood . 
3933	br-j14	2	3	94003	However , the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems . 
3934	br-j14	2	4	94022	In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; De_Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) . 
3935	br-j14	2	5	94078	This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so_far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in_vitro by cell-free systems . 
3936	br-j14	2	6	94112	In_addition , the iodoamino_acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine . 
3937	br-j14	2	7	94127	If tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen_peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 ) . 
3938	br-j14	2	8	94158	It is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in_vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue . 
3939	br-j14	2	9	94187	On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to * * f and then to * * f as the active iodinating species . 
3940	br-j14	2	10	94215	In the thyroid_gland it appears that proteins ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated . 
3941	br-j14	2	11	94238	Iodination of tyrosine , however , is not enough for the synthesis of hormone . 
3942	br-j14	2	12	94253	The mono - and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine . 
3943	br-j14	2	13	94267	The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail with non-enzymatic systems in_vitro and can be simulated by certain di-iodotyrosine analogues ( Pitt-Rivers and James , 1958 ) . 
3944	br-j14	2	14	94298	There is so_far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under enzymatic control . 
3945	br-j14	3	15	94314	The chemical nature of the iodocompounds is discussed below ( pp. 76 et_seq. ) . 
3946	br-j14	4	16	94329	Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin . 
3947	br-j14	4	17	94341	Its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems , nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in_vitro been unequivocally proven . 
3948	br-j14	4	18	94366	There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination , for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments ( Wolff , Robbins and Rall , 1959 ) . 
3949	br-j14	4	19	94419	Similar findings have been noted in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzymes , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide . 
3950	br-j14	4	20	94443	In_addition , depending_on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine . 
3951	br-j14	5	21	94459	Since the circulating thyroid_hormones are the amino_acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid_gland for their release from proteins before secretion . 
3952	br-j14	5	22	94494	The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid . 
3953	br-j14	5	23	94508	One of the proteases has pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( McQuillan , Stanley and Trikojus , 1954 ; Alpers , Robbins and Rall , 1955 ) . 
3954	br-j14	5	24	94541	The finding that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid_glands from TSH treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in_vivo . 
3955	br-j14	5	25	94568	There is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known . 
3956	br-j14	5	26	94592	A study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates ( Alpers , Petermann and Rall , 1956 ) . 
3957	br-j14	5	27	94629	Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes . 
3958	br-j14	5	28	94638	A microsomal de-iodinase with a pH optimum of around 8 , and requiring reduced triphosphopyridine_nucleotide for activity , has been identified in the thyroid ( Stanbury , 1957 ) . 
3959	br-j14	5	29	94668	This de-iodinating enzyme is effective against mono - and di-iodotyrosine , but does not de-iodinate thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine . 
3960	br-j14	5	30	94687	It is assumed that the iodine released from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid , where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin . 
3961	br-j14	5	31	94715	The thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood_stream . 
3962	br-j14	5	32	94732	It has been shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine , but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong . 
3963	br-j14	5	33	94752	It has been suggested that the plasma thyroxine binding proteins , which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( Ingbar and Freinkel , 1957 ) . 
3964	br-j14	6	34	94785	Antithyroid drugs are of two general types . 
3965	br-j14	6	35	94793	One type has a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate perchlorate fluoroboride type . 
3966	br-j14	6	36	94807	This ion inhibits thyroid_hormone synthesis by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid . 
3967	br-j14	6	37	94821	It does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as_such . 
3968	br-j14	6	38	94832	The other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil . 
3969	br-j14	6	39	94845	These drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism , but they inhibit organification . 
3970	br-j14	6	40	94861	The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked_out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin ( Astwood , 1954 ) . 
3971	br-j14	6	41	94899	On_the_other_hand , there are a_few antithyroid drugs of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine . 
3972	br-j14	6	42	94932	Any of the antithyroid drugs , of either type , if given in large enough doses for a long period_of_time will cause goitre , owing to inhibition of thyroid_hormone synthesis , with production of hypothyroidism . 
3973	br-j14	6	43	94968	The anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased output of TSH , causing the thyroid to enlarge . 
3974	br-j14	6	44	94989	The effect of drugs that act_on the iodide concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet . 
3975	br-j14	6	45	95014	The antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type , however , are not antagonised by such means . 
3976	br-j14	6	46	95031	Besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol types , certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods . 
3977	br-j14	6	47	95051	The most conclusively identified is L - 5 - vinyl - 2 - thio_oxazolidone , which was isolated from rutabaga ( Greer , 1950 ) . 
3978	br-j14	6	48	95077	It is presumed to occur in other members of the Brassica family . 
3979	br-j14	6	49	95090	There is some evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development of goitre , particularly in Tasmania and Australia ( Clements and Wishart , 1956 ) . 
3980	br-j14	6	50	95121	There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen , which is then secreted in the milk . 
3981	br-j14	7	51	95153	Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid_gland . 
3982	br-j14	7	52	95182	In the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( Money , Rall and Rawson , 1952 ; Stanbury , Brownell , Riggs , Perinetti , Itoiz , and Del_Castillo , 1954 ) . 
3983	br-j14	7	53	95228	In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 | mg per day . 
3984	br-j14	7	54	95255	With lower levels , thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine . 
3985	br-j14	7	55	95281	Further , the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the thyroid_hormone de-iodinated peripherally . 
3986	br-j14	7	56	95298	In the presence of a low iodine intake , thyroglobulin labelled in_vivo with * * f is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal , the amounts of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced . 
3987	br-j14	7	57	95333	This appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin . 
3988	br-j14	7	58	95356	If the deficiency persists long enough , it is reasonable to suppose that the * * f label will reflect the * * f distribution in the thyroglobulin . 
3989	br-j14	7	59	95385	Similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping , or organification , or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis . 
3990	br-j14	8	60	95411	The name thyroid-stimulating_hormone ( TSH ) has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary_gland of all species of animal so_far tested for its presence . 
3991	br-j14	8	61	95439	The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic_hormone . 
3992	br-j14	8	62	95449	At the present_time we do not know by what biochemical_mechanism TSH acts_on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of * * f . 
3993	br-j14	8	63	95516	Here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood . 
3994	br-j14	8	64	95539	Brown ( 1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying TSH , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject . 
3995	br-j14	9	65	95568	As long_ago as 1851 it was pointed_out by Niepce ( 1851 ) that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid . 
3996	br-j14	9	66	95592	. 
3997	br-j14	9	67	95593	This connection was clarified by Smith and Smith ( 1922 ) , who showed that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary_glands could re-activate the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles . 
3998	br-j14	9	68	95623	The first attempts to isolate TSH came a decade later , when Janssen and Loeser ( 1931 ) used trichloroacetic_acid to separate the soluble TSH from insoluble impurities . 
3999	br-j14	9	69	95652	After their work other investigators applied salt fractionation techniques to the problem , as_well_as fractionation with organic solvents , such_as acetone . 
4000	br-j14	9	70	95674	Albert ( 1949 ) has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this period , from 1931 to 1945 , were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material . 
4001	br-j14	9	71	95711	Much of this work has been reviewed by White ( 1944 ) and by Albert ( 1949 ) . 
4002	br-j14	9	72	95730	Developments up_to about 1957 have been discussed by Sonenberg ( 1958 ) . 
4003	br-j14	10	73	95743	In the last few years , the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating TSH has led to further purification ( Bates and Condliffe , 1960 ; Pierce , Carsten and Wynston , 1960 ) . 
4004	br-j14	10	74	95784	The most active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in potency , composition and physical_properties . 
4005	br-j14	11	75	95806	Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood . 
4006	br-j14	11	76	95817	First , is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored ? 
4007	br-j14	11	77	95841	Second , what is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction ? 
4008	br-j14	11	78	95867	It is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary TSH if the fragmentary chemical information about blood TSH is to be discussed rationally . 
4009	br-j14	11	79	95892	The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) . 
4010	br-j14	11	80	95930	Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH , or is , alternatively , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible_for the blood activity with pituitary TSH . 
4011	br-j14	12	81	95988	In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them . 
4012	br-j14	12	82	96011	The introduction of the United_States_Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid stimulating activity have made_it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time . 
4013	br-j14	12	83	96049	We should_like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in_terms_of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units . 
4014	br-j14	12	84	96074	For_the_most_part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard . 
4015	br-j14	13	85	96092	The international unit ( u . ) , adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories ( Mussett and Perry , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the International_Standard_Preparation . 
4016	br-j14	13	86	96135	The international unit is equipotent with the USP unit adopted in 1952 , which was defined as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the USP reference substance . 
4017	br-j15	1	1	96166	Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use . 
4018	br-j15	1	2	96192	Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups . 
4019	br-j15	1	3	96232	The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia . 
4020	br-j15	2	4	96260	This patient was a 65 - year old white male accountant who entered the New_York_Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . 
4021	br-j15	3	5	96295	In 1953 the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood_transfusions were given over a period of 4 years . 
4022	br-j15	3	6	96316	Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis '' suggestive_of myelofibrosis . 
4023	br-j15	3	7	96341	No additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily . 
4024	br-j15	3	8	96372	This medication was continued until February , 1958 . 
4025	br-j15	4	9	96381	In February , 1958 , the patient suffered a myocardial_infarction complicated by pulmonary edema . 
4026	br-j15	4	10	96396	Additional findings at this time included cardiomegaly , peripheral arteriosclerosis_obliterans , and cholelithiasis . 
4027	br-j15	4	11	96410	The hemoglobin was 11.6 gm. . 
4028	br-j15	4	12	96416	Therapy included digitalization and anticoagulation . 
4029	br-j15	4	13	96422	Later , chlorothiazide and salt restriction became necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure . 
4030	br-j15	5	14	96439	Because of increasing anemia , triamcinolone , 8 mg. daily , was started on Feb. 23 , 1958 , and was continued until july , 1958 . 
4031	br-j15	5	15	96466	In september , 1958 , the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which was concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia ; the hemoglobin was 10.6 gm. . 
4032	br-j15	5	16	96493	In an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating the bone_marrow and controlling any hemolytic component , triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was begun on Sept. 26 , 1958 , and continued until Feb. 18 , 1959 . 
4033	br-j15	5	17	96533	At_first the patient felt stronger , and the hemoglobin rose to 13.8 gm. , but on Oct. 20 , 1958 , he complained of `` caving_in '' in his knees . 
4034	br-j15	5	18	96564	By Nov. 8 , 1958 , weakness , specifically involving the pelvic and thigh musculature , was pronounced , and a common complaint was `` difficulty in stepping up on to curbs '' . 
4035	br-j15	5	19	96598	Prednisone , 30 mg. daily , was substituted for triamcinolone from Nov. 22 until Dec. 1 , 1958 , without any improvement in the weakness . 
4036	br-j15	5	20	96624	Serum potassium at this time was 3.8 mEq. per liter , and the hemoglobin was 13.9 gm. By Dec. 1 , 1958 , the weakness in the pelvic and quadriceps muscle groups was appreciably worse , and it became difficult for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position . 
4037	br-j15	5	21	96677	Triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was resumed and maintained until Feb. 18 , 1959 . 
4038	br-j15	5	22	96693	Chlorothiazide was omitted for a 2 - week period , but there was no change in the muscle weakness . 
4039	br-j15	6	23	96713	At this time a detailed neuromuscular examination revealed diffuse muscle atrophy that was moderate in the hands and feet , but more marked in the shoulders , hips , and pelvic_girdle , with hypoactive deep tendon reflexes . 
4040	br-j15	6	24	96751	No fasciculations or sensory defects were found . 
4041	br-j15	6	25	96759	Electromyography revealed no evidence of lower motor_neuron disease . 
4042	br-j15	6	26	96768	Thyroid function tests yielded normal results . 
4043	br-j15	6	27	96775	The protein bound iodine was 6.6 | mg. % , and the radioactive iodine uptake over the thyroid_gland was 46 % in 24 hours , with a conversion ratio of 12 % . 
4044	br-j15	6	28	96808	A Schilling_test demonstrated normal absorption of vitamin * * f . 
4045	br-j15	6	29	96819	In February , 1959 , during the second admission to The New_York_Hospital , a biopsy specimen of the left gastrocnemius showed striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nuclei and shrunken muscle_fibers in several sections . 
4046	br-j15	6	30	96854	Serial serum potassium levels remained normal ; the serum glutamic_oxaloacetic_transaminase was 10 units per ml. per min. . 
4047	br-j15	6	31	96872	The clinical impression at this time was either muscular_dystrophy or polymyositis . 
4048	br-j15	7	32	96884	On Feb. 12 , 1959 , purified corticotropin ( ACTH_Gel ) , 20 units daily intramuscularly , was started but had_to be discontinued 3 weeks later because of excessive fluid retention . 
4049	br-j15	7	33	96916	From March 3 to May 1 , 1949 , the patient was maintained on dexamethasone , 3 to 6 mg. daily . 
4050	br-j15	7	34	96938	In May 1959 , prednisone , 30 mg. daily , replaced the dexamethasone . 
4051	br-j15	7	35	96952	Muscle weakness did not improve , and the patient needed first a cane , then crutches . 
4052	br-j15	7	36	96969	In_spite of normal thyroid function tests , a trial of propylthiouracil , 400 mg. daily for one week , was given but served only to intensify muscle weakness . 
4053	br-j15	7	37	96998	Repeated attempts to withdraw steroids entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted , as_well_as fever , malaise , anorexia , anxiety , and an exacerbation of the anemia . 
4054	br-j15	7	38	97028	These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism . 
4055	br-j15	8	39	97038	Severe back pain in June , 1959 , prompted a third hospital admission . 
4056	br-j15	8	40	97052	Extensive osteoporosis with partial collapse of D8 was found . 
4057	br-j15	8	41	97062	A high protein diet , calcium_lactate supplements , and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness . 
4058	br-j15	9	42	97084	The terminal hospital admission on June 27 , 1959 , was necessitated by continued weakness and debility complicated by urinary retention and painful thrombosed hemorrhoids . 
4059	br-j15	9	43	97110	X-ray_films of the vertebral_column showed progression of the demineralization . 
4060	br-j15	9	44	97120	On July 4 , 1959 , the patient developed marked abdominal pain and distension , went into shock , and died . 
4061	br-j15	10	45	97142	The body was that of a well developed , somewhat debilitated white_man weighing 108 lb. There were bilateral pterygia and arcus_senilis , and the mouth was edentulous . 
4062	br-j15	11	46	97170	The heart weighed 510 gm. , and at the outflow tracts the left and right_ventricles measured 19 and 3 mm. , respectively . 
4063	br-j15	11	47	97193	The coronary_arteries were sclerotic and diffusely narrowed throughout their courses , and the right_coronary_artery was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm. distal to its origin . 
4064	br-j15	11	48	97222	The myocardium of the posterior base of the left_ventricle was replaced by gray scar tissue over a 7.5 cm. area . 
4065	br-j15	11	49	97243	The valves were normal except for thin yellow plaques on the inferior surface of the mitral leaflets . 
4066	br-j15	11	50	97261	Microscopically , sections from the posterior base of the left_ventricle of the heart showed several large areas of replacement of muscle by fibrous_tissue . 
4067	br-j15	11	51	97285	In_addition , other sections contained focal areas of recent myocardial necrosis that were infiltrated with neutrophils . 
4068	br-j15	11	52	97302	Many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied and had large , irregular , basophilic nuclei . 
4069	br-j15	11	53	97318	The intima of the larger coronary_arteries was thickened by fibrous_tissue containing fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells . 
4070	br-j15	12	54	97335	The intimal surface of the aorta was covered with confluent , yellow-brown , hard , friable plaques along its entire course , and there was a marked narrowing of the orifices of the large major visceral arteries . 
4071	br-j15	12	55	97373	In particular , the orifices of the right renal and celiac_arteries were virtually occluded , and both calcified common_iliac_arteries were completely occluded . 
4072	br-j15	13	56	97396	The lungs weighed together 950 gm. . 
4073	br-j15	13	57	97403	On the surfaces of both lungs there were emphysematous blebs measuring up_to 3 cm. in diameter . 
4074	br-j15	13	58	97420	The parenchyma was slightly hyperemic in the apex of the left lung , and there were several firm , gray , fibrocalcific nodules measuring as large as 3 mm. . 
4075	br-j15	13	59	97450	Microscopically , there was emphysema , fibrosis , and vascular congestion . 
4076	br-j15	13	60	97462	Macrophages laden with brown pigment were seen in some of the alveoli , and the intima of some of the small arteries was thickened by fibrous_tissue . 
4077	br-j15	14	61	97489	The firm red spleen weighed 410 gm. , and its surface was mottled by discrete , small patches of white material . 
4078	br-j15	14	62	97511	The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids were prominent , and many contained large quantities of hemosiderin . 
4079	br-j15	14	63	97528	Some of the sinusoids contained large_numbers of nucleated red_cells , and cells of the granulocytic series were found in small numbers . 
4080	br-j15	14	64	97550	There were slight fibrosis and marked arteriolosclerosis . 
4081	br-j15	15	65	97558	The liver weighed 2090 gm. , was brown in color , and the cut surface was mottled by irregular pale areas . 
4082	br-j15	15	66	97580	Microscopically , there was hyperemia of the central veins , and there was some atrophy of adjacent parenchyma . 
4083	br-j15	15	67	97599	Some liver cord cells contained vacuolated cytoplasm , while others had small amounts of brown hemosiderin pigment . 
4084	br-j15	16	68	97617	The gallbladder contained about 40 cc. of green brown bile and 3 smooth , dark-green calculi measuring up_to 1 cm. in diameter . 
4085	br-j15	17	69	97640	The mucosa of the stomach was atrophic and irregularly blackened over a 14 cm. area . 
4086	br-j15	17	70	97656	The small and large_intestines were filled with gas , and the jejunum was dilated to about 2 times its normal circumference . 
4087	br-j15	17	71	97678	The small_intestine and colon contained approximately 300 cc. of foul-smelling , sanguineous material , and the mucosa throughout was hyperemic and mottled green brown . 
4088	br-j15	17	72	97703	A careful search failed to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric vessels . 
4089	br-j15	17	73	97717	Microscopically , the mucosa of the stomach showed extensive cytolysis and contained large_numbers of Gram-negative bacterial rods . 
4090	br-j15	17	74	97735	The submucosa was focally infiltrated with neutrophils . 
4091	br-j15	17	75	97743	The mucosa of the jejunum and ileum showed similar changes , and in some areas the submucosa was edematous and contained considerable numbers of neutrophils . 
4092	br-j15	17	76	97769	Some of the small vessels were filled with fibrin thrombi , and there was extensive interstitial hemorrhage . 
4093	br-j15	17	77	97787	A section of the colon revealed intense hyperemia and extensive focal ulcerations of the mucosa , associated with much fibrin and many neutrophils . 
4094	br-j15	17	78	97811	Cultures taken from the jejunum yielded Monilia_albicans , Pseudomonas_pyocanea , Aerobacter_aerogenes , and Streptococcus_anhemolyticus . 
4095	br-j15	18	79	97826	The kidneys were pale and weighed right , 110 gm. , and left , 230 gm. . 
4096	br-j15	18	80	97843	The surfaces were coarsely and finely granular and punctuated by clear , fluid filled cysts measuring up_to 3 cm. in diameter . 
4097	br-j15	18	81	97865	On the surface of the right kidney there were also 2 yellow , firm , friable raised areas measuring up_to 2 cm. in diameter . 
4098	br-j15	18	82	97890	Microscopically , both kidneys showed many small cortical scars in which there was glomerular and interstitial fibrosis , tubular atrophy , and an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells . 
4099	br-j15	18	83	97920	Occasional tubules contained hyaline casts admixed with neutrophils . 
4100	br-j15	18	84	97929	Throughout , there were marked arteriolosclerosis and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles . 
4101	br-j15	18	85	97942	These changes were more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left . 
4102	br-j15	18	86	97957	In_addition , there were 2 small papillary adenomas in the right kidney . 
4103	br-j15	19	87	97970	The bone of the vertebral bodies , ribs , and sternum was soft and was easily compressed . 
4104	br-j15	19	88	97988	The marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and showed areas of fatty replacement . 
4105	br-j15	19	89	98003	Microscopically , there were many areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity . 
4106	br-j15	19	90	98017	The cells of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series were normal except for their numbers . 
4107	br-j15	19	91	98035	There was no evidence of fibrosis . 
4108	br-j15	19	92	98042	The muscles of the extremities , chest wall , neck , and abdominal wall were soft , pale , and atrophic . 
4109	br-j15	20	93	98064	Microscopic studies of the gastrocnemius , pectoralis_major , transversus_abdominis , biceps_brachii , and diaphragm showed atrophy as_well_as varying degrees of injury ranging from swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle_fibers . 
4110	br-j15	20	94	98097	These changes were most marked in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less evident in the pectoralis , diaphragm , and transversus . 
4111	br-j15	21	95	98119	In the gastrocnemius and biceps there were many swollen and homogeneous necrotic fibers such_as that shown in Figure 2 . 
4112	br-j15	21	96	98139	Such swollen fibers were deeply eosinophilic , contained a_few pyknotic nuclei , and showed loss of cross striations , obliteration of myofibrils , and prominent vacuolization . 
4113	br-j15	21	97	98166	The necrosis often involved only a portion of the length of a given fiber , and usually the immediately adjacent fibers were normal . 
4114	br-j15	21	98	98190	As shown in Figure 3 , the protoplasm of other fibers was pale , granular , or flocculated and invaded by phagocytes . 
4115	br-j15	21	99	98213	Inflammatory cells were strikingly absent . 
4116	br-j15	21	100	98219	In_association_with these changes in the fibers , there were striking alterations in the muscle nuclei . 
4117	br-j15	21	101	98235	These were increased both in number and in size , contained prominent nucleoli , and were distributed throughout the fiber ( Figs. 2 - 5 ) . 
4118	br-j15	21	102	98262	In contrast to the nuclear changes described above , another change in muscle nuclei was seen , usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than normal but that showed distinct cross striations and myofibrillae . 
4119	br-j15	21	103	98298	The nuclei of these fibers , as is shown in Figures 3 and 4 , showed remarkable proliferation and were closely approximated , forming a chain like structure at either the center or the periphery of the fiber . 
4120	br-j15	21	104	98337	Individual nuclei were usually oval to round , though occasionally elongated , and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic . 
4121	br-j15	21	105	98356	At_times , clumps of 10 to 15 closely packed nuclei were also observed . 
4122	br-j15	21	106	98370	Occasionally there were small basophilic fibers that were devoid_of myofibrillae and contained many vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli ( Fig. 5 ) . 
4123	br-j15	21	107	98393	These were thought to represent regenerating fibers . 
4124	br-j15	21	108	98401	Trichrome stains failed to show fibrosis in the involved muscles . 
4125	br-j15	21	109	98412	In all_of the sections examined , the arterioles and small arteries were essentially normal . 
4126	br-j16	1	1	98427	In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed_through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet_clover stems or crown_gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium_tumefaciens ( E._F._Smith + Townsend ) Conn , on sweet_clover stems . 
4127	br-j16	1	2	98499	( 2 ) The conjugates as_well_as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30_minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet_clover stems . 
4128	br-j16	1	3	98525	The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of * * f in * * f to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80 % saturation with * * f . 
4129	br-j16	1	4	98557	The precipitate was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution of * * f , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled_water till free from ammonium_ions , and lyophilized using liquid_nitrogen . 
4130	br-j16	1	5	98599	( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl_acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) . 
4131	br-j16	1	6	98625	( 4 ) The conjugates were passed_through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE - ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing * * f potassium phosphate and * * f . 
4132	br-j16	2	7	98659	The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et_al. ( 1951 ) . 
4133	br-j16	2	8	98678	Root and stem tumors from sweet_clover plants infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid_nitrogen , embedded in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 | m in a cryostat maintained at - 16 ` to - 20 ` . 
4134	br-j16	2	9	98718	The sections were mounted on cold slides smeared with Haupts ' adhesive ( Johansen , 1940 ) in earlier experiments , and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components reported by Schramm and Rottger ( 1959 ) . 
4135	br-j16	2	10	98760	The latter adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory . 
4136	br-j16	2	11	98771	The sections were then thawed by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for 30_minutes ; until used they were stored for as_long_as 2 weeks . 
4137	br-j16	3	12	98801	The sections were fixed in acetone for 15_minutes and dried at 37 ` for 30_minutes . 
4138	br-j16	3	13	98817	Some of them were then covered with a drop of * * f in a moist chamber at 24 ` for 30 - 40 minutes . 
4139	br-j16	3	14	98843	As controls other sections were similarly covered with NS . 
4140	br-j16	3	15	98853	Sections were then washed with PBS for 15 - 30_minutes . 
4141	br-j16	3	16	98864	After blotting_out most of the saline around the sections , a drop of * * f was layered over each of the sections , allowed to react for 30_minutes , and then washed with PBS for 15 - 30_minutes . 
4142	br-j16	3	17	98904	After blotting_out most of the liquid around the sections , the latter were mounted in buffered glycerine ( 7 parts glycerine to 3 parts of PBS ) . 
4143	br-j16	4	18	98932	After drying the sections under the fan , fixing in acetone , and drying at 37 ` as in the indirect method , the sections were treated with conjugated * * f or * * f ( undiluted unless mentioned otherwise ) for 5 - 30_minutes . 
4144	br-j16	4	19	98979	As controls , other sections were similarly treated with * * f or conjugated antiserum to the New_York strain of potato_yellow-dwarf_virus ( Wolcyrz and Black , 1956 ) . 
4145	br-j16	4	20	99008	The sections were then washed with PBS for 15 - 30_minutes and mounted in buffered glycerine . 
4146	br-j16	5	21	99025	Stained or unstained sections were examined under dark_field_illumination in a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp ( Osram_HBO 200 ) . 
4147	br-j16	5	22	99049	The light_beam from the lamp was filtered through a half standard thickness Corning 1840 filter . 
4148	br-j16	5	23	99065	In the eyepiece a Wratten 2 B filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet_light . 
4149	br-j16	5	24	99081	A red filter , Zeiss barrier filter with the code ( Schott ) designation BG 23 , was also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence . 
4150	br-j16	6	25	99117	In the first few experiments * * f was passed_through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet_clover tissue powder . 
4151	br-j16	6	26	99141	The intermediate sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder . 
4152	br-j16	6	27	99152	Sections of sweet_clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1 : 10 solution of * * f for 30_minutes , washed in buffered saline for 15_minutes , stained with * * f for 30_minutes , and washed for 15_minutes in PBS . 
4153	br-j16	6	28	99195	Such sections showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells of the pseudophloem tissue ( Lee and Black , 1955 ) . 
4154	br-j16	6	29	99217	This specific fluorescence was readily distinguished from the light_green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive sections stained with 1 : 10 dilution of NS and * * f or with * * f alone . 
4155	br-j16	6	30	99250	Unstained sections mounted in buffered glycerine or sections treated only with NS or * * f did not show such green fluorescence . 
4156	br-j16	6	31	99273	Sections of crown_gall tissue similarly stained with either * * f and * * f or NS and * * f also showed only the light_green nonspecific fluorescence . 
4157	br-j16	6	32	99302	However , the nonspecific staining by the * * f in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of WTV antigen . 
4158	br-j16	7	33	99332	Two absorptions of * * f with ethyl_acetate or two absorptions of * * f ( which had been passed_through Dowex-2-chloride ) , NS and * * f with crown_gall tissue powder , or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining . 
4159	br-j16	7	34	99378	Treatment of all the sera with sweet_clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence , especially when the treated conjugate was diluted to 1 : 2 with 0.85 % saline . 
4160	br-j16	7	35	99407	In all the above procedures , when the intermediate sera were diluted to 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 with 0.85 % saline , the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduced , whereas , a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1 : 500 or diluting the * * f to 1 : 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence . 
4161	br-j16	7	36	99469	Rinsing the sections with PBS before layering the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction . 
4162	br-j16	7	37	99486	In_addition to other treatments , treating the sections with normal sheep serum for half an hour before layering * * f did not reduce nonspecific staining . 
4163	br-j16	8	38	99513	The only treatment by which nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily removed was by passing the conjugate through a DEAE-cellulose column . 
4164	br-j16	8	39	99534	When 1 ml of conjugate was passed_through a column ( * * f ) , the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments , and very little in others . 
4165	br-j16	8	40	99575	In the latter cases an additional treatment of the DEAE cellulose treated * * f with 50 mg of sweet_clover stem tissue powder further improved the specificity . 
4166	br-j16	8	41	99603	After these treatments the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown_gall sweet_clover tissues or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable from the bright yellow-green specific staining . 
4167	br-j16	8	42	99634	With this purified conjugate the best staining procedure consisted_of treating the sections with 1 : 10 dilution of * * f for 30_minutes , washing with PBS for 15_minutes , staining with * * f for 30_minutes , and washing with PBS for 15_minutes . 
4168	br-j16	8	43	99679	The specificity of staining in WTV tumors with * * f and * * f but not with NS and * * f or with antiserum to potato_yellow-dwarf_virus and * * f , and the absence of such staining in crown_gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover , indicate that an antigen of WTV was being stained . 
4169	br-j16	9	44	99735	* * f was first conjugated with 50 mg of FITC per gram of globulin . 
4170	br-j16	9	45	99751	This conjugate was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method . 
4171	br-j16	9	46	99775	In all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still present although it was still distinguishable from specific fluorescence . 
4172	br-j16	10	47	99796	In later experiments , * * f and * * f were prepared by conjugating 8 mg of FITC per gram of globulin . 
4173	br-j16	10	48	99820	These conjugates * * f had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate ( with 50 mg FITC per gram of globulin ) while the specific staining was similar in both cases . 
4174	br-j16	10	49	99854	Nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily eliminated by passing these conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column as described for * * f . 
4175	br-j16	10	50	99875	The best staining procedure with this purified * * f consisted_of staining with the conjugate for 30_minutes and washing in PBS for 15_minutes . 
4176	br-j16	10	51	99899	The specificity of staining with * * f was established as_follows : * * f specifically stained tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet_clover stems or of crown_gall tumor tissue from sweet_clover . 
4177	br-j16	10	52	99933	Sections of tumors incited by WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum or conjugated antiserum to potato_yellow-dwarf_virus . 
4178	br-j16	11	53	99953	After passing * * f through DEAE-cellulose , the titer of antibodies to WTV in the specific fraction was 1 : 4 of the titer before such passage ( precipitin ring tests by R._F._Whitcomb ) ; but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 : 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining . 
4179	br-j16	11	54	100006	This indicates that increase in specificity of * * f after passing it through DEAE-cellulose was not merely due_to dilution . 
4180	br-j16	12	55	100027	Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated * * f and * * f , although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells , was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in_spite_of many attempts with black_and_white and color photography . 
4181	br-j16	12	56	100072	This was chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells . 
4182	br-j16	12	57	100085	The autofluorescence from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant . 
4183	br-j16	13	58	100098	Results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors . 
4184	br-j16	13	59	100124	The virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue . 
4185	br-j16	13	60	100134	Frequently a_few isolated thick walled cells or , rarely , groups of such cells in the xylem region , were also specifically stained , but there was no such staining in epidermis , cortex , most xylem cells , ray cells , or pith . 
4186	br-j16	14	61	100179	Within the pseudophloem cells the distribution of WTV antigen was irregular in the cytoplasm . 
4187	br-j16	14	62	100194	No antigen was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells . 
4188	br-j16	14	63	100207	These areas are thought to represent the nuclei . 
4189	br-j16	14	64	100216	In some tumor sections small spherical bodies , possibly inclusion_bodies ( Littau and Black , 1952 ) stained more intensely than the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained more antigen . 
4190	br-j16	14	65	100247	In all cases studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not contain detectable amounts of WTV antigen . 
4191	br-j16	15	66	100270	In both the direct and indirect methods of staining , the conjugates had nonspecifically staining fractions . 
4192	br-j16	15	67	100287	In the indirect method , this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light_green even when stained with NS and * * f or with * * f only . 
4193	br-j16	15	68	100320	In the direct method , * * f , not further treated , stained certain tissues of healthy sweet_clover stems nonspecifically and WTV tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable * * f . 
4194	br-j16	15	69	100354	After * * f and * * f were passed_through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet_clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present . 
4195	br-j16	15	70	100391	Treatment of the conjugates with ethyl_acetate , and the conjugates ( which had been passed_through Dowex-2-chloride ) with mouse liver powder , sweet_clover crown_gall tissue powder , or healthy sweet_clover proteins did not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates . 
4196	br-j16	15	71	100433	Such treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating nonspecific staining in several other systems ( Coons , 1958 ) . 
4197	br-j16	15	72	100456	Schramm and Rottger ( 1959 ) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant_tissues with fluorescein isocyanate labeled antiserum to tobacco_mosaic_virus . 
4198	br-j16	15	73	100479	The reason for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known . 
4199	br-j16	16	74	100501	In our work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in_order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet_clover tissue powder . 
4200	br-j16	17	75	100544	The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a_few thick walled cells in the xylem region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors . 
4201	br-j16	17	76	100589	A study of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm . 
4202	br-j16	18	77	100611	Wound_tumor_virus is a leafhopper transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation ( Black , 1944 ; Brakke et_al. , 1954 ) . 
4203	br-j16	18	78	100634	The concentration and apparent localization of the WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in_order_to infect plants . 
4204	br-j17	1	1	100673	Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend_on individual experience and are aroused in man , in_addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex . 
4205	br-j17	1	2	100708	In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral_cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated . 
4206	br-j17	1	3	100732	Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions . 
4207	br-j17	1	4	100749	Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional_arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . 
4208	br-j17	1	5	100779	A previously extinguished conditioned_reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges . 
4209	br-j17	2	6	100801	It seems to follow that by_and_large an antagonism exists between the paleo - and the neocortex as_far_as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism . 
4210	br-j17	2	7	100839	In_addition , the neocortical hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates . 
4211	br-j17	2	8	100866	But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such_as the rat , sex_activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral_brain is enhanced by the neocortex . 
4212	br-j17	2	9	100892	MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral_brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic_brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related_to fight and flight and also on sexual functions . 
4213	br-j17	2	10	100934	It should be added that in man neocortical hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity . 
4214	br-j17	3	11	100966	Previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response . 
4215	br-j17	3	12	100981	The visceral_brain as_well_as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory , but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper . 
4216	br-j17	4	13	101004	After this brief discussion of neo - , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relations , let us return once_more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance . 
4217	br-j17	4	14	101035	Facilitatory processes take_place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways . 
4218	br-j17	4	15	101048	Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges . 
4219	br-j17	4	16	101077	On_the_other_hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored . 
4220	br-j17	4	17	101113	Apparently , a positive_feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral_cortex . 
4221	br-j17	4	18	101126	Consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level , the lessened hypothalamic cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges . 
4222	br-j17	4	19	101164	Obviously , a vicious_cycle develops . 
4223	br-j17	4	20	101170	This tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways . 
4224	br-j17	4	21	101186	It is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism . 
4225	br-j17	5	22	101203	Before we comment further on these pathological conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness . 
4226	br-j17	5	23	101231	Thus , a low intensity of hypothalamic cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition . 
4227	br-j17	5	24	101265	Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous_system . 
4228	br-j17	5	25	101321	With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur . 
4229	br-j17	5	26	101337	Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus . 
4230	br-j17	5	27	101382	Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals . 
4231	br-j17	6	28	101397	Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect . 
4232	br-j17	6	29	101412	Although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance . 
4233	br-j17	6	30	101450	The former comprise analeptic and psychoactive_drugs , the latter the tranquilizers . 
4234	br-j17	6	31	101462	Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging_to the same group as , for_instance , between reserpine and chlorpromazine . 
4235	br-j17	6	32	101484	Important as these differences are , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce depressions , whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and , eventually , maniclike changes . 
4236	br-j17	6	33	101530	The emotional_states produced by drugs influence the cortical_potentials in a characteristic manner ; synchrony prevails in the EEG of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizers , but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive_drugs . 
4237	br-j17	7	34	101566	The shock_therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance . 
4238	br-j17	7	35	101575	Physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges . 
4239	br-j17	7	36	101596	They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side . 
4240	br-j17	7	37	101606	This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock_therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl_test . 
4241	br-j17	7	38	101638	Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . 
4242	br-j17	7	39	101681	Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not_yet been tested on an adequate number of patients . 
4243	br-j17	7	40	101715	The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable . 
4244	br-j17	8	41	101765	It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep wakefulness cycle . 
4245	br-j17	8	42	101797	A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting . 
4246	br-j17	8	43	101827	In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such_as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs . 
4247	br-j17	8	44	101856	The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated . 
4248	br-j17	9	45	101878	Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies_in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity . 
4249	br-j17	9	46	101913	A state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not_only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli , but leads also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus acting sympathetically under control_conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response ! 
4250	br-j17	9	47	101966	Furthermore , conditioned_reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related_to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observed . 
4251	br-j17	9	48	102003	If , for_instance , such a change is produced by one or a_few insulin comas or electroshocks , previously inhibited conditioned_reactions reappear . 
4252	br-j17	9	49	102026	However , if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished . 
4253	br-j17	9	50	102043	In other studies , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned_reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes . 
4254	br-j17	10	51	102077	It has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ( 2 ) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned_reactions ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned_stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned_reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the EEG . 
4255	br-j17	10	52	102153	These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned_reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes . 
4256	br-j17	11	53	102197	The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion . 
4257	br-j17	11	54	102220	If this is the case , one would expect that not_only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional_state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise . 
4258	br-j17	11	55	102254	We pointed_out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic_disorders and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a battle neurosis . 
4259	br-j17	11	56	102297	This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may_not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses . 
4260	br-j17	11	57	102324	Being a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself . 
4261	br-j17	12	58	102348	Wolpe 's experiments and therapeutic work lie_in this area . 
4262	br-j17	12	59	102358	He showed convincingly that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned_)_reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed , therefore , that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible . 
4263	br-j17	12	60	102395	An important observation of Pavlov served as a guide_post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means . 
4264	br-j17	12	61	102413	In a conditioning experiment , he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain . 
4265	br-j17	12	62	102427	A mild electrical_shock served as a conditioned_stimulus and was followed by feeding . 
4266	br-j17	12	63	102440	The pain became thus the symbol for food and elicited salivary secretion ( conditioned_reflex ) . 
4267	br-j17	12	64	102456	Even when the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually , it failed to evoke any signs of pain . 
4268	br-j17	12	65	102476	Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding . 
4269	br-j17	12	66	102514	Appropriate experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible . 
4270	br-j17	12	67	102525	He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses . 
4271	br-j17	12	68	102537	He took advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established . 
4272	br-j17	13	69	102563	For the interpretation of these significant investigations , it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions which are closely associated with the emotions . 
4273	br-j17	13	70	102597	The feeding pain antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho - and ergotropic systems . 
4274	br-j17	13	71	102617	Furthermore , a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety . 
4275	br-j17	13	72	102633	Although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present , different autonomic somatic patterns underlie aggression and anxiety , respectively , as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines , the state of the muscle_tone , and the Mecholyl_test . 
4276	br-j17	13	73	102675	The psychological incompatibility of these emotional_states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference . 
4277	br-j17	14	74	102695	In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems , respectively . 
4278	br-j17	14	75	102740	We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic somatic downward discharge as_well_as regarding the hypothalamic cortical discharge . 
4279	br-j17	14	76	102763	Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic cortical discharges account_for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agents . 
4280	br-j17	14	77	102833	In_view_of the important role which emotional_disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes . 
4281	br-j18	1	1	102880	We are trying to study a linear_operator T on the finite dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct_sum of operators which are in some sense elementary . 
4282	br-j18	1	2	102910	We can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar_field F into a product of distinct monic_polynomials of degree 1 . 
4283	br-j18	1	3	102950	What can we do with the general T ? 
4284	br-j18	1	4	102959	If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . 
4285	br-j18	1	5	102976	First , T may not have a single characteristic value ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar_field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed . 
4286	br-j18	1	6	103005	Second , even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over F into a product of polynomials of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic vectors for T to span the space V ; this is clearly a deficiency in T . 
4287	br-j18	1	7	103048	The second situation is illustrated by the operator T on * * f ( F any field ) represented in the standard basis by * * f . 
4288	br-j18	1	8	103076	The characteristic polynomial for A is * * f and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for A ( or for T ) . 
4289	br-j18	1	9	103101	Thus T is not diagonalizable . 
4290	br-j18	1	10	103107	One sees that this happens because the null_space of * * f has dimension 1 only . 
4291	br-j18	1	11	103124	On_the_other_hand , the null_space of * * f and the null_space of * * f together span V , the former being the subspace spanned by * * f and the latter the subspace spanned by * * f and * * f . 
4292	br-j18	2	12	103168	This will be more_or_less our general method for the second problem . 
4293	br-j18	2	13	103180	If ( remember this is an assumption ) the minimal polynomial for T decomposes * * f where * * f are distinct elements of F , then we shall show that the space V is the direct_sum of the null_spaces of * * f . 
4294	br-j18	2	14	103226	The diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which * * f for each i . 
4295	br-j18	2	15	103244	The theorem which we prove is more general than what we have described , since it works with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial , whether or not the primes which enter are all of first degree . 
4296	br-j18	2	16	103283	The reader will find it helpful to think_of the special case when the primes are of degree 1 , and even more particularly , to think_of the proof of Theorem 10 , a special case of this theorem . 
4297	br-j18	3	17	103322	Let T be a linear_operator on the finite dimensional vector space V over the field F . 
4298	br-j18	3	18	103339	Let p be the minimal polynomial for T , * * f where the * * f are distinct irreducible monic_polynomials over F and the * * f are positive integers . 
4299	br-j18	3	19	103371	Let * * f be the null_space of * * f . 
4300	br-j18	3	20	103383	Then ( a ) * * f ( b ) each * * f is invariant under T ( c ) if * * f is the operator induced on * * f by T , then the minimal polynomial for * * f is * * f . 
4301	br-j18	4	21	103432	The idea of the proof is this . 
4302	br-j18	4	22	103440	If the direct_sum decomposition ( a ) is valid , how can we get hold of the projections * * f associated with the decomposition ? 
4303	br-j18	4	23	103466	The projection * * f will be the identity on * * f and zero on the other * * f . 
4304	br-j18	4	24	103488	We shall find a polynomial * * f such_that * * f is the identity on * * f and is zero on the other * * f , and so that * * f , etc. . 
4305	br-j18	5	25	103526	For each i , let * * f . 
4306	br-j18	5	26	103535	Since * * f are distinct prime polynomials , the polynomials * * f are relatively prime ( Theorem 8 , Chapter 4 ) . 
4307	br-j18	5	27	103560	Thus there are polynomials * * f such_that * * f . 
4308	br-j18	5	28	103572	Note also that if * * f , then * * f is divisible_by the polynomial p , because * * f contains each * * f as a factor . 
4309	br-j18	5	29	103603	We shall show that the polynomials * * f behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of the proof . 
4310	br-j18	6	30	103625	Let * * f . 
4311	br-j18	6	31	103630	Since * * f and p divides * * f for * * f , we have * * f . 
4312	br-j18	6	32	103651	Thus the * * f are projections which correspond to some direct_sum decomposition of the space V . 
4313	br-j18	6	33	103669	We wish to show that the range of * * f is exactly the subspace * * f . 
4314	br-j18	6	34	103688	It is clear that each vector in the range of * * f is in * * f for if |a is in the range of * * f , then * * f and so * * f because * * f is divisible_by the minimal polynomial p . 
4315	br-j18	6	35	103738	Conversely , suppose that |a is in the null_space of * * f . 
4316	br-j18	6	36	103752	If * * f , then * * f is divisible_by * * f and so * * f , i.e. , * * f . 
4317	br-j18	6	37	103778	But then it is immediate that * * f , i.e. , that |a is in the range of * * f . 
4318	br-j18	6	38	103801	This completes the proof of statement ( a ) . 
4319	br-j18	7	39	103811	It is certainly clear that the subspaces * * f are invariant under T . 
4320	br-j18	7	40	103826	If * * f is the operator induced on * * f by T , then evidently * * f , because by definition * * f is 0 on the subspace * * f . 
4321	br-j18	7	41	103862	This shows that the minimal polynomial for * * f divides * * f . 
4322	br-j18	7	42	103877	Conversely , let g be any polynomial such_that * * f . 
4323	br-j18	7	43	103889	Then * * f . 
4324	br-j18	7	44	103894	Thus * * f is divisible_by the minimal polynomial p of T , i.e. , * * f divides * * f . 
4325	br-j18	7	45	103917	It is easily seen that * * f divides g . 
4326	br-j18	7	46	103928	Hence the minimal polynomial for * * f is * * f . 
4327	br-j18	8	47	103941	If * * f are the projections associated with the primary decomposition of T , then each * * f is a polynomial in T , and accordingly if a linear_operator U commutes with T then U commutes with each of the * * f i.e. , each subspace * * f is invariant under U . 
4328	br-j18	9	48	103998	In the notation of the proof of Theorem 12 , let us take_a_look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for T is a product of first degree polynomials , i.e. , the case in which each * * f is of the form * * f . 
4329	br-j18	9	49	104048	Now the range of * * f is the null_space * * f of * * f . 
4330	br-j18	9	50	104066	Let us put * * f . 
4331	br-j18	9	51	104073	By Theorem 10 , D is a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of T . 
4332	br-j18	9	52	104092	Let us look_at the operator * * f . 
4333	br-j18	9	53	104101	Now * * f * * f so * * f . 
4334	br-j18	9	54	104113	The reader should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that * * f and in_general that * * f . 
4335	br-j18	9	55	104138	When * * f for each i , we shall have * * f , because the operator * * f will then be 0 on the range of * * f . 
4336	br-j18	10	56	104171	Let N be a linear_operator on the vector space V . 
4337	br-j18	10	57	104182	We say that N is nilpotent if there is some positive integer r such_that * * f . 
4338	br-j18	11	58	104200	Let T be a linear_operator on the finite dimensional vector space V over the field F . 
4339	br-j18	11	59	104217	Suppose that the minimal polynomial for T decomposes over F into a product of linear polynomials . 
4340	br-j18	11	60	104234	Then there is a diagonalizable operator D on V and a nilpotent operator N on V such_that ( a ) * * f , ( b ) * * f . 
4341	br-j18	11	61	104265	The diagonalizable operator D and the nilpotent operator N are uniquely determined by ( a ) and ( b ) and each of them is a polynomial in T . 
4342	br-j18	12	62	104295	We have just observed that we can write * * f where D is diagonalizable and N is nilpotent , and where D and N not_only commute but are polynomials in T . 
4343	br-j18	12	63	104328	Now suppose that we also have * * f where D ' is diagonalizable , N ' is nilpotent , and * * f . 
4344	br-j18	12	64	104353	We shall prove that * * f . 
4345	br-j18	13	65	104361	Since D ' and N ' commute with one another and * * f , we see that D ' and N ' commute with T . 
4346	br-j18	13	66	104388	Thus D ' and N ' commute with any polynomial in T ; hence they commute with D and with N . 
4347	br-j18	13	67	104410	Now we have * * f or * * f and all four of these operators commute with one another . 
4348	br-j18	13	68	104431	Since D and D ' are both diagonalizable and they commute , they are simultaneously diagonalizable , and * * f is diagonalizable . 
4349	br-j18	13	69	104455	Since N and N ' are both nilpotent and they commute , the operator * * f is nilpotent ; for , using the fact that N and N ' commute * * f and so when r is sufficiently large every term in this expression for * * f will be 0 . 
4350	br-j18	13	70	104509	( Actually , a nilpotent operator on an n-dimensional space must have its nth power 0 ; if we take * * f above , that will be large enough . 
4351	br-j18	13	71	104540	It then follows that * * f is large enough , but this is not obvious from the above expression . ) 
4352	br-j18	13	72	104562	Now * * f is a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent . 
4353	br-j18	13	73	104575	Such an operator is obviously the zero operator ; for since it is nilpotent , the minimal polynomial for this operator is of the form * * f for some * * f ; but then since the operator is diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; hence * * f and the minimal polynomial is simply x , which says the operator is 0 . 
4354	br-j18	13	74	104645	Thus we see that * * f and * * f . 
4355	br-j18	14	75	104657	Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field F , e.g. , the field of complex_numbers . 
4356	br-j18	14	76	104679	Then every linear_operator T on V can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator D and a nilpotent operator N which commute . 
4357	br-j18	14	77	104704	These operators D and N are unique and each is a polynomial in T . 
4358	br-j18	15	78	104719	From these results , one sees that the study of linear_operators on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators . 
4359	br-j18	15	79	104748	For vector spaces over non algebraically closed fields , we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and vectors . 
4360	br-j18	15	80	104770	It is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter . 
4361	br-j18	16	81	104796	In concluding this section , we should_like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem . 
4362	br-j18	16	82	104819	We have chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential_equations and thus is not purely linear_algebra . 
4363	br-j18	17	83	104843	In the primary decomposition theorem , it is not necessary that the vector space V be finite dimensional , nor is it necessary for parts ( a ) and ( b ) that p be the minimal polynomial for T . 
4364	br-j18	17	84	104884	If T is a linear_operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a monic_polynomial p such_that * * f , then parts ( a ) and ( b ) of Theorem 12 are valid for T with the proof which we gave . 
4365	br-j18	18	85	104929	Let n be a positive integer and let V be the space of all n times continuously differentiable functions f on the real line which satisfy the differential_equation * * f where * * f are some fixed constants . 
4366	br-j18	18	86	104969	If * * f denotes the space of n times continuously differentiable functions , then the space V of solutions of this differential_equation is a subspace of * * f . 
4367	br-j18	18	87	105000	If D denotes the differentiation operator and p is the polynomial * * f then V is the null_space of the operator p ( D ) , because * * f simply says * * f . 
4368	br-j18	18	88	105037	Let us now regard D as a linear_operator on the subspace V . 
4369	br-j18	18	89	105050	Then * * f . 
4370	br-j18	19	90	105055	If we are discussing differentiable complex valued functions , then * * f and V are complex vector spaces , and * * f may be any complex_numbers . 
4371	br-j18	19	91	105084	We now write * * f where * * f are distinct complex_numbers . 
4372	br-j18	19	92	105098	If * * f is the null_space of * * f , then Theorem 12 says that * * f . 
4373	br-j18	19	93	105119	In_other_words , if f satisfies the differential_equation * * f , then f is uniquely expressible in the form * * f where * * f satisfies the differential_equation * * f . 
4374	br-j18	19	94	105152	Thus , the study of the solutions to the equation * * f is reduced to the study of the space of solutions of a differential_equation of the form * * f . 
4375	br-j18	19	95	105185	This reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear_algebra , i.e. , by the primary decomposition theorem . 
4376	br-j18	20	96	105205	To describe the space of solutions to * * f , one must know something about differential_equations , that_is , one must know something about D other_than the fact that it is a linear_operator . 
4377	br-j18	20	97	105240	However , one does not need to know very_much . 
4378	br-j18	20	98	105250	It is very easy to establish by induction on r that if f is in * * f then * * f that_is , * * f , etc. . 
4379	br-j18	20	99	105280	Thus * * f if and only if * * f . 
4380	br-j18	20	100	105292	A function g such_that * * f , i.e. , * * f , must be a polynomial function of degree * * f or less : * * f . 
4381	br-j18	20	101	105323	Thus f satisfies * * f if and only if f has the form * * f . 
4382	br-j18	20	102	105341	Accordingly , the ' functions ' * * f span the space of solutions of * * f . 
4383	br-j18	20	103	105360	Since * * f are linearly independent functions and the exponential_function has no zeros , these r functions * * f , form a basis for the space of solutions . 
4384	br-j19	1	1	105391	Some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes . 
4385	br-j19	1	2	105407	The binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another . 
4386	br-j19	1	3	105430	We devote a chapter to the binomial_distribution not_only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real_life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models . 
4387	br-j19	1	4	105467	We begin with a_few examples of binomial experiments . 
4388	br-j19	2	5	105476	A trained marksman shooting five rounds at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times . 
4389	br-j19	2	6	105503	In repeated sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary . 
4390	br-j19	2	7	105515	What can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes ? 
4391	br-j19	3	8	105530	In litters of eight mice from similar parents , the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer from 0 to 8 . 
4392	br-j19	3	9	105557	What probabilities should be attached to these possible outcomes ? 
4393	br-j19	4	10	105567	When three dice are tossed repeatedly , what is the probability that the number of aces is 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 ) ? 
4394	br-j19	5	11	105596	More generally , suppose that an experiment consists_of a number of independent trials , that each trial results in either a `` success '' or a `` non success '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial . 
4395	br-j19	5	12	105645	In the examples above , the occurrence of a bull's-eye , a straight haired mouse , or an ace could be called a `` success '' . 
4396	br-j19	5	13	105672	In_general , any outcome we choose may be labeled `` success '' . 
4397	br-j19	6	14	105685	The major question in this chapter is : What is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials ? 
4398	br-j19	7	15	105705	In Chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples , usually by counting points in a sample space . 
4399	br-j19	7	16	105728	Fortunately , a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind . 
4400	br-j19	7	17	105743	Before deriving this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' . 
4401	br-j19	8	18	105761	Experiments are often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated . 
4402	br-j19	8	19	105777	In the marksmanship example , a trial consists_of `` one round shot at a target '' with outcome either one bull's-eye ( success ) or none ( failure ) . 
4403	br-j19	8	20	105807	Further , an experiment might consist_of five rounds , and several sets of five rounds might be regarded_as a super experiment composed of several repetitions of the five round experiment . 
4404	br-j19	8	21	105838	If three dice are tossed , a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials . 
4405	br-j19	8	22	105861	Or , what amounts to the same thing , if one die is tossed three times , each toss is a trial , and the three tosses form the experiment . 
4406	br-j19	8	23	105892	Mathematically , we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times . 
4407	br-j19	8	24	105914	These examples are illustrative of the use of the words `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are used in this chapter , but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly . 
4408	br-j19	9	25	105956	Ten students act_as managers for a high-school football_team , and of these managers a proportion p are licensed drivers . 
4409	br-j19	9	26	105976	Each Friday one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck . 
4410	br-j19	9	27	105995	On three Fridays the coach has needed a driver . 
4411	br-j19	9	28	106005	Considering only these Fridays , what is the probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times ? 
4412	br-j19	9	29	106023	Exactly 2 times ? 
4413	br-j19	9	30	106027	1 time ? 
4414	br-j19	9	31	106030	0 time ? 
4415	br-j19	10	32	106033	Note that there are 3 trials of interest . 
4416	br-j19	10	33	106042	Each trial consists_of choosing a student manager at_random . 
4417	br-j19	10	34	106051	The 2 possible outcomes on each trial are `` driver '' or `` nondriver '' . 
4418	br-j19	10	35	106067	Since the choice is by lot each_week , the outcomes of different trials are independent . 
4419	br-j19	10	36	106083	The managers stay the same , so that * * f is the same for all weeks . 
4420	br-j19	10	37	106101	We now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments . 
4421	br-j19	11	38	106111	For an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment , it must have four properties : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number of trials , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trials must have identical probabilities of success , ( 4 ) the trials must be independent of each other . 
4422	br-j19	11	39	106186	Below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties . 
4423	br-j19	11	40	106200	We also give , for each property , an example where the property is absent . 
4424	br-j19	11	41	106216	The language and notation introduced are standard throughout the chapter . 
4425	br-j19	12	42	106227	For the marksman , we study sets of five shots ( * * f ) ; for the mice , we restrict attention to litters of eight ( * * f ) ; and for the aces , we toss three dice ( * * f ) . 
4426	br-j19	13	43	106275	Toss a die until an ace appears . 
4427	br-j19	13	44	106283	Here the number of trials is a random_variable , not a fixed number . 
4428	br-j19	14	45	106297	Each of the n trials is either a success or a failure . 
4429	br-j19	14	46	106310	`` Success '' and `` failure '' are just convenient labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk_about binomial trials in_general . 
4430	br-j19	14	47	106334	These words are more expressive than labels like `` A '' and `` not - A '' . 
4431	br-j19	14	48	106352	It is natural from the marksman 's viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success , but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse . 
4432	br-j19	14	49	106385	The word `` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two terms '' , and both usages apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial , and the second to the terms p and * * f that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure '' . 
4433	br-j19	14	50	106449	Sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes `` ace '' and `` not ace '' . 
4434	br-j19	15	51	106492	We classify mice as `` straight haired '' or `` wavy haired '' , but a hairless mouse appears . 
4435	br-j19	15	52	106512	We can escape_from such a difficulty by ruling_out the animal as not constituting a trial , but such a solution is not always satisfactory . 
4436	br-j19	16	53	106537	Each die has probability * * f of producing an ace ; the marksman has some probability p , perhaps 0.1 , of making a bull's-eye . 
4437	br-j19	16	54	106564	Note that we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial . 
4438	br-j19	17	55	106582	During a round of target_practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles the marksman , lowering his chance of a bull's-eye . 
4439	br-j19	18	56	106606	Strictly_speaking , this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials . 
4440	br-j19	18	57	106638	Thus in the three dice example * * f , * * f , and the independence assumption implies that the probability that the three dice fall ace , not ace , ace in that order is ( 1 6 ) ( 5 6 ) ( 1 6 ) . 
4441	br-j19	18	58	106688	Experimentally , we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another . 
4442	br-j19	19	59	106704	A family of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains , and a coin is tossed to decide . 
4443	br-j19	19	60	106729	We want to know the number of people going_to the mountains . 
4444	br-j19	19	61	106741	When this experiment is viewed_as composed of five binomial trials , one for each member of the family , the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent . 
4445	br-j19	19	62	106770	Indeed , the experiment is better viewed_as consisting_of one binomial trial for the entire family . 
4446	br-j19	19	63	106786	The following is a less extreme example of dependence . 
4447	br-j19	19	64	106796	Consider couples visiting an art museum . 
4448	br-j19	19	65	106803	Each person votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular prize . 
4449	br-j19	19	66	106819	Voting for one picture may be called `` success '' , for the other `` failure '' . 
4450	br-j19	19	67	106837	An experiment consists_of the voting of one couple , or two trials . 
4451	br-j19	19	68	106850	In repetitions of the experiment from couple to couple , the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply , because couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors . 
4452	br-j19	19	69	106907	Table 7 - 1 illustrates the point . 
4453	br-j19	19	70	106915	The table shows that 0.6 of the boys and 0.6 of the girls vote for picture A . 
4454	br-j19	19	71	106933	Therefore , under independent voting , * * f or 0.36 of the couples would cast two votes for picture A , and * * f or 0.16 would cast two votes for picture B . 
4455	br-j19	19	72	106969	Thus in independent voting , * * f or 0.52 of the couples would agree . 
4456	br-j19	19	73	106985	But Table 7 - 1 shows that * * f or 0.70 agree , too many for independent voting . 
4457	br-j19	20	74	107005	Each performance of an n-trial binomial experiment results in some whole_number from 0 through n as the value of the random_variable X , where * * f . 
4458	br-j19	20	75	107033	We want to study the probability function of this random_variable . 
4459	br-j19	20	76	107044	For_example , we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes , not which shots were bull's-eyes . 
4460	br-j19	20	77	107061	A binomial experiment can produce random_variables other_than the number of successes . 
4461	br-j19	20	78	107073	For_example , the marksman gets 5 shots , but we take his score to be the number of shots before his first bull's-eye , that_is , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( or 5 , if he gets no bull's-eye ) . 
4462	br-j19	20	79	107119	Thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes , and the random_variable is not the number of successes . 
4463	br-j19	21	80	107139	The constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in_practice . 
4464	br-j19	21	81	107156	Obviously , very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference . 
4465	br-j19	21	82	107183	( For_instance , see Example 2 of Section 5 - 5 , on red cards in hands of 5 . ) 
4466	br-j19	21	83	107204	On_the_other_hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical_phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes ; that_is , we may discuss the phenomenon in_terms_of its departures from the binomial model . 
4467	br-j19	22	84	107249	A binomial experiment consists_of * * f independent binomial trials , all with the same probability * * f of yielding a success . 
4468	br-j19	22	85	107273	The outcome of the experiment is X successes . 
4469	br-j19	22	86	107282	The random_variable X takes the values * * f with probabilities * * f or , more briefly * * f . 
4470	br-j19	23	87	107304	We shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x successes for given values of p and n . 
4471	br-j19	23	88	107324	When each number of successes x is paired with its probability of occurrence * * f , the set of pairs * * f , is a probability function called a binomial_distribution . 
4472	br-j19	23	89	107357	The choice of p and n determines the binomial_distribution uniquely , and different choices always produce different distributions ( except when * * f ; then the number of successes is always 0 ) . 
4473	br-j19	23	90	107392	The set of all binomial_distributions is called the family of binomial_distributions , but in general discussions this expression is often shortened to `` the binomial_distribution '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context is clear . 
4474	br-j19	23	91	107431	Binomial_distributions were treated by James_Bernoulli about 1700 , and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called Bernoulli trials . 
4475	br-j19	24	92	107451	Each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success . 
4476	br-j19	24	93	107465	Therefore each binomial trial can be thought_of as producing a value of a random_variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 , with probabilities q and p respectively . 
4477	br-j19	24	94	107498	The several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random_variable X , the total number of successes , which is just the sum of the random_variables associated with the single trials . 
4478	br-j19	25	95	107531	The marksman gets two bull's-eyes , one on his third shot and one on his fifth . 
4479	br-j19	25	96	107548	The numbers of successes on the five individual shots are , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 . 
4480	br-j19	25	97	107571	The number of successes on each shot is a value of a random_variable that has values 0 or 1 , and there are 5 such random_variables here . 
4481	br-j19	25	98	107599	Their sum is X , the total number of successes , which in this experiment has the value * * f . 
4482	br-j20	1	1	107621	Consider a simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by **f . 
4483	br-j20	1	2	107648	These are real analytic periodic functions with period T . 
4484	br-j20	1	3	107658	In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares . 
4485	br-j20	1	4	107696	This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in **f . 
4486	br-j20	1	5	107721	The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in **f there are families of such cubes . 
4487	br-j20	1	6	107746	Here , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results . 
4488	br-j20	2	7	107770	A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may_not lie entirely in the interior of C . 
4489	br-j20	2	8	107800	Indeed , the spiral **f , with the two endpoints connected by a straight_line possesses only one inscribed square . 
4490	br-j20	2	9	107820	The square has one corner point on the straight_line segment , and does not lie entirely in the interior . 
4491	br-j20	3	10	107840	On C , from the point P at **f to the point Q at **f , we construct the chord , and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as s approaches zero the square is inside C . 
4492	br-j20	3	11	107886	As s increases we consider the two free corner points of the square , **f and **f , adjacent to P and Q respectively . 
4493	br-j20	3	12	107911	As s approaches T the square will be outside C and therefore both **f and **f must cross C an odd number of times as s varies from zero to T . 
4494	br-j20	3	13	107943	The points may also touch C without crossing . 
4495	br-j20	4	14	107952	Suppose **f crosses C when **f . 
4496	br-j20	4	15	107959	We now have certain squares with three corners on C . 
4497	br-j20	4	16	107970	For any such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the diagonal point of the square . 
4498	br-j20	4	17	108004	Each point on C , as a vertex , may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal points by the above construction . 
4499	br-j20	5	18	108027	To each paired vertex and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point , i.e. , the corner on C reached first by proceeding along C from the vertex in the direction of increasing t . 
4500	br-j20	5	19	108064	If the vertex is at **f , and if the interior of C is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating C clockwise through 90 ` about the vertex . 
4501	br-j20	5	20	108113	The set of intersections of **f , the rotated curve , with the original curve C consists_of just the set of forward corner points on C corresponding to the vertex at **f , plus the vertex itself . 
4502	br-j20	5	21	108151	We note that two such curves C and **f , cannot coincide at more_than a finite number of points ; otherwise , being analytic , they would coincide at all points , which is impossible since they do not coincide near **f . 
4503	br-j20	6	22	108194	With each vertex we associate certain numerical values , namely the set of positive differences in the parameter t between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points . 
4504	br-j20	6	23	108223	For the vertex at **f , these values will be denoted by **f . 
4505	br-j20	6	24	108237	The function f ( t ) defined in this way is multi valued . 
4506	br-j20	7	25	108251	We consider now the graph of the function f ( t ) on **f . 
4507	br-j20	7	26	108266	We will refer to the plane of C and **f as the C-plane and to the plane of the graph as the f-plane . 
4508	br-j20	7	27	108290	The graph , as a set , may have a finite number of components . 
4509	br-j20	7	28	108305	We will denote the values of f ( t ) on different components by **f . 
4510	br-j20	7	29	108321	Each point with abscissa t on the graph represents an intersection between C and **f . 
4511	br-j20	7	30	108337	There are two types of such intersections , depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point_of_intersection . 
4512	br-j20	7	31	108356	An ordinary point will be any point_of_intersection A such_that in every neighborhood of A in the C-plane , **f meets both the interior and the exterior of C . 
4513	br-j20	7	32	108385	Any other point_of_intersection between C and **f will be called a tangent point . 
4514	br-j20	7	33	108399	This terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the f-plane . 
4515	br-j20	7	34	108413	We can now prove several lemmas . 
4516	br-j20	8	35	108420	In some neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph , the function f is a single valued , continuous function . 
4517	br-j20	9	36	108445	We first show that the function is single valued in some neighborhood . 
4518	br-j20	9	37	108458	With the vertex at **f in the C-plane we assume that **f is the parametric location on C of an ordinary intersection Q between C and **f . 
4519	br-j20	9	38	108486	In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are **f . 
4520	br-j20	9	39	108498	We know that in the C-plane both C and **f are analytic . 
4521	br-j20	9	40	108511	In the C-plane we construct a set of rectangular Cartesian coordinates u , v with the origin at Q and such_that both C and **f have finite slope at Q . 
4522	br-j20	9	41	108542	Near Q , both curves can be represented by analytic functions of u . 
4523	br-j20	9	42	108556	In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single valued , analytic function of u . 
4524	br-j20	9	43	108577	Furthermore , one can find a neighborhood of Q in which the difference function is monotone , for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number of extrema in any interval . 
4525	br-j20	9	44	108612	Now , to find **f , one needs the intersection of C and **f near Q . 
4526	br-j20	9	45	108629	But **f is just the curve **f translated without rotation through a small arc , for **f is always obtained by rotating C through exactly 90 ` . 
4527	br-j20	9	46	108657	The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve . 
4528	br-j20	9	47	108668	Thus if e is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of C and **f near Q , for if there were more than one intersection for every e then the difference between C and **f near Q would not be a monotone function . 
4529	br-j20	9	48	108715	Therefore , **f is single valued near Q . 
4530	br-j20	9	49	108724	It is also seen that **f , since the change from **f to **f is accomplished by a continuous translation . 
4531	br-j20	9	50	108745	Thus **f is also continuous at **f , and in a neighborhood of **f which does not contain a tangent point . 
4532	br-j20	10	51	108767	We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph . 
4533	br-j20	10	52	108780	This set must consist_of isolated points and closed_intervals . 
4534	br-j20	10	53	108789	The fact that there can not be any limit_points of the set except in closed_intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and **f are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point . 
4535	br-j20	10	54	108853	This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points . 
4536	br-j20	11	55	108866	In some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane , say **f , the function **f is either double valued or has no values defined , except at the tangent point itself , where it is single valued . 
4537	br-j20	12	56	108907	A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and **f are tangent to one another . 
4538	br-j20	12	57	108925	A continuous change in t through an amount e results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve **f . 
4539	br-j20	12	58	108947	There are three possibilities : ( a ) **f remains tangent to C as it is translated ; ( b ) **f moves away from C and does not intersect it at_all for **f ; ( c ) **f cuts_across C and there are two ordinary intersections for every t in **f . 
4540	br-j20	12	59	109000	The first possibility results in a closed_interval of tangent points in the f-plane , the end_points of which fall_into category ( b ) or ( c ) . 
4541	br-j20	12	60	109028	In the second category the function **f has no values defined in a neighborhood **f . 
4542	br-j20	12	61	109044	In the third category the function is double valued in this interval . 
4543	br-j20	12	62	109057	The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of **f . 
4544	br-j20	12	63	109071	Again , the analyticity of the two curves guarantee that such intervals exist . 
4545	br-j20	12	64	109085	In the neighborhood of an end_point of an interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two valued or no valued on one side , and is a single valued function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side . 
4546	br-j20	13	65	109128	With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of f . 
4547	br-j20	13	66	109144	First , for any value of t for which all values of f ( t ) are ordinary points the number of values of f ( t ) must be odd . 
4548	br-j20	13	67	109176	For it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of C and **f must be even ( otherwise , starting in the interior of C , **f could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of rotation at t is the argument of the function , not a value . 
4549	br-j20	13	68	109232	Therefore , for any value of t the number of values of f ( t ) is equal to the ( finite ) number of tangent points corresponding to the argument t plus an odd number . 
4550	br-j20	14	69	109269	The number of ordinary values of the function f ( t ) at t will be called its multiplicity at t . 
4551	br-j20	15	70	109291	The graph of f has at_least one component whose support is the entire interval [ 0 , T ] . 
4552	br-j20	16	71	109311	We suppose not . 
4553	br-j20	16	72	109315	Then every component of the graph of f must be defined over a bounded sub-interval . 
4554	br-j20	16	73	109331	Suppose **f is defined in the sub-interval **f . 
4555	br-j20	16	74	109340	Now **f and **f must both be tangent points on the nth component in the f-plane ; otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points . 
4556	br-j20	16	75	109369	Further , we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of f can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even integer . 
4557	br-j20	16	76	109402	Thus the multiplicity of **f for a given t must be an even number . 
4558	br-j20	16	77	109417	This is true of all components which have such a bounded support . 
4559	br-j20	16	78	109430	But this is a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f ( t ) is odd for every t . 
4560	br-j20	17	79	109453	We have shown that the graph of f contains at_least one component whose inverse is the entire interval [ 0 , T ] , and whose multiplicity is odd . 
4561	br-j20	17	80	109483	There must be an odd number of such components , which will be called complete components . 
4562	br-j20	17	81	109500	The remaining ( incomplete ) components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument , and are defined only on a proper sub-interval of [ 0 , T ] . 
4563	br-j20	18	82	109533	We must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the C-plane are on opposite sides of C . 
4564	br-j20	18	83	109564	We again consider a fixed point P at **f and a variable point Q at **f on C . 
4565	br-j20	18	84	109583	We erect a square with PQ as a side and with free corners **f and **f adjacent to P and Q respectively . 
4566	br-j20	18	85	109606	As s varies from zero to T , the values of s for which **f and **f cross C will be denoted by **f and **f respectively . 
4567	br-j20	18	86	109634	We have **f , plus tangent points . 
4568	br-j20	18	87	109642	These s-values are just the ordinary values of **f . 
4569	br-j20	19	88	109652	The values **f are the ordinary values at **f of a multi valued function g ( t ) which has components corresponding to those of f ( t ) . 
4570	br-j20	20	89	109682	We first define a function b ( t ) as_follows : given the set of squares such_that each has three corners on C and vertex at t , b ( t ) is the corresponding set of positive parametric differences between t and the backward corner points . 
4571	br-j20	20	90	109730	The functions f and b have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument t . 
4572	br-j20	20	91	109745	Now with P fixed at **f , **f-values occur when the corner **f crosses C , and are among the values of s such_that **f . 
4573	br-j20	20	92	109771	The roots of this equation are just the ordinates of the intersections of the graph of b with a straight_line of unit slope through **f in the b-plane ( the plane of the graph of b ) . 
4574	br-j20	20	93	109809	We define these values as **f , and define g ( t ) in the same way for each t . 
4575	br-j20	20	94	109830	Thus we obtain g ( t ) by introducing an oblique g ( t ) - axis in the b-plane . 
4576	br-j22	1	1	109851	These societies can expect to face difficult times . 
4577	br-j22	1	2	109860	As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense_of_direction . 
4578	br-j22	1	3	109916	National_leaders will have_to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men 's sense of identity . 
4579	br-j22	1	4	109943	Feelings of a community of interest will have_to be recreated - in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for_the_first_time - on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past . 
4580	br-j22	1	5	109990	Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing_through this stage can be escaped . 
4581	br-j22	1	6	110021	The United_States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible . 
4582	br-j22	2	7	110051	Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face . 
4583	br-j22	2	8	110074	At_the_same_time , we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts . 
4584	br-j22	2	9	110109	It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing_up to the intractable tasks at_home . 
4585	br-j22	2	10	110142	We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene . 
4586	br-j22	2	11	110173	When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold_war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not_only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development . 
4587	br-j22	2	12	110219	As a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community . 
4588	br-j22	3	13	110258	When we look_at countries like Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , and Burma , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern_men and of social overhead capital , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy . 
4589	br-j22	3	14	110319	The men in power are committed in_principle to modernization , but economic and social changes are proceeding only erratically . 
4590	br-j22	3	15	110339	Isolated enterprises have been launched , but they are not_yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern . 
4591	br-j22	3	16	110358	The society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector , with very poor communications between the two . 
4592	br-j22	3	17	110387	Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted . 
4593	br-j22	4	18	110431	Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social_system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective . 
4594	br-j22	4	19	110464	In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals . 
4595	br-j22	4	20	110484	The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them - and that with independence free_men do not have_to work to realize the benefits of modern life . 
4596	br-j22	4	21	110525	For_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement . 
4597	br-j22	4	22	110571	The civil_services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . 
4598	br-j22	5	23	110609	American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies . 
4599	br-j22	5	24	110643	We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call_for effort as_well_as enthusiasm . 
4600	br-j22	5	25	110662	Above_all , we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible_for their fates . 
4601	br-j22	5	26	110686	Only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance . 
4602	br-j22	5	27	110706	With_respect_to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions , we can afford to wait , for in_time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see . 
4603	br-j22	6	28	110739	Our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments . 
4604	br-j22	6	29	110777	We should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and provincial governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected . 
4605	br-j22	6	30	110816	Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above_all , how progress in each field relates to national progress . 
4606	br-j22	6	31	110870	Efforts such_as the Community_Development_Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development . 
4607	br-j22	6	32	110889	To achieve this goal of balanced development , communications between the central government and the local communities must be such_that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken_into_account . 
4608	br-j22	6	33	110921	If modernization programs are imposed from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulties . 
4609	br-j22	7	34	110944	Land_reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries . 
4610	br-j22	7	35	110958	It should be American policy not_only to encourage effective land_reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society . 
4611	br-j22	7	36	110988	As an isolated policy , land_reform is likely to be politically disruptive ; as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance . 
4612	br-j22	7	37	111017	It should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone . 
4613	br-j22	7	38	111036	Land_reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture . 
4614	br-j22	8	39	111054	Lastly , governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead . 
4615	br-j22	8	40	111073	By holding_out prospects for external capital assistance , the United_States can provide strong incentives to prepare_for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth . 
4616	br-j22	9	41	111099	At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , Brazil , the Philippines , and Taiwan , which are ready and committed to move_into the stage of self-sustaining growth . 
4617	br-j22	9	42	111134	They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups . 
4618	br-j22	9	43	111172	But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies . 
4619	br-j22	10	44	111226	On the economic front , the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources . 
4620	br-j22	10	45	111247	Several related tasks must be carried_out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved . 
4621	br-j22	10	46	111261	These countries must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy . 
4622	br-j22	10	47	111285	They must in their planning be able to count_on at_least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years . 
4623	br-j22	10	48	111307	Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go_forward . 
4624	br-j22	10	49	111330	Capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning . 
4625	br-j22	10	50	111341	Finally , a balance must be effected among project finance , utilization of agricultural surpluses , and general balance_of_payments support . 
4626	br-j22	11	51	111362	Thus , although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many_of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of American economic_policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign_exchange . 
4627	br-j22	12	52	111423	There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved . 
4628	br-j22	12	53	111434	For_one_thing , although considerable numbers of men have been trained , bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects ; even the famed Indian_Civil_Service is not fully adequate_to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken . 
4629	br-j22	12	54	111470	Technical assistance in training middle - and upper-level management_personnel is still needed in many cases . 
4630	br-j22	12	55	111486	There are also more basic problems . 
4631	br-j22	12	56	111493	This is the stage at which democratic developments must take_place if the society is to become an open community of creative people . 
4632	br-j22	12	57	111516	Nevertheless , impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practices . 
4633	br-j22	12	58	111539	Another great danger is that the emerging middle_class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political_leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism . 
4634	br-j22	12	59	111574	The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West . 
4635	br-j22	12	60	111618	Particularly when based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest . 
4636	br-j22	12	61	111645	Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead rigid and inflexible in their policies . 
4637	br-j22	13	62	111691	American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes . 
4638	br-j22	13	63	111708	It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies . 
4639	br-j22	13	64	111735	We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways . 
4640	br-j22	14	65	111781	We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period_of_time . 
4641	br-j22	14	66	111797	With the exception of treaty making , foreign relations were historically concerned for_the_most_part with conditions of short or at_least measurable duration . 
4642	br-j22	14	67	111819	Foreign_policy now takes_on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection . 
4643	br-j22	14	68	111838	American and free-world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition ; but basically that pace depends_on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes , political institutions , and social_structure which each society must generate . 
4644	br-j22	14	69	111878	It follows that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working horizon . 
4645	br-j22	14	70	111896	It must be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its trademark . 
4646	br-j22	15	71	111913	This condition affects not_only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign_policy , especially in the context of economic aid . 
4647	br-j23	1	1	111937	The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; as a complex it fits into the whole social_organization and functions dominantly in every part of_it . 
4648	br-j23	1	2	111968	In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . 
4649	br-j23	1	3	111984	With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences_of_opinion as to the essential features of religion ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . 
4650	br-j23	1	4	112015	Nevertheless , for most_of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions . 
4651	br-j23	2	5	112044	Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social_organization , they have important indirect consequences . 
4652	br-j23	2	6	112064	If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows . 
4653	br-j23	2	7	112113	There are several closely related inner functions . 
4654	br-j23	3	8	112121	In_the_last_analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man 's deepest experience - the religious . 
4655	br-j23	3	9	112148	Man is first religious ; the instrumentalities follow . 
4656	br-j23	3	10	112157	Religion seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence . 
4657	br-j23	3	11	112167	The significant things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation , self pacification , and self completion . 
4658	br-j23	3	12	112205	The chief experience is the sensing of communion , and in the higher religions , of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power . 
4659	br-j23	3	13	112229	Related_to this is the fact that most_of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered , dependable universe . 
4660	br-j23	3	14	112265	Man has the experience of being helpfully allied_with what he cannot fully understand ; he is a coordinate part of all_of the mysterious energy and being and movement . 
4661	br-j23	3	15	112294	The universe is a safe and permanent home . 
4662	br-j23	4	16	112303	A number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal . 
4663	br-j23	4	17	112322	Death is not permanent defeat and disappearance ; man has a second chance . 
4664	br-j23	4	18	112336	He is not lost in the abyss of endless time ; he has endless being . 
4665	br-j23	4	19	112352	Religion at its best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm of the spirit . 
4666	br-j23	4	20	112374	Religion can summate , epitomize , relate , and conserve all the highest ideals and values - ethical , aesthetic , and religious - of man formed in his culture . 
4667	br-j23	5	21	112405	There is also the possibility , among higher religions , of experiencing consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and expansiveness . 
4668	br-j23	5	22	112427	The kind of religious experience that most moderns seek not_only provides , clarifies , and relates human yearnings , values , ideals , and purposes ; it also provides facilities and incitements for the development of personality , sociality , and creativeness . 
4669	br-j23	5	23	112470	Under the religious impulse , whether theistic or humanistic , men have joy in living ; life leads somewhere . 
4670	br-j23	5	24	112490	Religion at its best is out in_front , ever beckoning and leading_on , and , as Lippman put it , `` mobilizing all man 's scattered energies in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance '' . 
4671	br-j23	6	25	112528	At_the_same_time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also has great therapeutic value for him . 
4672	br-j23	6	26	112559	It gives him aid , comfort , even solace , in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate . 
4673	br-j23	6	27	112590	He is confronted with the recurrent crises , such_as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life - marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old_age , the certainty of death . 
4674	br-j23	6	28	112623	He has_to cope_with frustration and other emotional_disturbance and anomie . 
4675	br-j23	6	29	112633	His religious_beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern , and his religious faith makes possible fortitude , equanimity , and consolation , enabling him to endure colossal misfortune , fear , frustration , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger . 
4676	br-j23	6	30	112682	Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state . 
4677	br-j23	7	31	112699	The belief in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here_and_now . 
4678	br-j23	7	32	112720	The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . 
4679	br-j23	7	33	112750	The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as_well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving_vent to emotions and energies . 
4680	br-j23	8	34	112813	In providing for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace_of_mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution . 
4681	br-j23	9	35	112839	In_addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society . 
4682	br-j23	9	36	112862	The two have never been separable . 
4683	br-j23	9	37	112869	Religion is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation . 
4684	br-j23	10	38	112880	The value-system of a community or society is always correlated with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more_or_less shared system of religious_beliefs and convictions . 
4685	br-j23	10	39	112908	The religion supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values . 
4686	br-j23	10	40	112922	Even in the united_states , with its freedom of religious_belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values . 
4687	br-j23	10	41	112951	This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value_orientation elsewhere ; for_example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism . 
4688	br-j23	10	42	112977	In America also all_of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion . 
4689	br-j23	10	43	112998	Even the non church_members - the freewheelers , marginal religionists and_so_on - have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them . 
4690	br-j23	10	44	113020	Furthermore , religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; for_example , those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends . 
4691	br-j23	10	45	113056	Finally , it gives sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; for_example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument . 
4692	br-j23	10	46	113103	It places certain values at_least beyond questioning and tampering . 
4693	br-j23	11	47	113113	Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends . 
4694	br-j23	11	48	113144	This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning interpretable in_terms_of ultimate ends ; for_example , a plan that fulfills the will of God , which advances the Kingdom_of_God , which involves social life as part of the Grand Design . 
4695	br-j23	11	49	113190	This explains some group ends and provides a justification of their primacy . 
4696	br-j23	11	50	113203	It gives social guidance and direction and makes_for programs of social action . 
4697	br-j23	11	51	113216	Finally , it gives meaning to much social endeavor , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life . 
4698	br-j23	11	52	113236	In_general , there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends . 
4699	br-j23	12	53	113254	Religion integrates and unifies . 
4700	br-j23	12	54	113259	Some of the oldest , most persistent , and most cohesive forms of social groupings have grown out of religion . 
4701	br-j23	12	55	113280	These groups have varied widely from mere families , primitive , totemic groups , and small modern cults and sects , to the memberships of great denominations , and great , widely dispersed world religions . 
4702	br-j23	12	56	113316	Religion fosters group life in various ways . 
4703	br-j23	12	57	113324	The common ultimate values , ends and goals fostered by religion are a most important factor . 
4704	br-j23	12	58	113341	Without a system of values there can be no society . 
4705	br-j23	12	59	113352	Where such a value_system prevails , it always unifies all who possess it ; it enables members of the society to operate as a system . 
4706	br-j23	12	60	113378	The beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in creeds , dogmas , and doctrines , and form what Durkheim calls a credo . 
4707	br-j23	12	61	113405	As he points_out , a religious group cannot exist without a collective credo , and the more extensive the credo , the more unified and strong is the group . 
4708	br-j23	12	62	113435	The credo unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the firmer the group . 
4709	br-j23	13	63	113467	The religious symbolism , and especially the closely related rites and worship forms , constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith . 
4710	br-j23	13	64	113493	The religion , in_fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large . 
4711	br-j23	13	65	113512	The common codes , for religious action as_such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotees together . 
4712	br-j23	13	66	113535	These are ways of jointly participating in significantly symbolized , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior . 
4713	br-j23	13	67	113553	The codes are mechanism for training in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group . 
4714	br-j23	14	68	113582	Durkheim noted long_ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things - unite [ s ] into one single moral community - all those who adhere to them '' . 
4715	br-j23	14	69	113619	His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit . 
4716	br-j23	14	70	113644	This is brought_out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United_States ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds . 
4717	br-j23	15	71	113696	The unifying effect of religion is also brought_out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more_or_less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized . 
4718	br-j23	15	72	113735	The Jews for 2500 years have been a prime example , though the adherents of any world or inter people religion are cases_in_point . 
4719	br-j23	15	73	113759	it might be pointed_out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic . 
4720	br-j23	16	74	113800	Religion usually exercises a stabilizing conserving function . 
4721	br-j23	16	75	113808	As_such it acts_as an anchor for the people . 
4722	br-j23	16	76	113817	There is a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not_only in their own doctrines and policies and practices , but also in secular affairs having religious relevance . 
4723	br-j23	16	77	113852	It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones . 
4724	br-j23	16	78	113883	It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living . 
4725	br-j23	16	79	113905	As Yinger has pointed_out , the `` reliance on symbols , on tradition , on sacred_writings , on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future '' . 
4726	br-j23	16	80	113949	Historically , religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institutions . 
4727	br-j23	17	81	113973	At_the_same_time that religion exercises a conserving influence , it also energizes and motivates both individuals and groups . 
4728	br-j23	17	82	113991	Much of the important individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives . 
4729	br-j23	17	83	114006	The great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon_lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force , mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices ; for_example , the Crusades , mission efforts , just wars . 
4730	br-j23	17	84	114045	Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion . 
4731	br-j23	17	85	114063	The insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects . 
4732	br-j23	17	86	114076	Religion provides the most attractive rewards , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely abide_by its norms , but who engage in good works . 
4733	br-j23	18	87	114107	Religion usually acts_as a powerful aid in social_control , enforcing what men should or should not do . 
4734	br-j23	18	88	114125	Among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group ; and in modern societies such influence is still great . 
4735	br-j23	18	89	114158	Religion has its own supernatural prescriptions that are at_the_same_time codes_of_behavior for the here_and_now . 
4736	br-j37	1	1	114172	An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts . 
4737	br-j37	1	2	114183	First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . 
4738	br-j37	1	3	114199	Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first_steps to organize rural communes . 
4739	br-j37	1	4	114216	All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination . 
4740	br-j37	1	5	114241	The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . 
4741	br-j37	1	6	114259	Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach . 
4742	br-j37	1	7	114275	However , the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances . 
4743	br-j37	1	8	114304	A third aspect , and probably the one open_to most controversy , is the results of the election . 
4744	br-j37	1	9	114323	The electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections . 
4745	br-j37	1	10	114363	The fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . 
4746	br-j37	2	11	114390	Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence . 
4747	br-j37	2	12	114405	They were stressed in the speeches of Si_Mubarak_Bekkai when the first Council_of_Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council . 
4748	br-j37	2	13	114433	King_Muhammad /5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections on May_Day , 1957 . 
4749	br-j37	2	14	114461	There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister_of_the_Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less_than enthusiastic . 
4750	br-j37	2	15	114501	Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the_French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious . 
4751	br-j37	3	16	114533	From the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government . 
4752	br-j37	3	17	114563	Until the Charter_of_Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes . 
4753	br-j37	3	18	114590	The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I. ( Parti_Democratique_de_l'Independance ) , the most important minor party at the time , objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance in the civil_service and influence in Radio_Maroc . 
4754	br-j37	3	19	114629	There were rumors that the Ministry_of_the_Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings . 
4755	br-j37	3	20	114658	The day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself . 
4756	br-j37	4	21	114705	The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called_in and notices of further investigation appeared from_time_to_time . 
4757	br-j37	4	22	114732	In January , 1958 , the Minister_of_the_Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . 
4758	br-j37	4	23	114772	Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied . 
4759	br-j37	4	24	114798	In late 1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement_Populaire ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council_of_Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party . 
4760	br-j37	4	25	114838	The parties were on_the_whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after_effects of poor harvests in 1957 . 
4761	br-j37	5	26	114865	Despite the internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue . 
4762	br-j37	5	27	114881	They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held . 
4763	br-j37	5	28	114909	But the eagerly sought `` homogeneity '' of the Balafrej Council_of_Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign_policy , labor politics and economic development . 
4764	br-j37	5	29	114936	By December , 1958 , when ' Abdallah_Ibrahim became President_of_the_Council , elections had even greater importance . 
4765	br-j37	5	30	114953	They were increasingly looked_upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new , constructive national effort . 
4766	br-j37	5	31	114977	To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed a titre personnel and a special office was created in the Ministry_of_the_Interior to plan and to conduct the elections . 
4767	br-j37	5	32	115011	By this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete . 
4768	br-j37	5	33	115025	There remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws through the labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions . 
4769	br-j37	6	34	115050	From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results . 
4770	br-j37	6	35	115077	In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . 
4771	br-j37	6	36	115109	In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where there is as_yet no place for the less prominent . 
4772	br-j37	6	37	115147	Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide , minority parties , such_as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for elections when out of power , but are not at_all certain they wish_to be controlled by popular choice when in power . 
4773	br-j37	6	38	115198	Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . 
4774	br-j37	6	39	115212	The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco . 
4775	br-j37	7	40	115238	At the central level the scrutin_uninominal_voting_system was selected over some form of the scrutin_de_liste_system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political_parties . 
4776	br-j37	7	41	115268	The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections . 
4777	br-j37	7	42	115310	Although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates . 
4778	br-j37	7	43	115337	With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly . 
4779	br-j37	7	44	115365	Both parties and the Ministry_of_the_Interior were busily at_work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance . 
4780	br-j37	7	45	115403	Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation . 
4781	br-j37	8	46	115435	The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization . 
4782	br-j37	8	47	115452	The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads not_only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in_addition to contributing to more meaningful elections . 
4783	br-j37	8	48	115486	Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber_of_Commerce elections , which took_place three weeks before national elections . 
4784	br-j37	8	49	115507	The Istiqlal sponsored U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union_Marocaine_des_Commercants , Industrialistes_et_Artisans ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union_National_des_Forces_Populaires ) in nearly all urban_centers . 
4785	br-j37	8	50	115532	As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen , the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more progressive , labor based U.N.F.P. The newer party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small_businessmen to support them as they had done for many years . 
4786	br-j37	8	51	115587	The local Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A. offices did not campaign and lost heavily . 
4787	br-j37	8	52	115600	The value of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in Table /1 , . 
4788	br-j37	9	53	115632	The chamber_of_Commerce elections were , of_course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections . 
4789	br-j37	9	54	115650	The U.N.F.P. learned that its urban organization , which depends heavily on U.M.T. support , was most effective . 
4790	br-j37	9	55	115669	The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete , precise problems of internal politics . 
4791	br-j37	9	56	115695	The overall effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than might have otherwise taken_place . 
4792	br-j37	10	57	115715	A second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections . 
4793	br-j37	10	58	115732	Although a somewhat technical subject , it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting_system indicated . 
4794	br-j37	10	59	115752	Furthermore , the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results . 
4795	br-j37	10	60	115780	The sine_qua_non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure . 
4796	br-j37	10	61	115793	As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated_by either party could fairly administer elections . 
4797	br-j37	10	62	115814	The P.D.I. and later the Popular_Movement protected the Istiqlal 's `` privileged position '' until the fall of Balafrej , and_then the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the pro U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim government . 
4798	br-j37	11	63	115858	The bulk of the preparation had , of_course , proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry_of_the_Interior , whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics . 
4799	br-j37	11	64	115890	Apart from some areas of recurring trouble , like Bani_Mellal , where inexperienced officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process . 
4800	br-j37	11	65	115921	Centrally , however , the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage . 
4801	br-j37	11	66	115944	The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party Council_of_Government under his personal direction . 
4802	br-j37	11	67	115965	Although the monarch had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance , his action was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor . 
4803	br-j37	11	68	115994	The new Council was itself inescapably of political meaning , which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U.N.F.P. members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders . 
4804	br-j37	11	69	116024	Since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the U.N.F.P. 
4805	br-j37	12	70	116063	Voting preparations began in the fall of 1959 , although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes was completed in 1958 . 
4806	br-j37	12	71	116087	There were three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of voters and the registration of candidates . 
4807	br-j37	12	72	116110	Voter registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960 . 
4808	br-j37	12	73	116125	The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response . 
4809	br-j37	12	74	116137	Periodic bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials . 
4810	br-j37	12	75	116158	A goal was fixed , as given in Table 2 , and attention focused_on its fulfillment . 
4811	br-j37	12	76	116175	The qualifications to vote were kept very simple . 
4812	br-j37	12	77	116184	Both men and women of twenty-one years of_age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification . 
4813	br-j37	12	78	116204	There were liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or records were lacking . 
4814	br-j37	12	79	116217	The police were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens , criminals and those punished for Protectorate activities . 
4815	br-j37	13	80	116237	The registration figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit of a reliable census . 
4816	br-j52	1	1	116265	But neither was the statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard . 
4817	br-j52	1	2	116289	What were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value ? 
4818	br-j52	1	3	116304	To find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded_as their most important discovery . 
4819	br-j52	1	4	116337	It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only . 
4820	br-j52	1	5	116350	If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at_all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` Hurrah '' or `` Fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at_rest . 
4821	br-j52	1	6	116402	This is the course the positivists took . 
4822	br-j52	1	7	116410	They explained value judgments by explaining them away . 
4823	br-j52	2	8	116419	Now I do not think their view will do . 
4824	br-j52	2	9	116429	But before discussing it , I should_like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case . 
4825	br-j52	2	10	116455	It has been said of John_Stuart_Mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found_out . 
4826	br-j52	2	11	116472	This theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind , and this I will do my best to supply . 
4827	br-j52	2	12	116500	The theory claims to show by analysis that when we say , `` That is good '' , we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking . 
4828	br-j52	2	13	116535	I shall argue that we do mean to do just that . 
4829	br-j52	3	14	116547	Let us work_through an example , and the simpler and commoner the better . 
4830	br-j52	3	15	116561	There is perhaps no value_statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain is bad . 
4831	br-j52	3	16	116582	Let us take a set of circumstances in which I happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which I think every one of us might naturally make such a statement . 
4832	br-j52	3	17	116616	We come_upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in common use . 
4833	br-j52	3	18	116634	There are signs that it has struggled for days to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger , pain , and fear , it has all_but eaten off its own leg . 
4834	br-j52	3	19	116667	The attempt failed : the animal is now dead . 
4835	br-j52	3	20	116677	As we think_of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered , we are very likely to say : `` It was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so '' . 
4836	br-j52	3	21	116712	The positivist tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion . 
4837	br-j52	3	22	116729	I hold , on_the_contrary , that we mean to assert something of the pain itself , namely , that it was bad - bad when and as it occurred . 
4838	br-j52	4	23	116759	Consider what follows from the positivist view . 
4839	br-j52	4	24	116767	On that view , nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came_on the scene and made my remark . 
4840	br-j52	4	25	116789	For what I express in my remark is something going_on in me at the time , and that of_course did not exist until I did come_on the scene . 
4841	br-j52	4	26	116818	The pain of the rabbit was not itself bad ; nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured ; badness , in the only sense in which it is involved at_all , waited for its appearance till I came and looked and felt . 
4842	br-j52	4	27	116864	Now that this is at_odds with our meaning may be shown as_follows . 
4843	br-j52	4	28	116877	Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come_on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered . 
4844	br-j52	4	29	116899	Are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did ? 
4845	br-j52	4	30	116921	Clearly not . 
4846	br-j52	4	31	116924	Indeed we should say , on_the_contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal 's pain , that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not . 
4847	br-j52	4	32	116976	If so , then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only . 
4848	br-j52	4	33	116998	We are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it . 
4849	br-j52	5	34	117020	The first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference . 
4850	br-j52	5	35	117037	It removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this , whereas on positivist grounds it should be . 
4851	br-j52	5	36	117064	The second argument applies the method in the reverse way . 
4852	br-j52	5	37	117075	It ideally removes the past event , and shows that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist grounds it should not . 
4853	br-j52	5	38	117103	Let us suppose that the animal did not in_fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at_all , but that we mistakenly believe it did , and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing . 
4854	br-j52	5	39	117142	On the positivist theory , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second . 
4855	br-j52	5	40	117167	In the only sense in which badness is involved at_all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still there . 
4856	br-j52	5	41	117213	And our question is , is such an implication consistent with what we meant ? 
4857	br-j52	5	42	117228	Clearly it is not . 
4858	br-j52	5	43	117233	If anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at_all , we should say that it made all the difference in_the_world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our assertion was in that case mistaken . 
4859	br-j52	5	44	117332	The suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after_all making no mistake , because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering , seems to me merely frivolous . 
4860	br-j52	5	45	117368	If we did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred ? 
4861	br-j52	5	46	117392	On the theory before us , such relief would be groundless , for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at_all , and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved about . 
4862	br-j52	5	47	117429	The positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition . 
4863	br-j52	6	48	117440	So_far_as I can see , there is only one way_out for the positivist . 
4864	br-j52	6	49	117454	He holds that goodness and badness lie_in feelings of approval or disapproval . 
4865	br-j52	6	50	117467	And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging_to the pain itself . 
4866	br-j52	6	51	117495	The pain in itself was neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no grounds at_all , took_up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for_the_first_time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad . 
4867	br-j52	6	52	117536	This way of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so_far_as I know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it . 
4868	br-j52	7	53	117577	I come now to a third argument , which again is very simple . 
4869	br-j52	7	54	117591	When we come_upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling . 
4870	br-j52	7	55	117631	But suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again . 
4871	br-j52	7	56	117650	And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in_the_first_place has faded . 
4872	br-j52	7	57	117672	The pathetic evidence is no_longer before us ; and we are now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling is , as_we_say , quite dead . 
4873	br-j52	7	58	117699	In these circumstances , since what was expressed by the remark when first made is , on the theory before us , simply absent , the remark now expresses nothing . 
4874	br-j52	7	59	117730	It is as empty as the word `` Hurrah '' would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it . 
4875	br-j52	7	60	117750	And this seems to me untrue . 
4876	br-j52	7	61	117757	When we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing , the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing_point , but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before , we should certainly answer Yes . 
4877	br-j52	7	62	117808	We should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time , but that it was the same point we were making . 
4878	br-j52	7	63	117841	And if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same , while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero , it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express . 
4879	br-j52	8	64	117878	I come now to a fourth consideration . 
4880	br-j52	8	65	117886	We all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not ; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make_sense . 
4881	br-j52	8	66	117919	Broad and Ross have lately contended that this fitness is one of the main facts of ethics , and I suspect they are right . 
4882	br-j52	8	67	117944	But that is not exactly my point . 
4883	br-j52	8	68	117952	My point is this : 
4884	br-j52	8	69	117957	whether there is such fitness or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do . 
4885	br-j52	8	70	117990	Let me illustrate . 
4886	br-j52	9	71	117994	In his novel The_House_of_the_Dead , Dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a Siberian prison_camp . 
4887	br-j52	9	72	118009	Whatever the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today , Dostoevsky 's companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined . 
4888	br-j52	9	73	118034	`` I have heard stories '' , he writes , `` of the most terrible , the most unnatural actions , of the most monstrous murders , told with the most spontaneous , childishly merry laughter '' . 
4889	br-j52	9	74	118072	Most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting . 
4890	br-j52	9	75	118097	If we were asked why we thought so , we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong , and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting . 
4891	br-j52	9	76	118134	Now on the subjectivist view , this answer is ruled_out . 
4892	br-j52	9	77	118145	For before someone takes_up an attitude toward death , suffering , or their infliction , they have no moral quality at_all . 
4893	br-j52	9	78	118167	There is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting . 
4894	br-j52	9	79	118185	They are in themselves neutral , and , so_far_as they get a moral quality , they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker . 
4895	br-j52	9	80	118216	But if that is true , why is any attitude more fitting than any other ? 
4896	br-j52	9	81	118232	Would applause , for_example , be fitting if , apart from the applause , there were nothing good to applaud ? 
4897	br-j52	9	82	118253	Would condemnation be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there were nothing bad to condemn ? 
4898	br-j52	9	83	118271	In such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point . 
4899	br-j52	10	84	118300	Indeed we are forced to go much farther . 
4900	br-j52	10	85	118309	If goodness and badness lie_in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line . 
4901	br-j52	10	86	118343	If there is nothing evil in these things , if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them , why should n't they be greeted with a cheer ? 
4902	br-j52	10	87	118375	To greet them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; it would needlessly bring badness into the world ; and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright . 
4903	br-j52	10	88	118411	On_the_other_hand , to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good ; it would bring goodness into the world . 
4904	br-j53	1	1	118436	The injured German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head . 
4905	br-j53	1	2	118462	This resulted in damage to the occipital_lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . 
4906	br-j53	1	3	118481	In_any_event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` psychically blind '' , while at_the_same_time , apparently , the sense_of_touch remained essentially intact . 
4907	br-j53	1	4	118509	Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for_example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure_up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . 
4908	br-j53	1	5	118557	This circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at_hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that_is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . 
4909	br-j53	1	6	118616	The necessary inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense_of_touch , as_such . 
4910	br-j53	1	7	118650	We do not arrive_at spatial images by means of the sense_of_touch by itself . 
4911	br-j53	1	8	118664	( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual representations ; that_is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual_space '' . 
4912	br-j53	1	9	118695	The underlying assumption , of_course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way , to locate objects in space beyond us , the other senses being decidedly inferior , if_not totally inadequate , in this regard . 
4913	br-j53	1	10	118741	This is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel . 
4914	br-j53	1	11	118754	Therefore , if the sense_of_touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary . 
4915	br-j53	2	12	118815	The force of the authors ' analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered . 
4916	br-j53	2	13	118849	( 1 ) What allows us to think that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his eyes were closed ? 
4917	br-j53	2	14	118870	( 2 ) What evidence is there that he was psychically blind ? 
4918	br-j53	2	15	118883	( 3 ) How can we be sure that his sense_of_touch was not profoundly disturbed by his head injury ? 
4919	br-j53	2	16	118903	We shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation . 
4920	br-j53	3	17	118915	Obviously , a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative , if the argument is to get under_way at_all , for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient 's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion , any findings whatsoever in regard_to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of_course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion . 
4921	br-j53	3	18	118983	The answer the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance . 
4922	br-j53	3	19	118998	It is as_follows : `` The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness ( pressure , pain , temperature ) , as_well_as the kinesthetic sensations ( muscular feelings , feelings in the tendons and joints ) , were , as_such , essentially intact , although they seemed , in_comparison_with normal reactions , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body . 
4923	br-j53	3	20	119062	The supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as_well_as the direction and scope of a movement , passively executed ( with one of his members ) , proved to have been , on_the_contrary , very considerably affected '' . 
4924	br-j53	3	21	119116	The authors insist , however , that these abnormalities in the sense_of_touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight . 
4925	br-j53	4	22	119155	First_of_all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged ? 
4926	br-j53	4	23	119169	( 1 ) When an object was placed in the patient 's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it was made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and_so_on . 
4927	br-j53	4	24	119237	And he could recognize , by touch alone , articles which he had handled immediately before , even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him ; that_is , he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was . 
4928	br-j53	4	25	119287	( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . 
4929	br-j53	4	26	119301	Because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation requiring a great_deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . 
4930	br-j53	4	27	119355	It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . 
4931	br-j53	4	28	119429	And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing facts [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - was unimpaired '' . 
4932	br-j53	5	29	119529	If the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense_of_touch can be explained by his defective visual condition . 
4933	br-j53	5	30	119575	But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand . 
4934	br-j53	6	31	119615	In what ways , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ? 
4935	br-j53	6	32	119630	He could not see objects as unified , self-contained , and organized figures , as a person does with normal vision . 
4936	br-j53	6	33	119652	The meaning of_this , as we shall see , is that he had no fund of visual memory-images of objects as objects ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again . 
4937	br-j53	6	34	119691	Instead , he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects , and_so_on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in_question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours . 
4938	br-j53	6	35	119745	According_to his own testimony , he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots '' of color of a more_or_less indefinite size ; at their edges they slipped pretty_much out_of_focus altogether . 
4939	br-j53	6	36	119782	But by the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner , find the unseen form ; could piece , as_it_were , the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and_then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned_out to be . 
4940	br-j53	6	37	119832	If , however , the figure to be discerned were complicated , composed of several interlocking subfigures , and_so_on , even the tracing process failed him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts . 
4941	br-j53	6	38	119872	This meant , concretely , that the patient could not read at_all without making writing like movements of the head or body , became easily confused by `` hasher_marks '' inserted between hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters , and could recognize a simple straight_line or a curved one only by tracing it . 
4942	br-j53	7	39	119932	The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at_all ; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him . 
4943	br-j53	7	40	119957	After a conversation with another man , he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at_all what the other man looked_like . 
4944	br-j53	7	41	119986	Nor could he call_up memory-pictures of close friends or relatives . 
4945	br-j53	7	42	119997	In_short , both his own declarations and his figural_blindness , when he looked at objects , seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at_all . 
4946	br-j53	7	43	120027	He was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape , already learned and held in visual memory , as persons of normal vision do . 
4947	br-j53	7	44	120067	He could not recognize it ; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at_all . 
4948	br-j53	7	45	120087	Therefore , his only recourse was to learn the shape all_over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object ; and this he could do only by going_over its mass with the tracing procedure . 
4949	br-j53	7	46	120129	Then he might finally recognize it , apparently by combining the visual blot , actually being seen , with tactual feelings in_the_head or body accompanying the tracing movements . 
4950	br-j53	7	47	120158	This would mean , it can readily be seen , that , again , for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have_to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery . 
4951	br-j53	8	48	120192	As one would surmise , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as_to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference . 
4952	br-j53	8	49	120254	Men , trees , automobiles , houses , and_so_on - objects continually confronted in everyday life - had each its characteristic blot appearance and became easily recognizable , at the very beginning of tracing , by an inference as_to what each was . 
4953	br-j53	8	50	120297	Dice , for_example , he inferred from black dots on a white surface . 
4954	br-j53	8	51	120311	He evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects , but their size and the dots gave them away . 
4955	br-j53	8	52	120333	And the authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient 's part to show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it . 
4956	br-j53	8	53	120369	Often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly , without the tracing motions , solely on the basis of qualitative differences among the blot like things which appeared in his visual experience . 
4957	br-j53	9	54	120405	Perhaps the very important question - What is , then , exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient 's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things ? 
4958	br-j53	9	55	120446	- has now been raised in the reader 's mind and in the following form . 
4959	br-j53	9	56	120462	If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense_of_touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in_independence_of visual representations , at_least in regard_to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on_the_part_of unaided touch is denied by the authors . 
4960	br-j53	9	57	120524	How , then , do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this ? 
4961	br-j53	9	58	120537	The authors set_about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient 's ability , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in space , with his eyes closed ( or turned_away from the object concerned ) . 
4962	br-j53	9	59	120585	Quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at_all and_then , later , by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to . 
4963	br-j53	10	60	120624	When the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at_all , the following striking results occurred . 
4964	br-j54	1	1	120645	Whenever artists , indeed , turned_to actual representations or molded three-dimensional_figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century . 
4965	br-j54	2	2	120699	To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . 
4966	br-j54	2	3	120717	At_the_least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . 
4967	br-j54	2	4	120752	Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . 
4968	br-j54	2	5	120776	And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go_too_far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . 
4969	br-j54	2	6	120802	The storms of the past had died_away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not_yet begun to disturb men 's minds . 
4970	br-j54	3	7	120830	Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself . 
4971	br-j54	3	8	120846	In the vases this spirit may perhaps at_times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world . 
4972	br-j54	3	9	120885	The ninth century was in its artistic work `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future '' , and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated . 
4973	br-j54	4	10	120934	Geometric pottery has not_yet received the thorough , detailed study which it deserves , partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations , as at Argos , are only now coming_to_light . 
4974	br-j54	4	11	120974	From even a cursory inspection of its many aspects , however , the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C. 
4975	br-j54	5	12	121004	The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree . 
4976	br-j54	5	13	121023	Much which was in_embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 . 
4977	br-j54	5	14	121037	In this process the Minoan Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 . 
4978	br-j54	5	15	121072	Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times - granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside - are correct ; but all_too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took_place in the early first millennium . 
4979	br-j54	6	16	121130	The focus of novelty in this world now lay_in the south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always excepting its northern shores , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery . 
4980	br-j54	6	17	121169	While Protogeometric vases usually turn_up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as_many or more examples of local stamp , these `` non Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century . 
4981	br-j54	6	18	121205	In their place came local variations within the common style - tentative , as_it_were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed . 
4982	br-j54	6	19	121235	Attica , though important , was not the only teacher of this age . 
4983	br-j54	6	20	121249	One can take a vase of about 800 B.C. and , without any knowledge of its place_of_origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable . 
4984	br-j54	6	21	121285	The potters of the Aegean_islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland , and in Greece itself Argive , Corinthian , Attic , Boeotian , and other Geometric sequences have each their own hallmarks . 
4985	br-j54	6	22	121321	These local variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half . 
4986	br-j54	7	23	121337	The same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark_ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survivals of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages . 
4987	br-j54	7	24	121373	By 800 B.C. the Aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture . 
4988	br-j54	7	25	121389	On these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the Iliad . 
4989	br-j54	7	26	121415	Everywhere within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; Greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors . 
4990	br-j54	8	27	121449	Further we cannot go , for the Dark_ages deserve their name . 
4991	br-j54	8	28	121461	Many aspects of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure . 
4992	br-j54	8	29	121489	The epic_poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political_units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men - all these had to await the progress of following decades . 
4993	br-j54	8	30	121528	What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . 
4994	br-j54	8	31	121555	These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces . 
4995	br-j54	9	32	121588	To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period . 
4996	br-j54	9	33	121646	The historian can only point_out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding . 
4997	br-j54	9	34	121676	Throughout the Dark_ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently . 
4998	br-j54	9	35	121694	The pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood_on_firm_ground . 
4999	br-j54	10	36	121709	The landscape of Greek history broadens widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century B.C. , the age of Homer 's `` rosy fingered Dawn '' . 
5000	br-j54	10	37	121738	The first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world ; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change . 
5001	br-j54	10	38	121778	For this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; the ceramic material of the age is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative_of the hopes and fears of its makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death . 
5002	br-j54	10	39	121829	Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece ; objects in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous . 
5003	br-j54	10	40	121855	Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful . 
5004	br-j54	10	41	121883	Though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the Iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750 . 
5005	br-j54	11	42	121915	The Dipylon_Geometric pottery of Athens and the Iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of Greek civilization ; but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending . 
5006	br-j54	11	43	121948	Greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth . 
5007	br-j54	11	44	121972	The revolution was well under_way before 700 B.C. , and premonitory signs go_back virtually across the century . 
5008	br-j54	11	45	121990	The era , however , is Janus-faced . 
5009	br-j54	11	46	121998	While many tokens point forward , the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns of the Dark_ages . 
5010	br-j54	11	47	122019	The dominant pottery of the century was Geometric ; political organization revolved_about the basileis ; trade was just beginning to expand ; the gods who protected the Greek countryside were only now putting_on their sharply anthropomorphic dress . 
5011	br-j54	12	48	122057	The modern student , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century . 
5012	br-j54	12	49	122086	Not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis . 
5013	br-j54	12	50	122098	Many potters clung_to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas ; the poet of the Iliad deliberately archaized . 
5014	br-j54	12	51	122123	Although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era , I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of Greek civilization . 
5015	br-j54	13	52	122167	On this principle of division I must postpone the evolution of sculpture , architecture , society , and politics ; for the developments in these areas make_sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself . 
5016	br-j54	13	53	122206	The growing contacts between Aegean and Orient are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture after 750 . 
5017	br-j54	13	54	122232	We shall not be able entirely to pass_over these connections to the East as we consider Ripe_Geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious evolution of early Greece ; the important point , however , is that these magnificent achievements , unlike those of later decades , were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models . 
5018	br-j54	13	55	122291	The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the Iliad lie_in the Aegean past . 
5019	br-j54	14	56	122305	The pottery of the first_half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe_Geometric . 
5020	br-j54	14	57	122319	The severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years , the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying Geometric pottery ; but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance . 
5021	br-j54	14	58	122364	The vases which resulted had different shapes , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style . 
5022	br-j54	15	59	122384	Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines . 
5023	br-j54	15	60	122405	In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos . 
5024	br-j54	15	61	122424	They had had_to work_on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses . 
5025	br-j54	15	62	122441	The potters , in_particular , had virtually eschewed freehand drawing , elaborate motifs , and the curving lines of nature , while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe . 
5026	br-j54	15	63	122475	In their vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization , at_first hesitantly in Protogeometric work , and_then more confidently in the initial stages of the Geometric style . 
5027	br-j54	15	64	122508	By 800 social and cultural security had been achieved , at_least on a simple plane ; it was time to take bigger steps , to venture on experiments . 
5028	br-j54	16	65	122537	Ripe_Geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited . 
5029	br-j54	16	66	122565	In these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress . 
5030	br-j54	16	67	122584	To the ancestral lore , however , new materials were added . 
5031	br-j54	16	68	122596	Painters left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color ; instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns into which freehand drawing began to creep . 
5032	br-j54	16	69	122632	Wavy lines , feather like patterns , rosettes of indefinitely floral nature , birds either singly or in stylized rows , animals in solemn frieze bands ( see Plates 11 - 12 ) - all these turned_up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze . 
5033	br-j54	16	70	122685	The rows of animals and birds , in_particular , suggest awareness of Oriental animal friezes , transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls and textiles , but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek . 
5034	br-j54	16	71	122727	Though the spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not_yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the Cyclades , which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century . 
5035	br-j54	17	72	122765	As the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident . 
5036	br-j54	17	73	122794	Plate 12 illustrates four examples , which are Ripe or Late_Geometric work of common spirit but of different schools . 
5037	br-j55	1	1	122814	Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a_few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . 
5038	br-j55	1	2	122838	Thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . 
5039	br-j55	1	3	122852	Even while suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian . 
5040	br-j55	2	4	122874	Three weeks later following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district_attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez . 
5041	br-j55	2	5	122905	Arriving at daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . 
5042	br-j55	2	6	122921	Instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun forcing them to kill him , Cook reported . 
5043	br-j55	3	7	122942	Both Cook 's and Russell 's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in_the_end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . 
5044	br-j55	3	8	122977	General_manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather_than accept their offers to sell_out and move away , and try to have a_few punished . 
5045	br-j55	4	9	123009	On February 17 , Russell and Cook were sent to the Pena_Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting_out ranches the company had purchased . 
5046	br-j55	4	10	123035	While talking with Julian_M._Beall , Francisco_Archuleta and Juan_Marcus appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for_a_while , rode_away . 
5047	br-j55	4	11	123058	It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and began riding down the stream . 
5048	br-j55	4	12	123076	They had traveled only a short distance when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them . 
5049	br-j55	4	13	123100	Suspecting an ambush , the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short_cut into Catskill . 
5050	br-j55	5	14	123120	After spending two nights ( Wednesday and Thursday ) in Catskill , the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business . 
5051	br-j55	5	15	123144	They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old Garnett_Lee ranch . 
5052	br-j55	5	16	123163	Half a mile below at the mouth of Salyer_'s_Canyon was an old ranch that the company had purchased from A._J._Armstrong , occupied by a Mexican , his wife , and an old trapper . 
5053	br-j55	5	17	123197	There were three houses in Salyer_'s_Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff , the road winding along the top , entering above , and_then passing down in_front_of the houses , thence to the Vermejo . 
5054	br-j55	5	18	123234	To the west of this road was another low bluff , forty or fifty feet high , covered with scrub_oak and other brush . 
5055	br-j55	5	19	123258	As they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two bluffs , a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers . 
5056	br-j55	5	20	123288	Not a bullet touched Cook who was nearer the ambush , but one hit Russell in the leg and another broke his arm , passing_on through his body . 
5057	br-j55	6	21	123317	With the first reports , Russell 's horse wheeled to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook , followed by a hail of bullets , raced towards the arroyo of Salyer_'s_Canyon immediately in_front_of him , just reaching it as his horse fell . 
5058	br-j55	6	22	123362	Grabbing his Winchester from its sheath , Cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank . 
5059	br-j55	6	23	123379	Bullets were so thick , throwing sand in his face , that he found it difficult to return the fire . 
5060	br-j55	6	24	123400	Noticing Russell 's horse in_front_of the long log building , he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put_up a good fight , so he began working his way down the ditch to join him . 
5061	br-j55	6	25	123440	At a very shallow place , two Mexicans rushed into the open for a shot . 
5062	br-j55	6	26	123456	Dropping to one knee , Cook felled one , and the other struggled off with his comrade , sending no further fire in his direction . 
5063	br-j55	6	27	123482	Just before leaving the arroyo where he was partially concealed , he did hear shots down at the house . 
5064	br-j55	7	28	123502	Russell had reached the house as Cook surmised , dismounted , but just as the old trapper opened the door to receive him , he fell into the trapper 's arms - dead . 
5065	br-j55	7	29	123536	A bullet fired by one of the Mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed_through his head , tearing a hole two inches square on the outgoing side . 
5066	br-j55	7	30	123566	Finding him dead , Cook caught Russell 's horse and rode to the cattle foreman 's house to report the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins . 
5067	br-j55	8	31	123595	Before daylight Sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of Deputy_Sheriff_Frank_MacPherson of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco_Chaves , where 100 to 150 Mexicans had gathered . 
5068	br-j55	8	32	123629	MacPherson boldly approached the fortified adobe_house and demanded entrance . 
5069	br-j55	8	33	123639	The men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even_though he offered medical_aid . 
5070	br-j55	8	34	123666	The officer demanded the names of the injured men ; the Mexicans not_only refused to give them , but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it . 
5071	br-j55	8	35	123698	Since the strength of the Mexicans had been underrated , too small a posse had been collected , and since the deputy had not been provided with search_warrants , MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw . 
5072	br-j55	9	36	123739	The posse 's retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be overbearing and impudent . 
5073	br-j55	9	37	123752	During the following week , six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned ; some buildings , farm tools , two horses , plows , and hay owned by Bonito_Lavato , a friendly interpreter for the company , and Pedro_Chavez ' hay were stolen or destroyed ; and a store was broken into and robbed . 
5074	br-j55	9	38	123810	District_Attorney M._W._Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms - he just did n't catch anyone . 
5075	br-j55	10	39	123834	Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New_Mexico . 
5076	br-j55	10	40	123848	His friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense , perpetuating the troubles . 
5077	br-j55	10	41	123883	By early summer , he wrote from Laramie that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in_a_bad_way financially , so Pels sent him a draft for $ 100 , warning that it was still not wise for him to return . 
5078	br-j55	10	42	123929	Pels also sent a check for $ 100 to Russell 's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his grave . 
5079	br-j55	11	43	123952	Cattle stealing and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , placed the land_grant company officers in a perplexing position . 
5080	br-j55	11	44	123975	They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property , thus running_the_risk of creating disturbances such_as that on the Vermejo , and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle_thieves and running_the_risk of being shot . 
5081	br-j55	11	45	124016	And the law virtually ignored the situation . 
5082	br-j55	11	46	124024	The judge became ill just as the Colfax_District_Court convened , no substitute was brought_in , no criminal cases heard , only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried , and court adjourned sine_die after sitting a_few days instead_of the usual three weeks . 
5083	br-j55	11	47	124068	Pels complained : 
5084	br-j55	11	48	124071	`` Litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact business ; public money spent ; justice delayed ; nothing accomplished , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute farce '' . 
5085	br-j55	12	49	124117	Word reached the company that the man behind these depredations was Manuel_Gonzales , a man with many followers , including a number who were kept in line through fear of him . 
5086	br-j55	12	50	124149	Although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old_man named Asher_Jones , the warrant for his arrest had never been served . 
5087	br-j55	12	51	124171	On May 19 , a deputy_sheriff 's posse of eight men left Maxwell_City and rode thirty-five miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan_Jose_Martinez . 
5088	br-j55	12	52	124198	By 3 : 00 A.M. they reached his house and found it vacant . 
5089	br-j55	12	53	124212	When they were refused entrance to his brother 's house nearby , they smashed down the door , broke the window , and threw lighted clothes wet with kerosene into the room . 
5090	br-j55	12	54	124245	Still there was no Gonzales and the family would say nothing . 
5091	br-j55	13	55	124257	About 300 yards up the creek was a cluster of Mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a square . 
5092	br-j55	13	56	124279	While prowling around these buildings , two of the posse recognized the voice of Gonzales speaking_to the people inside . 
5093	br-j55	13	57	124299	He was promised that no harm would befall him if he would come_out , but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming_near the door . 
5094	br-j55	13	58	124328	The posse then asked that he send_out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn_down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive . 
5095	br-j55	13	59	124359	Again he refused . 
5096	br-j55	13	60	124363	In deadly earnest , the besiegers methodically stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags inside , only to have most stamped_out by the women as_soon_as they hit the floor . 
5097	br-j55	13	61	124396	When it became obvious that he could stay inside no_longer , taking a_thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside , square against the muzzle of a Winchester . 
5098	br-j55	13	62	124424	Shot near the heart , he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away , three bullets following him . 
5099	br-j55	13	63	124451	As he pushed open the door he fell on his face , one of his comrades pulling him inside . 
5100	br-j55	14	64	124471	Not realizing the seriousness of the wound , the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned_down around him . 
5101	br-j55	14	65	124496	Receiving no answer , they set the fire . 
5102	br-j55	14	66	124505	When the house was about half consumed , his comrade ran to the door and threw up his hands , declaring repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of Manuel . 
5103	br-j55	14	67	124537	Finding it true that he was not inside , the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket . 
5104	br-j55	14	68	124576	Several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand . 
5105	br-j55	14	69	124593	Shot six or eight times the body was draped with Russell 's pistol , belt , and cartridges . 
5106	br-j55	14	70	124612	There was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who , though numbering in the fifties , had stood around on the hillside nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack . 
5107	br-j55	15	71	124648	Early the next morning , a Mexican telephoned Pels that Celso_Chavez , one of the posse members , was surrounded by ten Mexicans at his father 's home on the upper Vermejo . 
5108	br-j55	15	72	124681	The sheriff and District_Attorney_Mills hastily swore_out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed , according_to signed statements by Chavez and Dr._I._P._George , and ordered Deputy_Barney_Clark of Raton to rescue the posseman . 
5109	br-j55	15	73	124718	Traveling all night , Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock May 22 . 
5110	br-j55	15	74	124734	Occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a number of horsemen were sighted on the hills , disappearing at the posse 's approach . 
5111	br-j55	15	75	124757	A Mexican justice_of_the_peace had issue a writ against Chavez for taking_part in the `` murder '' of Manuel_Gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken_out of danger . 
5112	br-j55	15	76	124788	The men helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to Raton along with three other families desiring to leave . 
5113	br-j55	16	77	124809	The ten or more dangerous parties singled_out for prosecution were still at_large , and Pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe_houses , defending themselves through loopholes , it would be most difficult to capture them . 
5114	br-j55	16	78	124849	Thus he wired J._P._Lower_and_Sons of Denver : `` Have you any percussion hand_grenades for throwing in a house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot ? 
5115	br-j55	16	79	124878	If_not , how long to order and what is the price '' ? 
5116	br-j55	16	80	124891	He wisely decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup , particularly since the Mexicans were on their guard . 
5117	br-j55	16	81	124917	His problem then became one of restraining the American fighters who wanted to clean_out the Vermejo by force immediately . 
5118	br-j56	1	1	124937	The plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric_light plant . 
5119	br-j56	2	2	124956	The Manchester_Depot_Sewer_Company issued 214 shares of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance . 
5120	br-j56	2	3	124984	It has given considerable trouble at_times and empties right into the Battenkill . 
5121	br-j56	2	4	124997	Fire_District_No._1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment . 
5122	br-j56	3	5	125012	The sewer on Bonnet_Street was constructed when there were only a_few houses on the street . 
5123	br-j56	3	6	125028	as new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School_Street are served by it . 
5124	br-j56	3	7	125048	B._J._Connell is the present treasurer and manager . 
5125	br-j56	4	8	125056	The 1946 town_meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage_disposal and a disposal_plant to serve Manchester_Center , Depot , and Way_'s_Lane . 
5126	br-j56	4	9	125091	The committee submitted a report signed by Louis_Martin and Leon_Wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report . 
5127	br-j56	4	10	125111	The layout of the sewer_lines was designed by Henry_W._Taylor , who was the engineer for the Manchester_Village disposal_plant . 
5128	br-j56	4	11	125130	No figures were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town . 
5129	br-j56	5	12	125148	The 1958 town_meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities . 
5130	br-j56	5	13	125177	The final step was a vote for a $ 230000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage_system by the 1959 town_meeting , later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special town_meeting June_21 , 1960 . 
5131	br-j56	6	14	125214	There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams . 
5132	br-j56	7	15	125240	Manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev._J._D._Wickham , headmaster of Burr and Burton_Seminary , was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , Samuel_F._B._Morse . 
5133	br-j56	7	16	125275	At_any_rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington . 
5134	br-j56	8	17	125297	In 1846 Matthew_B._Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox_House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' . 
5135	br-j56	8	18	125343	Goodwin was telegrapher for the `` American_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Troy_and_Canada_Junction_Telegraph_Company '' . 
5136	br-j56	8	19	125357	Shares of capital_stock at $ 15 each in the latter company were payable at the Bank_of_Manchester or at various other Vermont banks . 
5137	br-j56	8	20	125380	A message of less_than fifteen words to Bennington cost twenty-five cents . 
5138	br-j56	9	21	125392	By 1871 L._C._Orvis , manager of the `` Western_Union_Telegraph_Company '' , expressed willingness to send emergency telegrams on Sundays from his Village drugstore . 
5139	br-j56	9	22	125416	Orvis even needed to hire an assistant , Clark_J._Wait . 
5140	br-j56	9	23	125426	The Manchester_Journal commented editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business . 
5141	br-j56	10	24	125439	In the fall of 1878 , the `` Popular_Telegraph_Line '' was established between Manchester and Factory_Point by the owners , Paul_W._Orvis , Henry_Gray , J._N._Hard , and Clark_J._Wait . 
5142	br-j56	10	25	125468	The line soon lived_up_to its name , as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital_stock . 
5143	br-j56	11	26	125502	In 1879 the same Clark_Wait , with H._H._Holley of South_Dorset , formed the `` American_Telegraph_Line '' , extending from Manchester_Depot via Factory_Point and South_Dorset to Dorset . 
5144	br-j56	11	27	125529	Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners '' . 
5145	br-j56	11	28	125547	Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron_C._Burr and Mark_Manley of `` Burr_and_Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry_goods . 
5146	br-j56	12	29	125569	Early equipment was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles , making communications impossible . 
5147	br-j56	12	30	125587	But companies continued to spring_up . 
5148	br-j56	12	31	125593	By 1883 the `` Battenkill_Telegraph_Company '' was in existence and Alvin_Pettibone was its president . 
5149	br-j56	12	32	125608	Operating in 1887 was the `` Valley_Telegraph_Line '' , officers of which were E._C._Orvis , president ; H._K._Fowler , vice-president and secretary ; J._N._Hard , treasurer ; F._H._Walker , superintendent ; H._S._Walker , assistant superintendent . 
5150	br-j56	12	33	125644	Two companies now had headquarters with Clark_J._Wait , who by then had his own drugstore at Factory_Point - the `` Northern_Union_Telegraph_Company '' and the `` Western_Union '' . 
5151	br-j56	12	34	125672	Operators were Arthur_Koop and Norman_Taylor . 
5152	br-j56	12	35	125678	Still existing on a `` Northern_Union '' telegraph_form is a typical peremptory message from Peru grocer J._J._Hapgood to Burton and Graves ' store in Manchester - `` Get and send by stage sure four pounds best Porterhouse or sirloin steak , for Mrs._Hapgood send six sweet_oranges '' . 
5153	br-j56	13	36	125726	About 1888 J._E._McNaughton of Barnumville and E._G._Bacon became proprietors of the `` Green_Mountain_Telegraph_Company '' , connecting all offices on the Western_Union line and extending over the mountain from Barnumville to Peru , Londonderry , South_Londonderry , Lowell_Lake , Windham , North_Windham , Grafton , Cambridgeport , Saxton_'s_River , and Bellows_Falls . 
5154	br-j56	14	37	125777	From 1896 until 1910 John_H._Whipple was manager of Western_Union at the Center in the drugstore he purchased from Clark_Wait . 
5155	br-j56	14	38	125797	The Village office of Western_Union with George_Towsley as manager and telegrapher continued in Hard 's drugstore until 1905 . 
5156	br-j56	14	39	125816	During the summers , Towsley often needed the assistance of a company_operator . 
5157	br-j56	15	40	125829	These were the years when people flocked to Manchester not_only to play golf , which had come into vogue , but also to witness the Ekwanok Country_Club tournaments . 
5158	br-j56	15	41	125858	New_Yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers . 
5159	br-j56	15	42	125879	This boosted local telegraph business and Manchester basked in all the free advertising . 
5160	br-j56	15	43	125893	In 1914 when the town was chosen for the U._S._Amateur_Golf tournament , a representative hurried here from the Boston manager 's office . 
5161	br-j56	15	44	125916	In his wake came the District_Traffic_Supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession , ten of Boston 's best , chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf . 
5162	br-j56	15	45	125947	During that tournament alone , some 250000 words winged their way out of Manchester . 
5163	br-j56	16	46	125962	The old Morse system was replaced locally by the Simplex modern automatic method in 1929 , when Ellamae_Heckman ( Wilcox ) was manager of the Western_Union office . 
5164	br-j56	16	47	125990	During summers , business was so brisk that Mrs._Wilcox had two assistants and a messenger . 
5165	br-j56	16	48	126006	She was succeeded by Clarence_Goyette . 
5166	br-j56	16	49	126012	Since that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad_station at the Depot and shops at the Center back to the town_clerk 's office and drugstore at the Village . 
5167	br-j56	16	50	126045	After being located for some years in the Village at the Equinox_Pharmacy under the supervision of Mrs._Harry_Mercier , it is presently located in the Hill_and_Dale_Shop , Manchester_Center . 
5168	br-j56	17	51	126073	The first known telephone_line in Manchester was established in July 1883 between Burr and Manley 's store at Manchester_Depot and the Kent_and_Root_Marble_Company in South_Dorset . 
5169	br-j56	17	52	126098	This was extended the following year to include the railroad_station agent 's office and Thayer 's Hotel at Factory_Point . 
5170	br-j56	17	53	126118	In November 1887 a line connecting several dwelling_houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester_Depot . 
5171	br-j56	17	54	126133	Telephone_wires from Louis_Dufresne 's house in East_Manchester to the Dufresne lumber job near Bourn_Pond were up about 1895 . 
5172	br-j56	17	55	126152	Eber_L._Taylor of Manchester_Depot recorded the setting of phone poles in East_Dorset and Barnumville in his diary for 1906 . 
5173	br-j56	17	56	126171	These must have been for local_calls strictly , as in May 1900 the `` only long distance telephone '' in town was transferred from C._B._Carleton 's to Young 's shoe_store . 
5174	br-j56	18	57	126202	A small single switchboard was installed in the Village over Woodcock 's hardware_store ( later E._H._Hemenway 's ) . 
5175	br-j56	18	58	126221	George_Woodcock was manager and troubleshooter ; Elizabeth_Way was the first operator ; and a night operator was also employed . 
5176	br-j56	18	59	126241	Anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones advertised the fact along with the telephone_number in the Manchester_Journal . 
5177	br-j56	19	60	126262	In 1918 the New_England_Telephone_Company began erecting a building to house its operations on the corner of U._S._Rte._7 and what is now Memorial_Avenue at Manchester_Center . 
5178	br-j56	19	61	126287	Service running through Barnumville and to Bennington_County towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the `` Gleason_Telephone_Company '' in 1925 , but major supervision of telephone_lines in Manchester was with the New_England_Telephone_and_Telegraph_Company , which eventually gained all control . 
5179	br-j56	19	62	126329	More aerial and underground equipment was installed as_well as office improvements to take_care of the expanding business . 
5180	br-j56	20	63	126347	In 1931 Mrs._F._H._Briggs , agent and chief operator , who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years ' service , led agency offices in sales for the year with $ 2490 . 
5181	br-j56	20	64	126380	William_Hitchcock , who retired in 1938 , was a veteran of thirty-four years ' local service . 
5182	br-j56	20	65	126397	Another veteran telephone_operator was Edith_Fleming_Blackmer , who had been in the office forty years at the time of her death in 1960 . 
5183	br-j56	21	66	126420	In 1932 Dorset received its own exchange , which made business easier for the Manchester office , but it was not until February 1953 that area service was extended to include Manchester and Dorset . 
5184	br-j56	21	67	126455	This eliminated toll_calls between the two towns . 
5185	br-j56	21	68	126463	Within a month , calls were up seventy per_cent . 
5186	br-j56	22	69	126473	Electricity plays such an important part in community life today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not available for daily use . 
5187	br-j56	22	70	126500	Yet one has to go_back only some sixty years . 
5188	br-j56	23	71	126510	The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems to be one installed in Reuben_Colvin 's and Houghton 's gristmill on the West_Branch in Factory_Point . 
5189	br-j56	23	72	126537	No records are available as_to the date or extent of installation , but it may have been in 1896 . 
5190	br-j56	24	73	126557	On June_14 , 1900 the Manchester_Journal reported that an electrical_engineer was installing an electric_light plant for Edward_S._Isham at `` Ormsby_Hill '' . 
5191	br-j56	24	74	126579	This was working by the end of August and giving satisfactory service . 
5192	br-j56	25	75	126592	In November 1900 surveying was done under John_Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power_plant . 
5193	br-j56	25	76	126623	Nothing came of it , perhaps due_to lack of opportunity for water storage . 
5194	br-j56	26	77	126637	The next step was construction by the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company of a plant on the west bank of the Battenkill south of Union_Street bridge . 
5195	br-j56	26	78	126660	This was nearly completed May 23 , 1901 with a promise of lights by June 10 , but the first light did not go_on until September 28 . 
5196	br-j56	26	79	126688	It was at the end of the sidewalk in_front of the Dellwood_Cemetery cottage . 
5197	br-j56	27	80	126702	The first directors of the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company were John_Marsden , M._L._Manley , William_F._Orvis , George_Smith , and John_Blackmer . 
5198	br-j56	27	81	126720	The officers were John_Marsden , president ; John_C._Blackmer , vice-president ; George_Smith , treasurer ; and William_F._Orvis , secretary . 
5199	br-j56	27	82	126740	Marsden was manager of the company for ten years and manager of its successor company , the Colonial_Light_and_Power_Company , for one year . 
5200	br-j56	28	83	126763	At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under_way , the Vail_Light_and_Lumber_Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present Bennington_Co-operative_Creamery , intending to use its surplus power for generating electricity . 
5201	br-j56	28	84	126801	Manchester then had two competing power_companies until 1904 , when the Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company purchased the transmission system of the Vail_Company . 
5202	br-j56	28	85	126821	This was fortunate , as the Vail plant burned in 1905 . 
5203	br-j56	29	86	126833	The Colonial_Light_and_Power_Company was succeeded by the Vermont_Hydro-Electric_Corporation , which in_turn was absorbed by the Central_Vermont_Public_Service_Corporation . 
5204	br-j56	29	87	126849	The latter now furnishes the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at Manchester_Depot which was put into operation February 19 , 1930 and was improved in January 1942 by the installation of larger transformers . 
5205	br-j56	30	88	126886	For a time following the abandonment of the local plant , electric_current for Manchester was brought_in from the south with an emergency tie-in with the Vermont_Marble_Company system to_the_north . 
5206	br-j57	1	1	126915	Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high_spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' . 
5207	br-j57	1	2	126969	With_respect_to this view , two points are worth making . 
5208	br-j57	1	3	126979	First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title_page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . 
5209	br-j57	1	4	127005	It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' . 
5210	br-j57	1	5	127031	It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in More 's lexicon , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn . 
5211	br-j57	1	6	127071	More believed that a man could be both serious and gay . 
5212	br-j57	1	7	127083	That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all_too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of . 
5213	br-j57	1	8	127136	Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More 's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself . 
5214	br-j57	1	9	127202	Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ_Church and Regius_Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance_English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent . 
5215	br-j57	2	10	127249	But to return to the main line of our inquiry . 
5216	br-j57	2	11	127260	It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr . 
5217	br-j57	2	12	127306	Utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense More stood on the margin of modernity . 
5218	br-j57	2	13	127321	And if he did stand on the margins of modernity , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom . 
5219	br-j57	2	14	127354	It was not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus 's philological study of the New_Testament . 
5220	br-j57	2	15	127405	Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century . 
5221	br-j57	2	16	127426	Had More 's writings been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or_so other authors living in his time , whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works . 
5222	br-j57	3	17	127483	More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone - because he wrote Utopia . 
5223	br-j57	3	18	127500	And the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or_so . 
5224	br-j57	3	19	127534	Only one other contemporary of More 's evokes so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work - Niccolo_Machiavelli and The_Prince . 
5225	br-j57	3	20	127560	Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response ? 
5226	br-j57	3	21	127574	Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern . 
5227	br-j57	3	22	127625	The medieval was the most important to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas_More , the author of Utopia , in some intelligible relation with St._Thomas_More , the martyr . 
5228	br-j57	3	23	127655	To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of Christian_Humanism , the Renaissance elements are of primary concern . 
5229	br-j57	3	24	127676	But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation ; we want to know why that book has kept_on selling the way it has ; we want_to know what is perennially new about Utopia . 
5230	br-j57	4	25	127710	What is new about it ? 
5231	br-j57	4	26	127716	To that question the answer is simple ; it can be made in two words , Utopian communism . 
5232	br-j57	4	27	127735	But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials . 
5233	br-j57	4	28	127753	Surely there is nothing new about communism . 
5234	br-j57	4	29	127761	We find it in Plato 's republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book . 
5235	br-j57	4	30	127780	We find it in that `` common way_of_life pleasing to Christ and still in_use among the truest societies of Christians '' , that_is , the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity . 
5236	br-j57	4	31	127818	We find it in the later Stoic conception of man 's natural condition which included the community of all possessions . 
5237	br-j57	4	32	127839	This conception was taken_up by the early Church_Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle_Ages ; and More was far too well_read not to have come_across it in one or several of the forms thus given it . 
5238	br-j57	5	33	127879	But although the idea of communism is very old even in More 's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as_such that we are concerned with . 
5239	br-j57	5	34	127915	We are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus : 
5240	br-j57	5	35	127931	Platonic , Stoic , early Christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; we are concerned with Utopian communism - that_is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia , as More conceived it . 
5241	br-j57	5	36	127971	Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of communistic theory . 
5242	br-j57	5	37	127997	We will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not . 
5243	br-j57	6	38	128015	In Plato 's Republic communism is - to speak anachronistically - a communism of Janissaries . 
5244	br-j57	6	39	128031	Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevails , the governing warrior elite . 
5245	br-j57	6	40	128053	Moreover , it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus to Plato 's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods , wives , and children , was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche ; and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns . 
5246	br-j57	6	41	128120	In More 's Utopia communism is not a means of separating_out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass . 
5247	br-j57	6	42	128139	Utopian communism applies to all Utopians . 
5248	br-j57	6	43	128146	And in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central . 
5249	br-j57	6	44	128160	The concern of Utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering of a civil society ; and it is again_and_again made clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensable to that best ordering . 
5250	br-j57	7	45	128198	To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors in spirit , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift of adjectives , misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato 's Republic : 
5251	br-j57	7	46	128245	in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes . 
5252	br-j57	7	47	128276	The apostolic community was literally an elite : chosen by Christ himself . 
5253	br-j57	7	48	128289	And the monastic communities were supposed to be made_up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors , their spiritual athleticism . 
5254	br-j57	8	49	128319	Finally , the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More 's time , although it was not accepted by all the theologian philosophers of the Middle_Ages . 
5255	br-j57	8	50	128360	In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the Fall of Man . 
5256	br-j57	8	51	128380	It did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had sinned . 
5257	br-j57	8	52	128412	The actual function of patristic civilian canonist scholastic communism was adequately set_forth by St._Gregory almost a millennium before More wrote Utopia . 
5258	br-j57	9	53	128434	`` The soil is common to all men . 
5259	br-j57	9	54	128443	When we give the necessities of life to the poor , we restore to them what is already theirs . 
5260	br-j57	9	55	128463	We should think_of it more as an act of justice than compassion '' . 
5261	br-j57	10	56	128477	Because community not severalty of property is the law_of_nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his . 
5262	br-j57	10	57	128499	Indeed , of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian . 
5263	br-j57	10	58	128525	He is a trustee for the common good , however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund , wisely or unwisely , entrusted to his keeping . 
5264	br-j57	10	59	128567	In_contrast_to this Stoic patristic view , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely_on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve . 
5265	br-j57	10	60	128608	The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions . 
5266	br-j57	10	61	128616	In a properly ordered society the massive force of public_law performs the function which in natural_law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small_voice so often still . 
5267	br-j57	11	62	128644	In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role . 
5268	br-j57	11	63	128667	Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced . 
5269	br-j57	11	64	128684	We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk_lore of the Greeks . 
5270	br-j57	11	65	128709	In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original - a new thing . 
5271	br-j57	11	66	128741	It is not merely a new thing ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; most_of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism . 
5272	br-j57	11	67	128778	But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin_Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine 's encounter with man . 
5273	br-j57	11	68	128835	New , indeed , is Luther 's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at . 
5274	br-j57	12	69	128867	Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in_theory or in_practice . 
5275	br-j57	12	70	128900	Consider the features of Utopian communism : 
5276	br-j57	12	71	128907	generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; even houses changed once a decade ; six hours of manual_labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private_property , no money ; no sort of pricing at_all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term . 
5277	br-j57	12	72	129002	Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist . 
5278	br-j57	12	73	129028	It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details . 
5279	br-j57	12	74	129055	What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history , the one which reached Christianity by_the_way_of Stoicism through the Church_Fathers of Late Antiquity . 
5280	br-j58	1	1	129097	During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration_of_Independence . 
5281	br-j58	1	2	129120	During the Brown trial , however , the state 's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence_Daily_Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not_only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal_governments . 
5282	br-j58	1	3	129182	The Providence_Daily_Journal answered the Daily_Post by stating that the raid of John_Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican_Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' . 
5283	br-j58	1	4	129234	The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history . 
5284	br-j58	2	5	129260	While the Daily_Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily_Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket_Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men . 
5285	br-j58	2	6	129294	Editor_Foss stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no_doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' . 
5286	br-j58	2	7	129323	The Providence_Daily_Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings . 
5287	br-j58	2	8	129356	The Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace . 
5288	br-j58	3	9	129381	On October 31 , 1859 , John_Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder . 
5289	br-j58	3	10	129406	For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in_public on Friday , December 2 , 1859 . 
5290	br-j58	3	11	129424	Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia . 
5291	br-j58	4	12	129448	Although Rhode_Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John_Brown 's trial with extreme interest . 
5292	br-j58	4	13	129466	On Wednesday morning , November_2 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial . 
5293	br-j58	4	14	129502	The editor 's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted . 
5294	br-j58	4	15	129519	The readers of the Providence_Daily_Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old_Brown '' had a fair trial . 
5295	br-j58	4	16	129542	Concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws , organized treason , and butchered her citizens '' . 
5296	br-j58	5	17	129575	In the eastern section of the state the newspapers ' reaction to Brown 's trial and sentence were basically identical . 
5297	br-j58	5	18	129596	J._Wheaton_Smith , editor of the Warren_Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in_order_that all those misnamed philantropists [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . 
5298	br-j58	5	19	129658	The editor of the Newport_Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment . 
5299	br-j58	6	20	129686	In direct_contrast to the other Rhode_Island editors , Samuel_S._Foss of the Woonsocket_Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair . 
5300	br-j58	6	21	129707	Concerning the sentence , Foss wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John_Brown 's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment , it would be well - well for the country and for Virginia '' . 
5301	br-j58	7	22	129749	Despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of John_Brown , Rhode_Islanders turned their attention to the state elections . 
5302	br-j58	7	23	129771	The state had elected Republican candidates in the past two years . 
5303	br-j58	7	24	129783	There was no_doubt as_to the control the Republican_party exercised throughout the state . 
5304	br-j58	7	25	129796	If it failed on_occasion to elect its candidates for general state offices by majorities , the failure was due_to a lingering remnant of the Know-Nothing party , which called itself the American Republican_party . 
5305	br-j58	7	26	129830	The American_Republicans and the Republicans both nominated lieutenant-governor Turner for governor . 
5306	br-j58	7	27	129842	Elisha_R._Potter was the Democratic candidate . 
5307	br-j58	7	28	129848	The results of the election of 1859 found Republican candidates not_only winning the offices of governor and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining the two Congressional offices from the eastern and western sections of the state . 
5308	br-j58	8	29	129883	During the month of November hardly_a day passed when there was not some mention of John_Brown in the Rhode_Island newspapers . 
5309	br-j58	8	30	129904	On November 7 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal reprinted a letter sent to John_Brown from `` E._B. '' , a Quaker lady in Newport . 
5310	br-j58	8	31	129929	In reference_to Brown 's raid she wrote , `` though we are non-resistants and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal weapons we know thee was anemated [ sic ] by the most generous and philanthropic motives '' . 
5311	br-j58	8	32	129973	`` E._B. '' compared John_Brown to Moses in_that they were both acting to deliver millions from oppression . 
5312	br-j58	8	33	129991	In contrast to `` E._B. '' , most Rhode_Islanders hardly thought_of John_Brown as being another Moses . 
5313	br-j58	8	34	130008	Most attempts to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an unresponsive audience in Rhode_Island . 
5314	br-j58	9	35	130026	On Wednesday evening , November 23 , 1859 , in Warren , Rev._Mark_Trafton of New_Bedford , gave a `` Mission_of_Sympathy '' lecture in which he favorably viewed the Harper_'s_Ferry insurrection . 
5315	br-j58	9	36	130057	The Warren_Telegraph stated that many of Rev._Trafton 's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism . 
5316	br-j58	9	37	130076	In its account of the Trafton lecture , the Providence_Daily_Post said that the remarks of Rev._Trafton made the people indignant . 
5317	br-j58	10	38	130097	No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence_Daily_Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state_prison who were a_thousand times more deserving of sympathy . 
5318	br-j58	10	39	130133	The Providence_Daily_Journal , however , stated that Brown 's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one '' . 
5319	br-j58	10	40	130172	The Woonsocket_Patriot admitted that John_Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no_more be hung than Henry_A._Wise or James_Buchanan '' . 
5320	br-j58	10	41	130195	The Newport_Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him . 
5321	br-j58	11	42	130222	In her letter to John_Brown , `` E._B. '' , the Quakeress from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John_Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George_Washington . 
5322	br-j58	11	43	130260	During the latter days of November to the day of Brown 's execution , it seems that most Rhode_Islanders did not concur in `` E._B. 's '' suggestion . 
5323	br-j58	11	44	130289	On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence_Daily_Journal stated that although Brown 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions . 
5324	br-j58	11	45	130327	A week later the Daily_Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John_Brown on the day of his execution . 
5325	br-j58	11	46	130354	The editor of the Daily_Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak_for Providence '' . 
5326	br-j58	11	47	130395	The Providence_Daily_Post 's editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence . 
5327	br-j58	11	48	130417	He further called_upon the people of Providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace . 
5328	br-j58	12	49	130432	On December 2 , 1859 , John_Brown was hanged at Charles_Town , Virginia . 
5329	br-j58	12	50	130446	Extraordinary precautions were taken so that no stranger be allowed_in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surrounding the scaffold . 
5330	br-j58	12	51	130468	In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church_bells were tolled . 
5331	br-j58	12	52	130482	Such was not the case in Rhode_Island . 
5332	br-j58	12	53	130490	The only public demonstration in honor of John_Brown was held at Pratt_'s_Hall in Providence , on the day of his execution . 
5333	br-j58	13	54	130512	Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt_Hall meeting `` brought_together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many_of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' . 
5334	br-j58	13	55	130575	Seated on the platform were Amos_C._Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; Thomas_Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; the Reverend_Augustus_Woodbury , a Unitarian minister ; the Reverend_George_T._Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; Daniel_w._Vaughan , and William_H._H._Clements . 
5335	br-j58	13	56	130617	The latter two were appointed secretaries . 
5336	br-j58	13	57	130624	The first speaker was Amos_C._Barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting . 
5337	br-j58	13	58	130639	He spoke of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared John_Brown of Harper_'s_Ferry to the John_Brown of Rhode_Island 's colonial period . 
5338	br-j58	13	59	130668	Barstow concluded that as Rhode_Island 's John_Brown became a canonized hero , if not a saint , so would it be with John_Brown of Harper_'s_Ferry . 
5339	br-j58	14	60	130694	The next speaker was George_T._Day . 
5340	br-j58	14	61	130700	Although admitting Brown 's guilt on legal grounds , Day said that , `` Brown is no common criminal ; his deed was not below , but above the law '' . 
5341	br-j58	14	62	130732	Following Day was Woodbury who spoke of his disapproval of Brown 's attempt at servile insurrection , his admiration of Brown 's character , and his opposition to slavery . 
5342	br-j58	14	63	130762	Woodbury 's remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times and once there was hissing . 
5343	br-j58	15	64	130781	The fourth and last speaker was Thomas_Davis . 
5344	br-j58	15	65	130789	By this time large_numbers of the audience had left the hall . 
5345	br-j58	15	66	130801	Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city . 
5346	br-j58	15	67	130832	He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments . 
5347	br-j58	15	68	130863	In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took_part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned '' . 
5348	br-j58	15	69	130907	He recalled that in Rhode_Island a party opposed to the state 's condemnation of a man ( Thomas_W._Dorr ) proclaimed the state 's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty . 
5349	br-j58	15	70	130947	At the close of Davis ' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously : 
5350	br-j58	16	71	130975	Whereas , John_Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper : 
5351	br-j58	16	72	131013	Therefore , 
5352	br-j58	17	73	131015	Resolved that , while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor . 
5353	br-j58	18	74	131077	Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent_on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call_for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice . 
5354	br-j58	19	75	131144	Resolved that the anti slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action . 
5355	br-j58	20	76	131157	Resolved , that we find in this fearful tragedy at Harper_'s_Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible . 
5356	br-j58	21	77	131189	On the morning following the Pratt_Hall meeting the editor of the Providence_Daily_Journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes , it could have been avoided completely . 
5357	br-j59	1	1	131228	Rather than being deceived , the eye is puzzled ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than - a picture . 
5358	br-j59	2	2	131254	Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's_length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances . 
5359	br-j59	2	3	131294	To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; the granular texture thus created likewise called_attention_to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas . 
5360	br-j59	2	4	131341	In certain other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . 
5361	br-j59	2	5	131362	These areas by_virtue_of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued - and set to shuttling again - only by conventional perspective ; that_is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface . 
5362	br-j59	3	6	131439	The accumulation of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth . 
5363	br-j59	3	7	131462	The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in_order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion . 
5364	br-j59	3	8	131489	It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint . 
5365	br-j59	3	9	131539	Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . 
5366	br-j59	3	10	131571	It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque 's , which would confirm the date he assigns it . 
5367	br-j59	3	11	131594	But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as_well_as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 . 
5368	br-j59	4	12	131639	When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each . 
5369	br-j59	4	13	131661	( It makes no real difference that Braque 's collage is on_paper and eked_out in charcoal , while Picasso 's is on canvas and eked_out in oil . ) 
5370	br-j59	4	14	131690	By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done . 
5371	br-j59	4	15	131732	But here again , the surface declaring device both overshoots and falls_short_of its aim . 
5372	br-j59	4	16	131747	For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives_way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief , which gives_way in_turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seems to contain both - or neither . 
5373	br-j59	5	17	131794	Because of the size of the areas it covers , the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily , as more than an indication or sign . 
5374	br-j59	5	18	131820	Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerangs : the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before . 
5375	br-j59	5	19	131852	Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it , the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as_well_as start his picture . 
5376	br-j59	5	20	131895	The actual surface becomes both ground and background , and it turns_out - suddenly and paradoxically - that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in_front of , upon , the surface . 
5377	br-j59	5	21	131930	In their very first collages , Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain_of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust_out into real , bas-relief space - or to be about to do so - while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in , or flat upon , the surface . 
5378	br-j59	5	22	131996	And the surface is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast . 
5379	br-j59	6	23	132013	In the upper center of Braque 's first collage , Fruit_Dish ( in Douglas_Cooper 's collection ) , a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture_plane . 
5380	br-j59	6	24	132052	The trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no_longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses , but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing_paper and establish depth on top of_it . 
5381	br-j59	6	25	132080	Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block_capitals that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture_plane so that it does not `` jump '' . 
5382	br-j59	6	26	132127	At_the_same_time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them , and by their placing in_relation_to the block_capitals ; and these capitals seem in_turn to be pushed_back by their placing , and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining . 
5383	br-j59	6	27	132180	Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every_other part and plane ; and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface . 
5384	br-j59	6	28	132230	And the same thing , more_or_less , can be said of the contents of Picasso 's first collage . 
5385	br-j59	7	29	132249	In later collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in_conjunction_with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think_of . 
5386	br-j59	7	30	132284	The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material - or simply of a painted in form - will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth . 
5387	br-j59	7	31	132341	Planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially . 
5388	br-j59	7	32	132370	All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so_as to encompass fictive space in_front of the surface as_well_as behind it . 
5389	br-j59	7	33	132392	Flatness may now monopolize everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn_into illusion itself - at_least an optical if_not , properly_speaking , a pictorial illusion . 
5390	br-j59	7	34	132425	Depicted , Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal , undepicted kind , but at_the_same_time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind - and it does so , moreover , without depriving the latter of its literalness ; rather , it underpins and reinforces that literalness , re-creates it . 
5391	br-j59	8	35	132480	Out of_this re-created literalness , the Cubist subject reemerged . 
5392	br-j59	8	36	132490	For it had turned_out , by a further paradox of Cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging . 
5393	br-j59	8	37	132525	In the Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not_only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in_order to preserve it ; they had also had to generalize it - to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as_such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself . 
5394	br-j59	8	38	132601	In_order to be saved , plasticity had had to be isolated ; and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more_or_less interchangeable and contour obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method , the subject itself became largely unrecognizable . 
5395	br-j59	8	39	132649	Cubism , in its 1911 - 1912 phase ( which the_French , with justice , call `` hermetic '' ) was on the verge of abstract_art . 
5396	br-j59	9	40	132676	It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation . 
5397	br-j59	9	41	132699	If they opted_for illusion , it could only be illusion per_se - an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects . 
5398	br-j59	9	42	132733	If , on_the_other_hand , they opted_for representation , it had to be representation per_se - representation as image pure_and_simple , without connotations ( at_least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed . 
5399	br-j59	9	43	132776	It was the collage that made the terms of_this dilemma clear : the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for_the_first_time , mutually_exclusive alternatives . 
5400	br-j59	10	44	132815	In_the_end , Picasso and Braque plumped_for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately . 
5401	br-j59	10	45	132833	( This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality '' . ) 
5402	br-j59	10	46	132850	But the inner , formal_logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shaping their decision . 
5403	br-j59	10	47	132878	When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical_Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane . 
5404	br-j59	10	48	132929	Left in their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut_away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump_out of plane . 
5405	br-j59	10	49	132970	Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to_the_extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) . 
5406	br-j59	10	50	133028	It was because of this chain-reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_objects , or at_least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque 's and Picasso 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . 
5407	br-j59	11	51	133108	Analytical_Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic_Cubism fully begin there . 
5408	br-j59	11	52	133128	Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities . 
5409	br-j59	12	53	133175	Synthetic_Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the_point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it . 
5410	br-j59	12	54	133212	But even before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him . 
5411	br-j59	12	55	133239	It was as though , in_that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all_the_way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality . 
5412	br-j59	12	56	133273	This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in_general ) literally into the literal space in_front of the picture_plane . 
5413	br-j59	13	57	133305	Some time in 1912 , Picasso cut_out and folded a piece_of_paper in the shape of a guitar ; to this he glued and fitted other pieces_of_paper and four taut strings , thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture_plane . 
5414	br-j59	13	58	133359	The affixed elements of collage were extruded , as_it_were , and cut_off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief . 
5415	br-j60	1	1	133381	( Los_Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper . ) 
5416	br-j60	1	2	133392	And without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems cannot be maintained economically , let_alone built from_scratch at today 's prices . 
5417	br-j60	2	3	133415	However , the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever . 
5418	br-j60	2	4	133427	The new interchange among the four Los_Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square_mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller_Center in New_York . 
5419	br-j60	2	5	133468	It is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls `` the highest and best use '' of centrally located urban land . 
5420	br-j60	2	6	133497	As it affects the city 's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services . 
5421	br-j60	2	7	133531	Subways improved land values without taking_away land ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by_a_long_shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed . 
5422	br-j60	2	8	133565	Downtown Los_Angeles is already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking_lot and garage - one of those preposterous `` if '' statistics has already come to pass . 
5423	br-j60	3	9	133594	The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , isolating boundary . 
5424	br-j60	3	10	133619	City planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might . 
5425	br-j60	3	11	133633	Less ambitious freeway plans may be more successful - especially when the roadways and interchanges are raised , allowing_for cross access at many points and providing parking_areas below the ramp . 
5426	br-j60	4	12	133664	Meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central_city some of its industrial dominance . 
5427	br-j60	4	13	133683	In ever greater numbers , factories are locating in the suburbs or in `` industrial_parks '' removed from the city 's political jurisdiction . 
5428	br-j60	4	14	133707	The appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly_line and wants enough land_area to do the entire job on one floor . 
5429	br-j60	4	15	133741	To light industry , the economies of being on one floor are much slighter , but efficiency_engineers usually believe_in them , and manufacturers looking_for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning_to efficiency_engineers . 
5430	br-j60	5	16	133776	This movement of industry away from the central_cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe . 
5431	br-j60	5	17	133796	It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities . 
5432	br-j60	5	18	133816	The big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities - the rubber factories in Akron , Chrysler 's Detroit plants , U._S._Steel 's Pittsburgh works - often began on these sites at_a_time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( piers ) and power ( river ) . 
5433	br-j60	5	19	133878	The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam_turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not_yet blighted . 
5434	br-j60	6	20	133909	The truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in selecting his plant site . 
5435	br-j60	6	21	133926	Until internal_combustion became cheap , he had_to be near a railroad_siding and a trolley_line or an existing large community of lower-class homes . 
5436	br-j60	6	22	133949	The railroad_siding is still important - it is usually , though not always , true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking . 
5437	br-j60	6	23	133974	But anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad . 
5438	br-j60	6	24	134007	And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking_lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush_hour traffic and grille route bus_lines , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory . 
5439	br-j60	7	25	134053	Willow_Run , General_Electric 's enormous installations at Louisville and Syracuse , the Pentagon , Boeing in Seattle , Douglas and Lockheed in Los_Angeles , the new automobile assembly plants everywhere - none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass_rapid_transit . 
5440	br-j60	7	26	134097	They are all suburban plants , relying_on the roads to keep them supplied with workers . 
5441	br-j60	7	27	134113	And wherever the new thruways go_up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry . 
5442	br-j60	7	28	134134	The drive along Massachusetts ' Route_128 , the by-pass which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston , may be a vision of the future . 
5443	br-j60	8	29	134162	The future could be worse . 
5444	br-j60	8	30	134168	The plants along Route_128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New_England rocks and trees . 
5445	br-j60	8	31	134186	They can even be rather grand , like Edward_Land 's monument to the astonishing success of Polaroid . 
5446	br-j60	8	32	134204	But they deny the values of the city - the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the `` melting_pot '' which gave_off so many of the most admirable American qualities . 
5447	br-j60	8	33	134236	They are segregated businesses , combining again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work_force from segregated communities . 
5448	br-j60	8	34	134259	It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts ' Route_128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements , or from the exploitation of patents which grant at_least a partial monopoly . 
5449	br-j60	9	35	134300	While the factories were always the center of the labor_market , they were often on the city 's periphery . 
5450	br-j60	9	36	134320	In spreading the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities . 
5451	br-j60	9	37	134344	Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt 's motel has been relatively painless ; the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every_year . 
5452	br-j60	9	38	134370	What hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing , especially in those cities where public_transit is feeble . 
5453	br-j60	10	39	134393	Some retailing , of_course , always spreads with the population - grocery_stores , drugstores , local haberdasheries and dress_shops , candy_stores and the_like . 
5454	br-j60	10	40	134417	But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the selection would be greatest . 
5455	br-j60	10	41	134460	Department_stores congregated in the `` one_hundred per_cent location '' , where all the transit_lines converged . 
5456	br-j60	10	42	134476	These stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more_and_more dry_goods . 
5457	br-j60	10	43	134511	If the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar_volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put_in the bank . 
5458	br-j60	11	44	134542	In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated . 
5459	br-j60	11	45	134555	No suburban shopping-center branch - not even Hudson 's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store . 
5460	br-j60	11	46	134593	Telephone_orders distort the picture : 
5461	br-j60	11	47	134598	the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather_than a central city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminates city sales_tax . 
5462	br-j60	11	48	134625	The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened . 
5463	br-j60	11	49	134648	Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are . 
5464	br-j60	11	50	134674	In many cases that statement `` We break_even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' would be turned_around if the cost_analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store . 
5465	br-j60	11	51	134710	Fear of the competition - always a great motivating force in the American economy - makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branches . 
5466	br-j60	11	52	134748	The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches . 
5467	br-j60	11	53	134792	Moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act_as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover . 
5468	br-j60	12	54	134821	When all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing . 
5469	br-j60	12	55	134846	Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easier than to the downtown department_store , though both are the same distance from home . 
5470	br-j60	12	56	134890	Indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown . 
5471	br-j60	12	57	134910	Raymond_Vernon reports that residents of East_St._Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St._Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town . 
5472	br-j60	12	58	134957	To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus_Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight_back successfully by building a garage on the lot next_door . 
5473	br-j60	12	59	134993	If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened_away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program . 
5474	br-j60	12	60	135036	And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . 
5475	br-j60	12	61	135077	Today , according_to land economist Homer_Hoyt , shopping_centers and their associated parking_lots cover some 46000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's Central Business_Districts put together . 
5476	br-j60	13	62	135113	The downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gates and across the street , where other department_stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making_up_her_mind . 
5477	br-j60	13	63	135153	If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children 's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too_much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount_business in big-ticket items . 
5478	br-j60	13	64	135200	Department_stores were built_on dry_goods , especially ladies ' fashions , and in this area , in_the_long_run , the suburban branches will be hard_put to compete against downtown . 
5479	br-j60	13	65	135228	If this analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn_out to be what management 's cost_accountants refuse to acknowledge , marginal operations rather_than major factors . 
5480	br-j60	14	66	135255	Historically in America the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered . 
5481	br-j60	14	67	135276	`` How ya gonna keep ' em down on the farm '' ? 
5482	br-j60	14	68	135289	was a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree . 
5483	br-j60	14	69	135303	Though Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious_belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown . 
5484	br-j60	14	70	135330	Only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central_city would be likely to destroy this preference - and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians , is actually upon us . 
5485	br-j60	15	71	135380	In their book American_Skyline , Christopher_Tunnard and Henry_Hope_Reed argue that Franklin_Roosevelt 's New_Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote . 
5486	br-j60	15	72	135416	The first superhighways - New_York 's Henry_Hudson and Chicago 's Lake_Shore , San_Francisco 's Bay_Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania_Turnpike - were built as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression . 
5487	br-j60	15	73	135457	At_the_same_time , Roosevelt 's Federal_Housing_Administration , coupled with Henry_Morgenthau 's cheap-money policy , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes . 
5488	br-j60	15	74	135480	Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U._S. government ; householders who had been unable to pick_up the burden of short-term high interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per_cent , under government aegis . 
5489	br-j70	1	1	135531	In the midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas . 
5490	br-j70	1	2	135550	The high cost of land and a_few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . 
5491	br-j70	2	3	135593	Research at Fayette_, Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg / l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb BOD / day / acre . 
5492	br-j70	2	4	135630	Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds . 
5493	br-j70	2	5	135668	Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . 
5494	br-j70	2	6	135695	Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen / hr / hp . 
5495	br-j70	3	7	135715	O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes . 
5496	br-j70	3	8	135729	They indicated that a 4 - day retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 per_cent BOD reduction . 
5497	br-j70	3	9	135749	Later , Eckenfelder increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per_cent in the summer months . 
5498	br-j70	3	10	135768	It appeared from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as_well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume . 
5499	br-j70	4	11	135805	With the development of the Red_Bridge_Subdivision south of Kansas_City , Missouri , the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage_disposal . 
5500	br-j70	4	12	135829	The sewage_system from Kansas_City was not expected to serve the Red_Bridge area for several years . 
5501	br-j70	4	13	135845	This necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 yrs. . 
5502	br-j70	4	14	135864	For the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1 . 
5503	br-j70	4	15	135879	The oxidation pond has a surface_area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 ft . 
5504	br-j70	4	16	135895	The pond is currently serving 1230 persons or 260 persons per acre . 
5505	br-j70	4	17	135908	In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors . 
5506	br-j70	4	18	135924	It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium_nitrate until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green_algae . 
5507	br-j70	5	19	135953	The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium_nitrate . 
5508	br-j70	5	20	135974	At_the_same_time further expansion in the Red_Bridge_Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities . 
5509	br-j70	5	21	135989	The large land_areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer . 
5510	br-j70	5	22	136007	It was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development . 
5511	br-j70	6	23	136035	The lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating domestic sewage . 
5512	br-j70	6	24	136064	The pilot plant was a circular lagoon 81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom , 4 ft below the surface , with a volume of 121000 gal . 
5513	br-j70	6	25	136100	The side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to prevent erosion . 
5514	br-j70	6	26	136115	The pilot lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area . 
5515	br-j70	6	27	136137	The major contributor was a shopping_center with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed . 
5516	br-j70	6	28	136155	The pilot lagoon was designed to handle the wastes from 314 persons with a 4 - day aeration period . 
5517	br-j70	6	29	136175	Initially , the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping_center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18 - month period . 
5518	br-j70	6	30	136200	This operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant , with a slowly increasing load , over a reasonable period_of_time . 
5519	br-j70	7	31	136221	The pilot plant was equipped with a 3 - hp turbine aerator ( Figure 2 ) . 
5520	br-j70	7	32	136238	The aerator had a variable speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds . 
5521	br-j70	7	33	136254	The sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24 - hr charts . 
5522	br-j70	7	34	136272	The raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents . 
5523	br-j70	7	35	136296	The effluent was collected through two pipes and discharged to the Blue_River through a surface drainage_ditch . 
5524	br-j70	8	36	136313	Composite samples were collected at weekly intervals . 
5525	br-j70	8	37	136321	The long retention period and the complete mixing concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent . 
5526	br-j70	8	38	136343	Weekly samples would make any changes more readily discernible than daily samples . 
5527	br-j70	8	39	136356	The composite samples were normally collected over a 6 - hr period , but an occasional 24 - hr composite was made . 
5528	br-j70	8	40	136379	Examination of the operations of the shopping_center permitted correlation of the 6 - hr composite samples with 24 - hr operations . 
5529	br-j70	8	41	136401	The data indicated that the organic load during the 6 - hr composites was essentially 50 per_cent of the 24 - hr organic load . 
5530	br-j70	9	42	136426	Grab_samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions . 
5531	br-j70	9	43	136440	Efforts were made to take the grab_samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6 - hr composite sample . 
5532	br-j70	9	44	136467	A single 24 - hr composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical . 
5533	br-j70	10	45	136485	The BOD of the influent to the pilot plant varied between 110 and 710 mg / l with an average of 350 mg / l . 
5534	br-j70	10	46	136511	This was equivalent_to 240 mg / l BOD on a 24 - hr basis . 
5535	br-j70	10	47	136526	The BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision . 
5536	br-j70	10	48	136541	The BOD in the effluent averaged 58 mg / l , a 76 - per_cent reduction over the 24 - hr period . 
5537	br-j70	10	49	136564	Examination of the data in Table 1 , shows that a_few samples contributed to raising the effluent BOD . 
5538	br-j70	10	50	136583	The periods of high effluent BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted . 
5539	br-j70	10	51	136601	Ice caused the aerator to overload , straining the drive belts . 
5540	br-j70	10	52	136613	The slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow_down and reduce oxygen transfer as_well_as the mixing of the raw sewage . 
5541	br-j70	11	53	136636	The organic loading on the unit averaged 32 lb of BOD / day or about 2 lb BOD / day 1000 cu_ft aeration capacity . 
5542	br-j70	11	54	136661	Needless to say , the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis , but was 270 lb BOD / day / acre on a surface loading basis . 
5543	br-j70	11	55	136691	It seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system . 
5544	br-j70	12	56	136712	The flow_rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table 1 , . 
5545	br-j70	12	57	136728	With the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due_to infiltration in open sewers . 
5546	br-j70	12	58	136742	As construction progresses , the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced . 
5547	br-j70	12	59	136756	The retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged from 9.8 to 2.6 days , averaging 6.4 days . 
5548	br-j70	13	60	136774	The large amount of vegetable grindings from the grocery_store in the shopping_center created a suspended solids problem . 
5549	br-j70	13	61	136792	The vegetables were not readily metabolized by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on the surface . 
5550	br-j70	13	62	136813	A skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of most of these light solids . 
5551	br-j70	13	63	136829	The average volatile suspended solids in the effluent was 75 mg / l while MLSS averaged 170 mg / l volatile suspended solids . 
5552	br-j70	13	64	136853	The average sludge age based on displacement of solids was calculated to be 14.5 days . 
5553	br-j70	13	65	136869	The oxygen uptake rate in the mixed liquor averaged 0.8 mg / l / hr during the first four months of this study . 
5554	br-j70	13	66	136893	Variations in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand . 
5555	br-j70	13	67	136913	The increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1.2 to 2.6 mg / l / hr which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds . 
5556	br-j70	13	68	136953	It appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active microbial solids with the heavier , less active solids settling out . 
5557	br-j70	14	69	136977	The suspended solids discharged in the effluent were found to be the major source of the BOD . 
5558	br-j70	14	70	136995	Removal of the suspended solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing only 20 mg / l BOD . 
5559	br-j70	14	71	137016	The BOD in the drainage_ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 mg / l . 
5560	br-j70	14	72	137032	This low BOD was_due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during this study . 
5561	br-j70	15	73	137060	Routine microscopic examinations were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by McKinney and Gram for the various types of protozoa . 
5562	br-j70	15	74	137082	It was found that the aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather_than an oxidation pond . 
5563	br-j70	15	75	137099	At no time were algae found in the mixed liquor . 
5564	br-j70	15	76	137110	The bacteria formed typical activated sludge floc . 
5565	br-j70	15	77	137118	The floc particles were all small as the heavier floc settled out . 
5566	br-j70	16	78	137131	Initially , the flagellated_protozoa predominated , but they soon gave_way to the free_swimming ciliated_protozoa . 
5567	br-j70	16	79	137146	As the temperature decreased , the number of free_swimming ciliated_protozoa decreased . 
5568	br-j70	16	80	137158	Very little protozoa activity existed below 40 ` F . 
5569	br-j70	16	81	137168	When the temperature reached 32 ` F all protozoan activity ceased ; but as the temperature rose , the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly . 
5570	br-j70	16	82	137193	Only once were stalked ciliates found in the mixed liquor . 
5571	br-j70	16	83	137204	The predomination of free_swimming ciliated_protozoa is indicative_of a high bacterial population . 
5572	br-j70	17	84	137216	One of the important aspects of_this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator . 
5573	br-j70	17	85	137235	Routine determinations were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates . 
5574	br-j70	17	86	137252	The data given in Table 2 , show the routine operation of the aerator . 
5575	br-j70	17	87	137267	The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29 , 1961 . 
5576	br-j70	17	88	137283	An extended cold_spell caused ice to build_up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water . 
5577	br-j70	17	89	137312	The added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity . 
5578	br-j70	17	90	137329	It was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected , but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen . 
5579	br-j70	18	91	137355	A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate . 
5580	br-j70	18	92	137374	Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover . 
5581	br-j70	18	93	137390	The rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 - mg / l dissolved oxygen concentration and 10 ` C for various rotor speeds is given in Table 3 , . 
5582	br-j70	18	94	137419	The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 mg / l dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lb / day at a maximum rate of 9.3 mg / l / hr . 
5583	br-j70	18	95	137451	The actual power requirements indicated 2 lb oxygen transfer / hr / hp . 
5584	br-j70	18	96	137465	The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per_cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather_than through the surface . 
5585	br-j70	19	97	137492	During this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted . 
5586	br-j70	19	98	137510	Shortly after this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium_nitrate . 
5587	br-j70	19	99	137525	The location of the oxidation pond in a high value residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer . 
5588	br-j70	19	100	137547	The organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from 160 to 270 mg / l of BOD with an average of 230 mg / l . 
5589	br-j70	19	101	137574	The BOD data are given in Table 4 , . 
5590	br-j70	19	102	137584	A single 24 - hr composite sample had a BOD of 260 mg / l , indicating a typical domestic sewage . 
5591	br-j70	19	103	137606	The daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged 147000 gpd , giving a retention period of 42 days . 
5592	br-j70	19	104	137626	The organic loading on the pond was slightly under 60 lb BOD / day / acre . 
5593	br-j70	20	105	137643	The effluent BOD averaged 34 mg / l , a_little lower than that of the study at Fayette indicated for a loading of 60 lb BOD / day / acre . 
5594	br-j70	20	106	137674	The BOD of the effluent ranged from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47 mg / l . 
5595	br-j70	20	107	137694	Microscopic examination of the effluent showed that minimum BOD occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold_weather . 
5596	br-j70	20	108	137713	When the algae began to build_up again , the effluent BOD rose . 
5597	br-j70	20	109	137726	During the two_weeks when the algae disappeared from the effluent BOD 's in the effluent were 18 and 16 mg / l . 
5598	br-k01	1	1	137749	Scotty did not go_back to school . 
5599	br-k01	1	2	137756	His parents talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University_Hospital - Mr._McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family - and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off , spend a_lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty_much as he chose - provided , of_course , he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating . 
5600	br-k01	1	3	137838	His teacher and his school_principal were conferred_with and everyone agreed that , if he kept_up with a certain amount of work at home , there was little danger of his losing a term . 
5601	br-k01	2	4	137872	Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments . 
5602	br-k01	3	5	137885	He was discharged from the hospital after a two day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr._McKinley described as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus . 
5603	br-k01	3	6	137918	Rachel wore a smart hat and , because she had been warned recently about smoking , puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick . 
5604	br-k01	3	7	137947	Scotty 's father sat sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a cricket , looking about at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression of proprietorship . 
5605	br-k01	4	8	137979	Teachers - men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles - came to their table to talk_shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel . 
5606	br-k01	4	9	138009	Rachel was polite , Scotty indifferent . 
5607	br-k01	4	10	138016	They ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces and Scotty gazed without interest at his food , the teachers , the heroic baronial windows , and the bright ranks of college banners . 
5608	br-k01	4	11	138050	His father tried to make the food a topic . 
5609	br-k01	5	12	138060	`` The blueberry_pie is good , Scotty . 
5610	br-k01	5	13	138068	I recommend it '' . 
5611	br-k01	5	14	138073	He looked at his son , his face worried . 
5612	br-k01	5	15	138083	Scotty murmured , `` No , thanks '' , so softly his father had_to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him . 
5613	br-k01	5	16	138113	Scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment of interest . 
5614	br-k01	5	17	138129	He said more loudly , `` I'm full , old Pop '' . 
5615	br-k01	5	18	138142	He had eaten almost nothing on the crested , three sectioned plate and had drunk about half the milk in its paper container . 
5616	br-k01	6	19	138166	`` He's all_right , Craig '' , Rachel said . 
5617	br-k01	6	20	138176	`` I can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home '' . 
5618	br-k01	7	21	138192	Since his seizure , Scotty had had little appetite ; yet his changed appearance , surprisingly , was one of plumpness . 
5619	br-k01	7	22	138214	His face was fuller ; his lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen looking . 
5620	br-k01	7	23	138234	He breathed now with his mouth open , showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth ; he kept his eyes , with their puffed blurred lids , always lowered , though not , apparently , focusing . 
5621	br-k01	7	24	138272	Even his neck seemed thicker and therefore shorter . 
5622	br-k01	7	25	138281	His hands , which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering birds , were now neither active nor really relaxed . 
5623	br-k01	7	26	138304	They lay on his lap , palms up , stiffly motionless , the tapered fingers a_little thick at the joints . 
5624	br-k01	7	27	138325	Altogether he had , since the seizure , the appearance of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise . 
5625	br-k01	7	28	138347	He looked lazy , spoiled , a_little querulous . 
5626	br-k01	8	29	138356	Rachel had little to say . 
5627	br-k01	8	30	138362	She greeted her husband 's colleagues with smiling politeness , offering nothing . 
5628	br-k01	8	31	138375	Mr._McKinley , for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity , was completely alert to his son , eyes always on the still face , jumping to anticipate Scotty_'s desires . 
5629	br-k01	8	32	138406	It was a strained , silent lunch . 
5630	br-k01	9	33	138414	Rachel said , `` I 'd_better get him to bed '' . 
5631	br-k01	10	34	138426	The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger . 
5632	br-k01	11	35	138443	Since Mr._McKinley had to give a lecture , Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth . 
5633	br-k01	11	36	138461	They did not speak much . 
5634	br-k01	11	37	138467	Scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and said softly , `` Look at those stupid kids '' . 
5635	br-k01	11	38	138486	It was a Negro section of peeling row_houses , store-front churches and ragged children . 
5636	br-k01	11	39	138501	Rachel had to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat . 
5637	br-k01	11	40	138513	He said , `` Nothing '' . 
5638	br-k01	11	41	138520	And_then : `` There are lots of kids around here '' . 
5639	br-k01	12	42	138532	Scotty looked at the children , his mouth slightly opened , his eyes dull . 
5640	br-k01	12	43	138547	He felt tired and full and calm . 
5641	br-k01	13	44	138555	The days seemed short , perhaps because his routine was , each_day , almost the same . 
5642	br-k01	13	45	138572	He rose late and went_down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel . 
5643	br-k01	13	46	138591	Virginia treated him with_attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food : biscuits , cookies , candies - the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen . 
5644	br-k01	13	47	138621	She would hover over him and , looking_like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of Scotty 's fork or spoon . 
5645	br-k01	14	48	138643	`` You do n't eat enough , honey . 
5646	br-k01	14	49	138652	Try to get that down '' . 
5647	br-k01	15	50	138659	Rachel , observing , would say , `` He has_to rediscover his own capacity . 
5648	br-k01	15	51	138674	It 'll take time '' . 
5649	br-k01	16	52	138680	Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly now , as allies who are political rather_than natural might in a war atmosphere . 
5650	br-k01	16	53	138703	Both watched Scotty constantly , Rachel without seeming to , Virginia openly , her eyes filled with concern . 
5651	br-k01	16	54	138722	Scotty was neutral . 
5652	br-k01	16	55	138726	He did not resent their supervision or Virginia 's sometimes tiring sympathy . 
5653	br-k01	16	56	138739	He ate what he felt_like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the draughty rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow dubious steps , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral . 
5654	br-k01	16	57	138785	His energy was gone . 
5655	br-k01	16	58	138790	He was able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living_room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving . 
5656	br-k01	16	59	138816	His hands lay loosely , yet stiffly - they were like wax hands : almost lifelike , not quite - folded in his lap ; his mouth hung slightly open . 
5657	br-k01	16	60	138847	When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a_little louder . 
5658	br-k01	17	61	138905	He had not mentioned Kate . 
5659	br-k01	17	62	138911	He had not even thought_about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly , almost accidentally , encounter her . 
5660	br-k01	17	63	138940	At these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest , but it was an objective pain , in_no_way different from others in intensity and not different in kind ; it was like the bandaged wound on the back of his head which occasionally throbbed ; it was merely another part of his weakness . 
5661	br-k01	17	64	138998	He was calm , drugged , and lazy . 
5662	br-k01	17	65	139007	He did not care . 
5663	br-k01	18	66	139012	Rachel mentioned Kate . 
5664	br-k01	18	67	139016	She said , `` I notice the girl from across the street has n't bothered to phone or visit '' . 
5665	br-k01	19	68	139037	Scotty said , `` That 's all_right . 
5666	br-k01	19	69	139045	Kate 's all_right '' . 
5667	br-k01	19	70	139050	He thought_about it briefly , then deliberately turned the talk to something else . 
5668	br-k01	20	71	139064	Once , sitting at the front window in his parents ' room , he saw Kate come_out of her house . 
5669	br-k01	20	72	139085	She was with Elizabeth . 
5670	br-k01	20	73	139090	They were far off and looked tiny . 
5671	br-k01	20	74	139098	The heavy branches in his front_yard would hide and then reveal them . 
5672	br-k01	20	75	139111	They turned at the bottom of Kate 's steps and moved off in the direction of the park . 
5673	br-k01	20	76	139130	He thought he saw - it awakened and , for a moment , interested him - that Elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash . 
5674	br-k01	20	77	139168	Then they disappeared and Scotty got_up and went_into his own room and got_into_bed . 
5675	br-k01	20	78	139182	By the time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing Kate . 
5676	br-k01	21	79	139197	The doctor , since Scotty was no_longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him , came often and informally to the house . 
5677	br-k01	21	80	139224	He would sit , slim-waisted and spare , on the edge of Scotty 's bed , his legs crossed so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor . 
5678	br-k01	21	81	139254	Scotty did not mind the doctor 's unsmiling teasing as he used_to . 
5679	br-k01	22	82	139267	`` Husky young_man '' , he said with mock distaste . 
5680	br-k01	22	83	139278	`` I imagine you 're always battling in school '' . 
5681	br-k01	23	84	139289	`` I do n't go_to school any_more '' . 
5682	br-k01	24	85	139298	`` Pardon '' ? 
5683	br-k01	24	86	139302	The doctor had to bend close to hear ; his delicate hand , as veined as a moth 's wing , rested absently on Scotty 's chest . 
5684	br-k01	24	87	139330	Scotty said the same words more loudly . 
5685	br-k01	24	88	139338	`` Oh . 
5686	br-k01	24	89	139341	Well , we 're taking a little vacation , that 's all '' . 
5687	br-k01	24	90	139355	He turned unsmilingly to Rachel . 
5688	br-k01	24	91	139361	`` I think by the end of next week he could get_out in the air a_little . 
5689	br-k01	24	92	139378	He could now but the weakness is very definite ; it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily . 
5690	br-k01	24	93	139396	He 'll be stronger soon '' . 
5691	br-k01	24	94	139403	His stethoscope was on the table by Scotty 's bed and he picked it up and wagged it at Scotty . 
5692	br-k01	24	95	139424	He said fussily , `` Just keep the cap on those strong emotions '' . 
5693	br-k01	24	96	139439	The stethoscope glinted silver in the darkening room . 
5694	br-k01	24	97	139448	`` I 'll drop_by again in a_few days '' . 
5695	br-k01	25	98	139458	Rachel stayed_on after the doctor had gone . 
5696	br-k01	25	99	139466	She smoothed the covers on Scotty 's bed and picked things up from the floor . 
5697	br-k01	25	100	139482	She did not touch him . 
5698	br-k01	25	101	139488	Scotty watched with disinterest . 
5699	br-k01	25	102	139493	He did not speak . 
5700	br-k01	25	103	139498	He had no desire to . 
5701	br-k01	26	104	139504	She said , `` Do you think you 'll miss school '' ? 
5702	br-k01	27	105	139517	He had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel had grown . 
5703	br-k01	27	106	139529	He did not care . 
5704	br-k01	27	107	139534	He felt her irritability did not concern him , yet he knew he would not care even if it did . 
5705	br-k01	27	108	139555	He shook his head . 
5706	br-k01	28	109	139560	`` We 've had any number of calls about you . 
5707	br-k01	28	110	139571	You could win a popularity_contest at that school without any trouble . 
5708	br-k01	28	111	139583	Miss_Estherson called twice . 
5709	br-k01	28	112	139587	She wants to pay you a visit . 
5710	br-k01	28	113	139595	She says the children miss you . 
5711	br-k01	28	114	139602	Apparently you were the light of their lives '' . 
5712	br-k01	29	115	139612	Scotty shrugged slightly . 
5713	br-k01	29	116	139616	Rachel came close to the bed , bent as if she would kiss him , then moved away . 
5714	br-k01	29	117	139635	She was frowning . 
5715	br-k01	29	118	139639	`` That doctor annoys me '' . 
5716	br-k01	29	119	139646	She seemed to speak_to herself . 
5717	br-k01	29	120	139652	`` Do you suppose his self-consciousness is characteristic of the new Negro professionals or merely of doctors in_general '' ? 
5718	br-k01	30	121	139672	She turned_to him again . 
5719	br-k01	30	122	139677	`` Well , Mrs._Charles_- Sally - has phoned too . 
5720	br-k01	30	123	139687	She was very worried '' . 
5721	br-k01	30	124	139693	Rachel 's tone was dry . 
5722	br-k01	30	125	139699	`` She did n't really say '' - She glanced away at the floor , then swooped gracefully and picked_up one of Scotty 's slippers . 
5723	br-k01	30	126	139725	`` I mean , do you feel_like seeing Kate '' ? 
5724	br-k01	31	127	139736	Scotty said , `` I do n't know '' . 
5725	br-k01	31	128	139746	It was true . 
5726	br-k01	31	129	139750	He did not . 
5727	br-k01	31	130	139754	There was the slight pain , but it was no different from the throbbing in his head . 
5728	br-k01	32	131	139772	`` Well , there 's time , in_any_case . 
5729	br-k01	32	132	139781	We 'll wait till you 're stronger and then talk_about it '' . 
5730	br-k01	32	133	139794	She put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed . 
5731	br-k01	33	134	139809	Scotty said , `` Okay '' . 
5732	br-k01	34	135	139816	This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead . 
5733	br-k01	34	136	139826	Scotty was pleased . 
5734	br-k01	35	137	139830	His father was a constant visitor . 
5735	br-k01	35	138	139837	Scotty would hear the front_door in the evening and then his father 's deep slow voice ; it floated up the stairs . 
5736	br-k01	36	139	139860	`` How 's Scotty '' ? 
5737	br-k01	37	140	139866	And Rachel 's or Virginia 's reply : `` Better . 
5738	br-k01	37	141	139877	He 's getting plenty of rest '' . 
5739	br-k01	38	142	139885	`` Is his appetite improved '' ? 
5740	br-k01	38	143	139892	Or : `` Does he get exercise '' ? 
5741	br-k01	39	144	139901	The exchange was almost invariable , and Scotty , in his bed , could hear every word of_it . 
5742	br-k01	39	145	139920	He never smiled . 
5743	br-k01	39	146	139924	It required an energy he no_longer possessed to be satirical about his father . 
5744	br-k01	39	147	139938	His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look_at his son . 
5745	br-k01	39	148	139957	After a pause , during which he studied Scotty 's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too , Mr._McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs . 
5746	br-k01	40	149	139992	Scotty would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat . 
5747	br-k01	41	150	140008	`` I'm eating more '' , he would say . 
5748	br-k01	41	151	140018	Or : `` I walk_around the house a_lot '' . 
5749	br-k01	42	152	140028	`` Perhaps you should get_out a_little '' . 
5750	br-k01	43	153	140036	`` I'm not supposed to yet '' . 
5751	br-k01	43	154	140044	He was not irritated . 
5752	br-k01	43	155	140049	He did not mind the useless , kindly questions . 
5753	br-k01	43	156	140059	He looked at the lined face with vague interest ; he felt he was noting it , as if it were something he might think_about when he grew stronger . 
5754	br-k01	44	157	140089	Mr._McKinley examined everything with critical care , seeking something material to blame for his son 's illness . 
5755	br-k01	45	158	140107	`` Have you got enough blankets '' ? 
5756	br-k01	45	159	140115	And another time , without accusation : `` You never wore that scarf I bought you '' . 
5757	br-k02	1	1	140133	Where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves upward in angry motion , Papa-san sat glacier like , his smooth solidity , his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him . 
5758	br-k02	1	2	140168	`` Our objective '' , the colonel had said that day of the briefing , `` is Papa-san '' . 
5759	br-k02	1	3	140188	There the objective sat , brooding over all . 
5760	br-k02	1	4	140197	Gouge , burn , blast , insult it as they would , could anyone really take Papa-san ? 
5761	br-k02	2	5	140215	Between the ponderous hulk and himself , in the valley over which Papa-san reigned , men had hidden high_explosives , booby_traps , and mines . 
5762	br-k02	2	6	140240	The raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion . 
5763	br-k02	2	7	140250	On the forward slope in_front_of his own post stretched two rows of barbed_wire . 
5764	br-k02	2	8	140264	At the slope 's base coils of concertina stretched out_of eye range like a wild tangle of children 's hoops , stopped simultaneously , weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child 's touch to start them all rolling again . 
5765	br-k02	2	9	140307	Closer still , regular barricades of barbed_wire hung on timber supports . 
5766	br-k02	2	10	140319	Was it all vain labor ? 
5767	br-k02	2	11	140325	Who would clean_up the mess when the war was over ? 
5768	br-k02	2	12	140336	Smiling at his quixotic thoughts , Warren turned_back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting_down . 
5769	br-k02	2	13	140354	Tonight a group of men , tomorrow night he himself , would go_out there somewhere and wait . 
5770	br-k02	2	14	140372	If he were to go with White , he would be out there two days , not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san , but moving ever deeper into enemy land - behind Papa-san itself . 
5771	br-k02	2	15	140414	Was this what he had expected ? 
5772	br-k02	2	16	140421	He had n't realized that there would be so much time to think , so many lulls . 
5773	br-k02	2	17	140439	Somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told , that combat was an intermittent activity . 
5774	br-k02	2	18	140457	Now he knew that the moment illuminated by the vision on the train would have_to be approached . 
5775	br-k02	2	19	140475	It could take_place tomorrow night , or it might occur months from now . 
5776	br-k02	2	20	140489	There was just too much time . 
5777	br-k02	2	21	140496	Time to become afraid . 
5778	br-k02	2	22	140501	White 's suggestion flattered , but he did not like the identity . 
5779	br-k02	2	23	140514	He did not spill_over with hatred for the enemy . 
5780	br-k02	2	24	140524	He had n't even seen him yet . 
5781	br-k02	3	25	140532	Pressing his cigarette out in the earth , Warren walked to the slit and scanned the jagged hills . 
5782	br-k02	3	26	140551	He saw no life , but still stood there for a time peering at the unlovely hills , his gaze continually returning to Papa-san . 
5783	br-k02	3	27	140576	He had come here in_order to test himself . 
5784	br-k02	3	28	140585	While most of his beliefs were still unsettled , he knew that he did not believe_in killing . 
5785	br-k02	3	29	140603	Yet , he was here . 
5786	br-k02	3	30	140609	He had come because he could not live_out his life feeling that he had been a coward . 
5787	br-k02	4	31	140627	There were ten men on the patrol which Sergeant_Prevot led out that next night . 
5788	br-k02	4	32	140642	The beaming rok was carrying a thirty caliber machine_gun ; another man lugged the tripod and a box of ammunition . 
5789	br-k02	4	33	140663	Warren and White each carried , in_addition to their own weapons and ammo , a box of ammo for the ROK 's machine_gun . 
5790	br-k02	4	34	140687	Others carried extra clips for the Browning_Automatic_Rifle , which was in the hands of a little Mexican named Martinez . 
5791	br-k02	4	35	140707	Prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon . 
5792	br-k02	4	36	140717	`` We just sit quiet and wait '' , Prevot had said . 
5793	br-k02	4	37	140730	`` Be sure the man nearest you is awake . 
5794	br-k02	4	38	140740	If Joe does n't show_up , we 'll all be back here at 0600 hours . 
5795	br-k02	4	39	140756	Otherwise , we hold a reception . 
5796	br-k02	4	40	140763	Then we pull_out under our mortar and artillery cover , but nobody pulls_out until I say so . 
5797	br-k02	4	41	140781	Remember what I said about going_out to get anybody left behind ? 
5798	br-k02	4	42	140793	That still holds . 
5799	br-k02	4	43	140797	We bring_back all dead and wounded '' . 
5800	br-k02	5	44	140805	At 2130 hours they had passed_through the barbed_wire at the point of departure . 
5801	br-k02	5	45	140819	Then began the journey through their own mine_fields . 
5802	br-k02	5	46	140828	Mines . 
5803	br-k02	5	47	140830	Ours were kinder than theirs , some said . 
5804	br-k02	5	48	140839	They set bouncing_betties to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully had them go_off at the head . 
5805	br-k02	5	49	140860	Mines . 
5806	br-k02	5	50	140862	Big ones and little . 
5807	br-k02	5	51	140867	The crude wooden boxes of the enemy , our nicely turned gray metal disks . 
5808	br-k02	5	52	140882	But theirs defied the detectors . 
5809	br-k02	5	53	140888	Mines . 
5810	br-k02	5	54	140890	A foot misplaced , a leg missing . 
5811	br-k02	5	55	140898	Mines . 
5812	br-k02	5	56	140900	All sizes : big ones , some wired to set_off a whole field , little ones , hand_grenade size . 
5813	br-k02	5	57	140920	Booby_traps to fill the head with chunks of metal . 
5814	br-k02	5	58	140930	Warren tried to shake_off the jumble of his fears by looking_at the sky . 
5815	br-k02	5	59	140944	It was dark . 
5816	br-k02	5	60	140948	Prevot had said that the searchlights would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours , `` which gives us time to get settled in position '' . 
5817	br-k02	6	61	140976	Because they were new men and to be sure that they did n't get lost , Prevot had placed Warren and White in the center of the patrol as it filed_out . 
5818	br-k02	6	62	141008	His eyes now fixed on White 's solid figure , Warren could hear behind him the tread of another . 
5819	br-k02	6	63	141028	He could also hear the stream which he had seen from his position . 
5820	br-k02	6	64	141042	They were going to follow it for part of their journey . 
5821	br-k02	6	65	141054	`` It 's safe '' , Prevot had said , `` and it provides cover for our noise '' . 
5822	br-k02	7	66	141074	Soon they were picking their way along the edge of the stream which glowed in the night . 
5823	br-k02	7	67	141092	On their right rose the embankment covered with brush and trees . 
5824	br-k02	7	68	141104	If a branch extended out too far , each man held it back for the next , and if they met a low overhang , each warned the other . 
5825	br-k02	7	69	141134	Thus , stealthily they advanced upstream ; then they turned to the right , climbed the embankment , and walked into the valley again . 
5826	br-k02	7	70	141159	There was no cover here , only grass sighing against pant-legs . 
5827	br-k02	7	71	141171	And with each sigh , like a whip in the hand of an expert , the grass stripped something from Warren . 
5828	br-k02	7	72	141193	The gentle whir of each footstep left him more naked than before , until he felt his unprotected flesh tremble , chilled by each new sound . 
5829	br-k02	7	73	141220	The shapes of the men ahead of him lacked solidity , as if the whip had stripped them of their very flesh . 
5830	br-k02	7	74	141243	The dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage , their dirge unsung for want of vocal_chords . 
5831	br-k02	7	75	141262	The warped , broken trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes . 
5832	br-k02	7	76	141274	Clumps of brush that they passed were so many enchained demons straining in anger to tear and gnaw on his bones . 
5833	br-k02	7	77	141296	Looming over all , Papa-san leered down at him , threatening a_hundred hidden malevolencies . 
5834	br-k02	7	78	141311	Off in the distance a searchlight flashed on , its beam slashing the sky . 
5835	br-k02	7	79	141326	The sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud , then reflected to the earth in a softer , diffused radiance . 
5836	br-k02	7	80	141347	Somewhere over there another patrol had need of light . 
5837	br-k02	7	81	141357	Warren thought_of all the men out that night who , like himself , had left their protective ridge and - fear working at their guts - picked their way into the area beyond . 
5838	br-k02	7	82	141391	From the east to the west coast of the Korean_peninsula was a strip of land in which fear filled men were at that same moment furtively crawling through the night , sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound , or shouting amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle blasts . 
5839	br-k02	7	83	141442	White 's arm went_up and Warren raised his own . 
5840	br-k02	7	84	141452	The patrol was stopping . 
5841	br-k02	8	85	141457	Prevot came_up `` Take that spot over there '' , he whispered , pointing to a small clump of blackness . 
5842	br-k02	8	86	141478	`` Give me your machine_gun ammo '' . 
5843	br-k02	8	87	141486	Warren handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line . 
5844	br-k02	9	88	141500	Lying in the grass behind the brush clump , Warren looked about . 
5845	br-k02	9	89	141513	The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush . 
5846	br-k02	9	90	141526	Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine_gun crew . 
5847	br-k02	9	91	141538	Even at this short distance they were only vague shapes , setting_up the machine_gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol . 
5848	br-k02	10	92	141571	Warren eased his rifle 's safety off and gently , slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with an X . 
5849	br-k02	10	93	141605	This he placed within quick reach . 
5850	br-k02	10	94	141612	The walk and his fears had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch of the night air . 
5851	br-k02	10	95	141635	Although the armored vest fitted the upper part of his body snugly , he felt no security . 
5852	br-k02	10	96	141653	Figures seemed to crouch in the surrounding dark ; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched . 
5853	br-k02	10	97	141682	Certain this menace was only imaginary , he yet stared in fascinated horror , his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon . 
5854	br-k02	10	98	141706	He was aware of insistent inner beatings , as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body . 
5855	br-k02	11	99	141725	Above , the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds , diluting the valley 's dark to a pallid light . 
5856	br-k02	11	100	141749	Then the figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees , standing like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene . 
5857	br-k02	11	101	141773	Even_so , he could not ease the tension of his body ; the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax . 
5858	br-k02	11	102	141803	Sensing the unseen presence of the other men in the patrol , he felt mutely united to these nine near strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him . 
5859	br-k02	11	103	141832	He sensed something precious in the perilous moment , something akin to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the French countryside , a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness . 
5860	br-k02	12	104	141862	In France he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown up to the sky , and always as he wandered , he felt a stranger to their exultation . 
5861	br-k02	12	105	141896	They were poems in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning - enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there . 
5862	br-k02	12	106	141929	Brittany , that stone-gray mystery through which he traveled for thirty days , sleeping in the barns of farmers or alongside roads , had worked some subtle change in him , he knew , and it was in Brittany that he had met Pierre . 
5863	br-k02	13	107	141974	Pierre had no hands ; they had been severed at the wrists . 
5864	br-k02	13	108	141987	With leather cups fitted in his handlebars , he steered his bicycle . 
5865	br-k02	13	109	142000	He and Warren had traveled together for four days . 
5866	br-k02	13	110	142010	They visited the shipyards at Brest and Pierre had_to sign the register , vouching for the integrity of the visiting foreigner . 
5867	br-k02	13	111	142032	He took the pen in his stumps and began to write . 
5868	br-k02	14	112	142044	`` Wait ! 
5869	br-k02	14	113	142047	Wait '' ! cried the guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside . 
5870	br-k02	14	114	142067	They crowded the small room and peered over one another 's shoulders to watch the handless man write his name in the book . 
5871	br-k02	15	115	142091	`` C'est formidable '' , they exclaimed . 
5872	br-k02	16	116	142099	`` Mais , oui . 
5873	br-k02	16	117	142104	C'est merveilleux '' . 
5874	br-k02	17	118	142108	And_then the questions came , eager , interested questions , and many compliments on his having overcome his infirmity . 
5875	br-k02	18	119	142128	`` Does n't it ever bother you '' , Warren had asked , `` to have people always asking you about your hands '' ? 
5876	br-k02	19	120	142153	`` Oh , the_French are a very curious people '' , Pierre had laughed . 
5877	br-k02	19	121	142168	`` They are also honest seekers after truth . 
5878	br-k02	19	122	142177	Now the_English are painfully silent about my missing hands . 
5879	br-k02	19	123	142187	They refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there . 
5880	br-k02	19	124	142200	The Americans , like yourself , take the fact for granted , try to be helpful , but do n't ask questions . 
5881	br-k02	19	125	142223	I'm used_to all three , but I think the_French have the healthiest attitude '' . 
5882	br-k02	20	126	142238	That was the day that Pierre had told Warren about the Abbey_of_Solesmes . 
5883	br-k02	20	127	142251	`` You are looking tired and there you can rest . 
5884	br-k02	20	128	142262	It will be good_for_you . 
5885	br-k02	20	129	142267	I think , too '' , he said , his dark eyes mischievous , `` that you will find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you have spoken '' . 
5886	br-k02	21	130	142302	Within two_weeks Warren was ringing the bell at the abbey gate . 
5887	br-k02	21	131	142314	The monk who opened the door immediately calmed his worries about his reception : `` I speak English '' , the old_man said , `` but I do not hear it very_well '' . 
5888	br-k02	21	132	142348	He smiled and stuck a large finger with white hairs sprouting on_it into his ear as though that might help . 
5889	br-k02	21	133	142369	Smiling at Warren 's protestations , the old monk took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor . 
5890	br-k02	21	134	142394	`` Will you please wait in here . 
5891	br-k03	1	1	142402	Mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next to the funeral_parlor on Pennsylvania_Avenue . 
5892	br-k03	1	2	142419	Al_'s_Little_Cafe was small , dark , narrow , and filled with the mingled scent of beer , tobacco smoke , and Italian cooking . 
5893	br-k03	1	3	142443	Hanging over the bar was an oil_painting of a nude Al had accepted from a student at the Corcoran_Gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke . 
5894	br-k03	1	4	142472	The nude was small and black-haired and elfin , and was called `` Eloise '' . 
5895	br-k03	2	5	142488	This was one place where Moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone noticing him , or at_least coming_up and hanging_around and wanting to know all the low-down . 
5896	br-k03	2	6	142521	The other patrons were taxi_drivers and art_students and small shopkeepers . 
5897	br-k03	2	7	142532	The reporters had not_yet discovered that this was his hideaway . 
5898	br-k03	3	8	142543	His friend Jane was with him . 
5899	br-k03	3	9	142550	She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too_much and did n't own the mint . 
5900	br-k03	3	10	142575	She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash , and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury . 
5901	br-k03	3	11	142607	This meant sorting_out press_clippings and the_like . 
5902	br-k03	4	12	142614	Jane sat receptive and interested . 
5903	br-k03	4	13	142620	Mickie had a pleasant glow as he said , `` You see , both of them , I mean the President and Jeff_Lawrence , are romantics . 
5904	br-k03	4	14	142647	A romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and all he has_to do is find the right key , and then divine justice and altruism will appear . 
5905	br-k03	4	15	142678	It 's like focusing a camera ; the distant ship is n't there until you get the focus . 
5906	br-k03	4	16	142697	You know what I'm talking_about . 
5907	br-k03	4	17	142703	I'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live with them . 
5908	br-k03	5	18	142718	`` But when it comes_to war , the Colonel knows what it is and Jeff does n't . 
5909	br-k03	5	19	142736	Mr._Christiansen knows that a soldier will get the Distinguished_Service_Medal for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric_chair as a civilian . 
5910	br-k03	5	20	142762	He had a mean , unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit , and someone invented the name Trig for him . 
5911	br-k03	5	21	142783	That 's to say , he was trigger_happy . 
5912	br-k03	5	22	142792	He 'd shoot at anything if it was the rear_end of a horse or his own sentry . 
5913	br-k03	5	23	142810	He was a wiry , inscrutable , silent country boy from the red_clay of rural Alabama , and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally make_fun of . 
5914	br-k03	5	24	142840	But not in_front_of Trig . 
5915	br-k03	5	25	142845	I heard of some that tried it back in the States , and he 'd knock them clear across the room . 
5916	br-k03	5	26	142867	There 'd been a pretty bad incident back at the Marine base . 
5917	br-k03	5	27	142880	A New_York kid , a refugee from one of the Harlem gangs , made_fun of Trig 's accent , and drew a knife . 
5918	br-k03	5	28	142904	Before the fight was over , the Harlem boy had a concussion and Trig was cut_up badly . 
5919	br-k03	5	29	142922	They caught Trig stealing liquor from the officers ' mess , and he got a_couple_of girls in_trouble . 
5920	br-k03	5	30	142940	The fear of punishment just did n't bother him . 
5921	br-k03	5	31	142950	It was n't there . 
5922	br-k03	5	32	142955	It was left_out of him at_birth . 
5923	br-k03	5	33	142962	This is why he made such a magnificent soldier . 
5924	br-k03	5	34	142972	He was n't troubled with the ordinary , rank-and-file fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers and whole companies under_fire running in panic . 
5925	br-k03	5	35	142998	It just did n't occur to Trig that anything serious would happen to him . 
5926	br-k03	5	36	143013	Do you get_the_picture of the kind of fellow he was '' ? 
5927	br-k03	6	37	143025	Jane nodded with a pleasant smile . 
5928	br-k03	7	38	143032	`` All_right . 
5929	br-k03	7	39	143035	There was a sniper 's nest in a mountain cave , and it was picking_off our men with devilish accuracy . 
5930	br-k03	7	40	143056	The Colonel ordered that it be wiped_out , and I suggested , ' You ask for volunteers , and promise each man on the patrol a quart of whisky , ten dollars and a week-end pass to Davao ' . 
5931	br-k03	7	41	143096	Trig was one of the five volunteers . 
5932	br-k03	7	42	143104	The patrol snaked around in back of the cave , approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls . 
5933	br-k03	7	43	143126	You could hear them from our outpost . 
5934	br-k03	7	44	143134	There was a_lot of shooting . 
5935	br-k03	7	45	143140	We knew the enemy was subdued , because a flare was fired as the signal . 
5936	br-k03	7	46	143156	So we hurried over . 
5937	br-k03	7	47	143161	Two of our men were killed , a third was wounded . 
5938	br-k03	7	48	143173	Trig and a very black colored boy from Detroit had killed or put out_of action ten guerrillas by grenades and hand-to-hand fighting . 
5939	br-k03	7	49	143196	When we got there , Trig and the Negro were quarreling over possession of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded Filipino . 
5940	br-k03	7	50	143221	The colored boy had it , and Trig lunged at him with a knife and said , ' Give that to me , you black bastard . 
5941	br-k03	7	51	143248	We do n't ' low nigras to walk on the same sidewalk with white_men where I come from ' . 
5942	br-k03	8	52	143268	`` The Negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound '' . 
5943	br-k03	9	53	143284	`` What did the Colonel do about the men '' ? 
5944	br-k03	9	54	143295	Jane asked in her placid , interested way . 
5945	br-k03	10	55	143304	Mickie laughed . 
5946	br-k03	10	56	143307	`` He recommended both of them for the DSM and the Detroit fellow for the Purple_Heart , too , for a combat inflicted wound . 
5947	br-k03	10	57	143332	So you see Mr._Christiansen knows what it 's all about . 
5948	br-k03	10	58	143343	But not Jeff_Lawrence . 
5949	br-k03	10	59	143347	When he was in the war , he was in Law or Supplies or something like that , and an old buddy of his told me he would come down on Sundays to the Pentagon and read the citations for medals - just like the one we sent_in for Trig - and go_away with a real glow . 
5950	br-k03	10	60	143405	These were heroes nine feet tall to him '' . 
5951	br-k03	11	61	143415	Jefferson_Lawrence was alone at the small , perfectly appointed table by the window looking_out_over the river . 
5952	br-k03	11	62	143432	He had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread_out like a serpent with two heads . 
5953	br-k03	11	63	143461	Open beside him was Mrs._Dalloway . 
5954	br-k03	11	64	143467	He thought how this dainty , fragile older woman threading her way through the streets of Westminster on a day in June , enjoying the flowers in the shops , the greetings from old friends , but never really drawing a deep , passionate breath , was so like himself . 
5955	br-k03	11	65	143518	He , and Mrs._Dalloway , too , had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug_into the bone_marrow of the spirit . 
5956	br-k03	12	66	143541	He had not because he was both poor and ambitious . 
5957	br-k03	12	67	143552	Poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious . 
5958	br-k03	12	68	143562	They cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars along a dark country lane . 
5959	br-k03	12	69	143583	No , they must look_the_other_way and climb one more painful step up the ladder . 
5960	br-k03	12	70	143598	He made the decision with his eyes open , or so he thought . 
5961	br-k03	12	71	143612	At any cost , he must leave the dreary Pennsylvania mining town where his father was a pharmacist . 
5962	br-k03	12	72	143631	And so he had , so he had . 
5963	br-k03	12	73	143640	At State_College , he had no time to walk among the violets on the water 's edge . 
5964	br-k03	12	74	143658	From his room he could look out in springtime and see the couples hand_in_hand walking slowly , deliciously , across the campus , and he could smell the sweet vernal winds . 
5965	br-k03	12	75	143690	He was not stone . 
5966	br-k03	12	76	143695	He was not unmoved . 
5967	br-k03	12	77	143700	He had to teach himself patiently that these traps were not for him . 
5968	br-k03	12	78	143714	He must mentally pull the blinds and close the window , so that all that existed was in the books before him . 
5969	br-k03	12	79	143737	At law_school , the same . 
5970	br-k03	12	80	143743	More of this stamping_down of human emotion as a young lawyer in New_York . 
5971	br-k03	12	81	143757	By the time he was prosperous enough - his goals were high - he was bald and afraid of women . 
5972	br-k03	12	82	143778	The only one who would have him was his cripple , the strange unhappy woman who became his wife . 
5973	br-k03	12	83	143798	Perhaps it was right ; perhaps it was just . 
5974	br-k03	12	84	143808	He had dared to defy nature , to turn his back to the Lorelei , and he was punished . 
5975	br-k03	12	85	143828	Like Mrs._Dalloway , with her regrets about Peter_Walsh , he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent . 
5976	br-k03	12	86	143850	If he had had a son , he would tell him , `` Gather ye rosebuds while ye may . 
5977	br-k03	12	87	143870	This same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying '' . 
5978	br-k03	12	88	143882	But then his son could afford it . 
5979	br-k03	13	89	143890	Lawrence was waiting for Bill_Boxell . 
5980	br-k03	13	90	143896	The Vice_President had called and asked if he could see the Secretary at his home . 
5981	br-k03	13	91	143912	He said the matter was urgent . 
5982	br-k03	13	92	143919	The Secretary was uneasy about the visit . 
5983	br-k03	13	93	143927	He did not like Boxell . 
5984	br-k03	13	94	143933	He suspected something underhanded and furtive about him . 
5985	br-k03	13	95	143942	Lawrence could not put his finger on_it precisely , and this worried him . 
5986	br-k03	13	96	143956	When you disliked or distrusted a man , you should have a reason . 
5987	br-k03	13	97	143970	Human nature was not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell . 
5988	br-k03	13	98	143987	Lawrence stared a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic , hoping that a clue to his dislike of the Vice_President would appear . 
5989	br-k03	13	99	144011	It did not . 
5990	br-k03	13	100	144015	Therefore , he decided he was unfair to the young_man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point_of_view . 
5991	br-k03	14	101	144038	A half_hour later the Vice_President arrived . 
5992	br-k03	14	102	144045	He looked very carefully at every piece of furnishing , as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind . 
5993	br-k03	14	103	144067	He observed the Florentine vase in the hall , the Renoir painting in the library , as_well_as the long shelves of well-bound volumes ; the pattern of the Oriental rug , the delicate cut-glass chandelier . 
5994	br-k03	15	104	144103	He said to the Secretary , `` I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre . 
5995	br-k03	15	105	144122	How did you find_out about this '' ? 
5996	br-k03	15	106	144130	He waved his arm around at the furnishings . 
5997	br-k03	16	107	144139	It was not a discourteous question , Lawrence decided . 
5998	br-k03	16	108	144149	This young_man had so little time to learn he had to be curious ; he had to find_out . 
5999	br-k03	16	109	144168	The Secretary did not tell him at what cost , at what loneliness , he learned these things . 
6000	br-k03	16	110	144187	He merely said , `` Any good decorator these days can make you a tasteful home '' . 
6001	br-k03	17	111	144205	The Vice_President said , `` If you hear of any names that would fix_me_cheap in_return_for advertising they decorated the Vice_President 's home , let me know . 
6002	br-k03	17	112	144232	I can do business with that kind '' . 
6003	br-k03	18	113	144241	Again , Lawrence thought a_little sadly , these were the fees of poverty and ambition . 
6004	br-k03	18	114	144257	Boxell did not have the chance to grow_up graciously . 
6005	br-k03	18	115	144267	He had to acquire everything he was going_to get in four years . 
6006	br-k03	19	116	144280	They had brandy in the library . 
6007	br-k03	19	117	144287	Boxell looked at Lawrence with a searching glance , the kind that a prosecuting_attorney would give a man on trial . 
6008	br-k03	19	118	144308	What are your weaknesses ? 
6009	br-k03	19	119	144313	Where will you break ? 
6010	br-k03	19	120	144318	How best to destroy your peace ? 
6011	br-k03	20	121	144325	The Vice_President said with a slight bluster , `` There is n't anyone who loves the President more_than I do . 
6012	br-k03	20	122	144346	Old_Chris is my ideal . 
6013	br-k03	20	123	144351	At_the_same_time , you have_to face facts and realize that a man who 's been in the Marine_Corps all his life does n't understand much about politics . 
6014	br-k03	20	124	144378	What does a monk know about sex '' ? 
6015	br-k03	21	125	144387	Lawrence listened with the practiced , deceptive calm of the lawyer , but his face was in the shadow . 
6016	br-k03	22	126	144407	`` So , we have_to protect the old_man for his own good . 
6017	br-k03	22	127	144420	You see what I mean . 
6018	br-k03	22	128	144426	Congress is full of politicians , and if you want to get_along_with them , you have_to be politic . 
6019	br-k03	22	129	144445	This is why I say we just can't go_ahead and disarm the Germans and pull_down our own defenses . 
6020	br-k03	22	130	144464	Let me tell you what happened to me today . 
6021	br-k03	22	131	144474	A fellow came_up_to me , a Senator , I do n't have_to tell you his name , and he told me , ' I love the President like a brother , but God_damn_it , he 's crucifying me . 
6022	br-k03	22	132	144513	I 've got a quarter of a_million Germans in my state , and those krautheads tune_in on Father_Werther every_night , and if he tells them to go_out and piss in the public_square , that 's what they do . 
6023	br-k03	22	133	144552	He 's telling them now to write letters to their Congressmen opposing the disarmament of Germany ' . 
6024	br-k03	22	134	144570	And another one comes to me and he says , ' Look_here , there 's a mill in my state employs five thousand people making uniforms for the Navy . 
6025	br-k04	1	1	144600	The Bishop looked at him coldly and said `` Take it or leave it '' ! 
6026	br-k04	2	2	144616	Literally , there was nothing else to do . 
6027	br-k04	2	3	144625	He was caught in a machine . 
6028	br-k04	2	4	144632	But Sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let 's go and see what it_'s like '' . 
6029	br-k04	3	5	144656	Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham , near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa_River , a small and dirty stream . 
6030	br-k04	3	6	144680	The city was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama . 
6031	br-k04	3	7	144717	But it had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black_Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived - servants and laborers huddled_together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime . 
6032	br-k04	4	8	144774	Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were . 
6033	br-k04	4	9	144801	Beyond were industries and factories . 
6034	br-k04	4	10	144807	Then they went_down to Black_Bottom . 
6035	br-k04	4	11	144813	In_the_midst of this crowded region was the Allen_African_Methodist_Episcopal_Church . 
6036	br-k04	4	12	144822	It was an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair . 
6037	br-k04	4	13	144837	But it was a landmark . 
6038	br-k04	4	14	144843	It had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town , black and white , knew of it . 
6039	br-k04	4	15	144864	It had just suffered a calamity , the final crisis in a long series of calamities . 
6040	br-k04	4	16	144881	For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead , and the city mourned him . 
6041	br-k04	5	17	144900	He was a loud-voiced man , once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability . 
6042	br-k04	5	18	144919	He was stern and overbearing with his flock , but obsequious and conciliatory with the whites , especially the rich who partly supported the church . 
6043	br-k04	5	19	144945	The Deacon_Board , headed by a black_man named Carlson , had practically taken_over as the pastor grew old , and had_its_way with the support of the Amen_corner . 
6044	br-k04	5	20	144973	The characteristic thing about this church was its Amen_corner and the weekly religious orgy . 
6045	br-k04	5	21	144988	A knot of old worshippers , chiefly women , listened weekly to a sermon . 
6046	br-k04	5	22	145003	It began invariably in low tones , almost conversational , and then gradually worked_up to high , shrill appeals to God and man . 
6047	br-k04	5	23	145027	And_then the Amen_corner took_hold , re-enacting a form of group_participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek_chorus , spreading down through the African forest , overseas to the West_Indies , and then here in Alabama . 
6048	br-k04	5	24	145065	With shout and slow dance , with tears and song , with scream and contortion , the corner group was beset by hysteria and shivering , wailing , shouting , possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force . 
6049	br-k04	5	25	145107	It spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed Negro religion . 
6050	br-k04	5	26	145131	It sometimes ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor . 
6051	br-k04	5	27	145148	To most of those who composed the Amen_corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience , something for which they lived from week to week . 
6052	br-k04	5	28	145174	It was often re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer_meeting . 
6053	br-k04	6	29	145188	Wilson , on his first Sunday , witnessed this with something like disgust . 
6054	br-k04	6	30	145202	He had preached a short sermon , trying to talk man-to-man to the audience , to tell them who he was , what he had done in Macon and Birmingham , and what he proposed to do here . 
6055	br-k04	6	31	145241	He sympathized_with them on the loss of their old pastor . 
6056	br-k04	6	32	145252	But then , at mention of that name , the Amen_corner broke_loose . 
6057	br-k04	6	33	145265	He had no chance to say another word . 
6058	br-k04	6	34	145274	At the very end , when the audience was silent and breathless , a collection was taken and then slowly everyone filed_out . 
6059	br-k04	6	35	145297	The audience did not think much of the new pastor , and what the new pastor thought_of the audience he did not dare at the time to say . 
6060	br-k04	7	36	145326	During the next weeks he looked over the situation . 
6061	br-k04	7	37	145336	First_of_all there was the parsonage , an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live_in , originally poorly conceived , apparently not repaired for years , with no plumbing or sewage , with rat-holes and rot . 
6062	br-k04	7	38	145373	It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church , a woman named Catt who , as Wilson afterward found , was briefly referred to as The_Cat because of her sharp_tongue and fierce initiative . 
6063	br-k04	8	39	145418	Ann_Catt was a lonely , devoted soul , never married , conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church , but a perpetual dissenter and born critic . 
6064	br-k04	8	40	145447	She soared over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository . 
6065	br-k04	9	41	145478	Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition . 
6066	br-k04	9	42	145489	The salary of the pastor had for years been $ 500 annually and even this was in_arrears . 
6067	br-k04	9	43	145507	Wilson made_up_his_mind that he must receive at_least $ 2500 , but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing . 
6068	br-k04	9	44	145529	The church itself must be repaired . 
6069	br-k04	9	45	145536	It was dirty and neglected . 
6070	br-k04	9	46	145542	It really ought to be rebuilt , and he determined to go_up and talk to the city banks about this . 
6071	br-k04	9	47	145563	Meanwhile , the city itself should be talked to . 
6072	br-k04	9	48	145573	The streets in the colored section were dirty . 
6073	br-k04	9	49	145582	There was typhoid and malaria . 
6074	br-k04	9	50	145588	The children had nowhere to go and no place to play , not even sidewalks . 
6075	br-k04	9	51	145604	The school was small , dark and ill-equipped . 
6076	br-k04	9	52	145613	The teacher was a pliant fool . 
6077	br-k04	9	53	145620	There were two liquor saloons not very far from the church , one white , that_is conducted for white people with a side_entrance for Negroes ; the other exclusively Negro . 
6078	br-k04	9	54	145651	Undoubtedly , there was a good_deal of gambling in both . 
6079	br-k04	10	55	145662	On the other side of the church was a quiet , well-kept house with shutters and recently painted . 
6080	br-k04	10	56	145681	Wilson inquired about it . 
6081	br-k04	10	57	145686	It was called Kent_House . 
6082	br-k04	10	58	145691	The deacon of the church , Carlson , was its janitor . 
6083	br-k04	10	59	145703	One of the leading members of the Amen_corner was cook ; there were two or three colored maids employed there . 
6084	br-k04	10	60	145724	Wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people , which seemed to him rather queer . 
6085	br-k04	10	61	145745	Why should a white hotel be set_down in the center of Black_Bottom ? 
6086	br-k04	10	62	145758	But nevertheless it looked respectable . 
6087	br-k04	10	63	145764	He was glad to have it there . 
6088	br-k04	11	64	145772	The rest of Black_Bottom was a rabbit_warren of homes in every condition of neglect , disrepair and careful upkeep . 
6089	br-k04	11	65	145792	Dives , carefully repaired huts , and nicely painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek_by_jowl with little distinction . 
6090	br-k04	11	66	145812	The best could not escape_from the worst and the worst nestled cosily beside the better . 
6091	br-k04	11	67	145828	The yards , front and back , were narrow ; some were trash_dumps , some had flower_gardens . 
6092	br-k04	11	68	145846	Behind were privies , for there was no sewage_system . 
6093	br-k04	12	69	145856	After looking about a_bit , Wilson discovered beyond Black_Bottom , across the river and far removed from the white city , a considerable tract of land , and it occurred to him that the church and the better Negro homes might gradually be moved to this plot . 
6094	br-k04	12	70	145904	He talked_about it to the Presiding_Elder . 
6095	br-k04	12	71	145911	The Presiding_Elder looked him over rather carefully . 
6096	br-k04	12	72	145919	He was not sure what kind of a man he had in_hand . 
6097	br-k04	12	73	145932	But there was one thing that he had_to stress , and that was that the contribution to the general church expenses , the dollar money , had been seriously falling_behind in this church , and that must be looked_after immediately . 
6098	br-k04	12	74	145973	In_fact , he intimated clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been sent here - to make a larger contribution of dollar money . 
6099	br-k04	13	75	145999	Wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was , they must have a better church , a more business-like conduct of the church organization , and an effort to get this religious center out_of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization . 
6100	br-k04	13	76	146045	He emphasized to the Presiding_Elder the plan of giving_up the old church and moving across the river . 
6101	br-k04	13	77	146063	The Presiding_Elder was sure that that would be impossible . 
6102	br-k04	13	78	146073	But he told Wilson to `` go_ahead and try '' . 
6103	br-k04	13	79	146084	And Wilson tried . 
6104	br-k04	14	80	146088	It did seem impossible . 
6105	br-k04	14	81	146093	The bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in_arrears , and the real_estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming_in , and that none would be sold to colored folk . 
6106	br-k04	14	82	146148	When it was proposed to rebuild the church , Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high . 
6107	br-k04	14	83	146170	He was sure that he could do better if he went_to Atlanta to get the deal financed . 
6108	br-k04	15	84	146188	But when this proposal was made to his Deacon_Board , he met unanimous opposition . 
6109	br-k04	15	85	146203	The church certainly would not be removed . 
6110	br-k04	15	86	146211	The very proposition was sacrilege . 
6111	br-k04	15	87	146217	It had been here fifty years . 
6112	br-k04	15	88	146224	It was going_to stay forever . 
6113	br-k04	15	89	146230	It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject . 
6114	br-k04	15	90	146242	As for rebuilding , well , that might be looked_into , but there was no hurry , no hurry at_all . 
6115	br-k04	16	91	146263	Wilson again went downtown to a different banker , an intelligent young white_man who seemed rather sympathetic , but he shook his head . 
6116	br-k04	17	92	146287	`` Reverend '' , he said , `` I think you do n't quite understand the situation here . 
6117	br-k04	17	93	146306	Do n't you see the amount_of_money that has been invested by whites around that church ? 
6118	br-k04	17	94	146322	Tenements , stores , saloons , some gambling , I hope not too_much . 
6119	br-k04	17	95	146336	The colored people are getting employment at Kent_House and other places , and they are near their places of employment . 
6120	br-k04	17	96	146357	When a city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them . 
6121	br-k04	17	97	146371	Now , if I were you I would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years . 
6122	br-k04	17	98	146396	By that time , perhaps something better can be done '' . 
6123	br-k04	18	99	146408	Then Wilson asked , `` What about this Kent_House which you mention ? 
6124	br-k04	18	100	146421	I do n't understand why a white hotel should be down here '' . 
6125	br-k04	19	101	146435	The young banker looked at him with a certain surprise , and then he said flatly : `` I'm afraid I can't tell you anything in_particular about Kent_House . 
6126	br-k04	19	102	146464	You 'll have_to find_out about it on your own . 
6127	br-k04	19	103	146474	Hope to see you again '' . 
6128	br-k04	19	104	146481	And he dismissed the colored pastor . 
6129	br-k04	20	105	146488	It was next day that Sojourner came and sat beside him and took his hand . 
6130	br-k04	20	106	146504	She said , `` My dear , do you know what Kent_House is '' ? 
6131	br-k04	21	107	146519	`` No '' , said Wilson , `` I do n't . 
6132	br-k04	21	108	146531	I was just asking about it . 
6133	br-k04	21	109	146538	What is it '' ? 
6134	br-k04	22	110	146543	`` It_'s a house_of_prostitution for white_men with white girls as inmates . 
6135	br-k04	22	111	146555	They hire a good_deal of local labor , including two members of our Trustee_Board . 
6136	br-k04	22	112	146570	They buy some supplies from our colored grocers and they are patronized by some of the best white gentlemen in town '' . 
6137	br-k04	23	113	146593	Wilson stared at her . 
6138	br-k04	23	114	146598	`` My dear , you must be mistaken '' . 
6139	br-k04	24	115	146608	`` Talk to Mrs._Catt '' , she said . 
6140	br-k04	25	116	146617	And after Wilson had talked to Mrs._Catt and to others , he was absolutely amazed . 
6141	br-k04	25	117	146633	This , of_course , was the sort of thing that used_to take_place in Southern cities - putting white houses_of_prostitution colored girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on openly . 
6142	br-k04	25	118	146663	But it had largely disappeared on_account_of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on_the_part_of the Negroes as they became more educated and got better wages . 
6143	br-k04	26	119	146690	But this situation of Kent_House was more subtle . 
6144	br-k04	26	120	146699	The wages involved were larger and more regular . 
6145	br-k04	26	121	146708	The inmates were white and from out of town , avoiding local friction . 
6146	br-k04	26	122	146722	The backing from the white town was greater and there was little publicity . 
6147	br-k04	26	123	146736	Good wages , patronage and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes . 
6148	br-k04	26	124	146751	And yet Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go . 
6149	br-k04	26	125	146765	And for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end of his career in the Methodist_church , if not in all churches . 
6150	br-k05	1	1	146794	Payne dismounted in Madison_Place and handed the reins to Herold . 
6151	br-k05	1	2	146805	There was a fog , which increased the darkness of the night . 
6152	br-k05	1	3	146818	Two gas_lamps were no more than a misleading glow . 
6153	br-k05	1	4	146828	He might have been anywhere or nowhere . 
6154	br-k05	2	5	146836	The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from Dr._Verdi . 
6155	br-k05	2	6	146848	Secretary_of_State Seward was a sick man . 
6156	br-k05	2	7	146855	The idea had come from Herold , who had once been a chemist 's clerk . 
6157	br-k05	2	8	146871	The sick were always receiving medicines . 
6158	br-k05	2	9	146878	No_one would question such an errand . 
6159	br-k05	2	10	146885	The bottle was filled_up with flour . 
6160	br-k05	3	11	146892	Before Payne loomed the Old_Clubhouse , Seward 's home , where Key had once been killed . 
6161	br-k05	3	12	146909	Now it would have another death . 
6162	br-k05	3	13	146916	From the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry . 
6163	br-k05	3	14	146929	He clomped heavily up the stoop and rang the bell . 
6164	br-k05	3	15	146940	Like the bell at Mass , the doorbell was pitched too high . 
6165	br-k05	3	16	146953	It was still Good_Friday , after_all . 
6166	br-k05	4	17	146960	A nigger boy opened the door . 
6167	br-k05	4	18	146967	Payne did not notice him . 
6168	br-k05	4	19	146973	He was thinking chiefly of Cap . 
6169	br-k05	4	20	146980	If their schedules were to synchronize , there was no point in wasting_time . 
6170	br-k05	4	21	146994	He pushed his way inside . 
6171	br-k05	5	22	147000	For a moment the hall confused him . 
6172	br-k05	5	23	147008	This was the largest house he had ever been in , almost the largest building , except for a hotel . 
6173	br-k05	5	24	147029	He had no idea where Seward 's room would be . 
6174	br-k05	5	25	147040	In the half darkness the banisters gleamed , and the hall seemed enormous . 
6175	br-k05	5	26	147054	Above him somewhere were the bedrooms . 
6176	br-k05	5	27	147061	Seward would be up there . 
6177	br-k05	6	28	147067	He explained his errand , but without bothering much to make it plausible , for he felt something well_up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army . 
6178	br-k05	6	29	147099	He did not really want to kill , but as in the sexual_act , there was a moment when the impulse took_over and could not be downed , even while you watched yourself giving_way to it . 
6179	br-k05	6	30	147136	He was no_longer worried . 
6180	br-k05	6	31	147141	Everything would be all_right . 
6181	br-k05	6	32	147146	He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped . 
6182	br-k05	7	33	147158	Still , the sensation always surprised him . 
6183	br-k05	7	34	147166	It was a thrill he felt no part in . 
6184	br-k05	7	35	147176	He could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick , appalling , and efficient things . 
6185	br-k05	8	36	147199	He brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up_the_stairs . 
6186	br-k05	8	37	147210	They were carpeted , but made for pumps and congress_gaiters , not the great clodhoppers he wore . 
6187	br-k05	8	38	147228	The sound of his footsteps was like a muffled drum . 
6188	br-k05	9	39	147239	At the top of the stairs he ran_into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing_gown . 
6189	br-k05	9	40	147255	He stopped and whispered his errand . 
6190	br-k05	9	41	147262	Young_Frederick_Seward held_out his hand . 
6191	br-k05	9	42	147267	Panting a_little , Payne shook his head . 
6192	br-k05	9	43	147275	Dr._Verdi had told him to deliver his package in_person . 
6193	br-k05	10	44	147285	Frederick_Seward said his father was sleeping , and then went through a pantomime at his father 's door , to prove the statement . 
6194	br-k05	11	45	147309	`` Very_well '' , Payne said . 
6195	br-k05	11	46	147316	`` I will go '' . 
6196	br-k05	11	47	147322	He smiled , but now that he knew where the elder Seward was , he did not intend to go . 
6197	br-k05	11	48	147343	He pulled_out his pistol and fired it . 
6198	br-k05	11	49	147351	It made no sound . 
6199	br-k05	11	50	147356	It had misfired . 
6200	br-k05	11	51	147360	Reversing it , he smashed the butt down on Frederick_Seward 's head , over_and_over_again . 
6201	br-k05	12	52	147375	It was the first blow that was always difficult . 
6202	br-k05	12	53	147385	After that , violence was exultantly easy . 
6203	br-k05	12	54	147393	He got caught_up into it and became a different person . 
6204	br-k05	12	55	147404	Only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless , so that he would puzzle_over it for days , whereas at the time it had seemed quite real . 
6205	br-k05	13	56	147433	The nigger boy fled down_the_stairs , screaming , `` Murder '' . 
6206	br-k05	14	57	147445	It was not murder at_all . 
6207	br-k05	14	58	147451	Payne was more methodical than that . 
6208	br-k05	14	59	147458	He was merely clearing a way to what he had_to do . 
6209	br-k05	15	60	147470	He ran for the sick_room , found his pistol was broken , and threw_it_away . 
6210	br-k05	15	61	147485	A knife would do . 
6211	br-k05	15	62	147490	From childhood he had known all about knives . 
6212	br-k05	15	63	147499	Someone blocked the door from inside . 
6213	br-k05	15	64	147506	He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness . 
6214	br-k05	15	65	147515	He saw only dimly moving figures , but when he slashed them they yelled and fled . 
6215	br-k05	15	66	147532	He went_for the bed , jumped_on it , and struck where he could , repeatedly . 
6216	br-k05	15	67	147548	It was like finally getting_into one 's own nightmares to punish one 's dreams . 
6217	br-k05	16	68	147563	Two men pulled him off . 
6218	br-k05	16	69	147569	Nobody said anything . 
6219	br-k05	16	70	147573	Payne hacked at their arms . 
6220	br-k05	16	71	147579	There was a lady there , in a nightdress . 
6221	br-k05	16	72	147589	He would not have wanted to hurt a lady . 
6222	br-k05	16	73	147599	Another man approached , this one fully dressed . 
6223	br-k05	16	74	147608	When the knife went_into his chest , he went_down at_once . 
6224	br-k05	17	75	147619	`` I'm mad '' , shouted Payne , as he ran_out into the hall . 
6225	br-k05	17	76	147634	`` I'm mad '' , and only wished he had been . 
6226	br-k05	17	77	147646	That would have made things so much easier . 
6227	br-k05	17	78	147655	But he was not mad . 
6228	br-k05	17	79	147661	He was only dreaming . 
6229	br-k05	18	80	147666	He clattered down_the_stairs and out of the door . 
6230	br-k05	18	81	147675	Somewhere in the fog , the nigger boy was still yelling murder . 
6231	br-k05	18	82	147688	One always wakes_up , even from one 's own dreams . 
6232	br-k05	18	83	147699	The clammy air revived him . 
6233	br-k05	18	84	147705	Herold , he saw , had fled . 
6234	br-k05	19	85	147713	Well , one did not expect much of people like Herold . 
6235	br-k05	20	86	147725	He unhitched his horse , walked it away , mounted , and spurred it on . 
6236	br-k05	20	87	147741	The nigger boy was close behind him . 
6237	br-k05	20	88	147749	Then the nigger boy turned_back and he was alone . 
6238	br-k05	20	89	147759	He rode on and on . 
6239	br-k05	20	90	147765	He had no idea where he was . 
6240	br-k05	20	91	147773	After some time he came to an open field . 
6241	br-k05	20	92	147783	An open field was better than a building , that was for_sure , so he dismounted , turned off the horse , and plunged through the grass . 
6242	br-k05	21	93	147811	He felt curiously sleepy , the world seemed far away ; he knew he should get to Cap , but he did n't know how . 
6243	br-k05	21	94	147837	He was sure , for he had done as he was told , had n't he ? 
6244	br-k05	21	95	147854	Cap would find him and take care of him . 
6245	br-k05	21	96	147864	So choosing a good tree , he clambered up into it , found a comfortable notch , and curled_up in it to sleep , like the tousled bear he was , with his hands across his chest , as though surfeited with honey . 
6246	br-k05	22	97	147908	Violence always made him tired , but he was not frightened . 
6247	br-k05	23	98	147920	In Boston , Edwin_Booth was winding_up a performance of A_New_Way_to_Pay_Old_Debts . 
6248	br-k05	23	99	147931	It was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think_about it any_more . 
6249	br-k05	23	100	147949	Acting soothed him . 
6250	br-k05	23	101	147953	On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual . 
6251	br-k05	24	102	147981	As Sir_Giles_Overreach ( how often had he had_to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he raised his arm and declaimed : `` Where is my honour now '' ? 
6252	br-k05	25	103	148018	That was one of the high spots of the play . 
6253	br-k05	25	104	148029	The audience , as_usual , loved it . 
6254	br-k05	25	105	148037	He was delighted to see them so happy . 
6255	br-k05	25	106	148046	If he had any worries , it was only the small ones , about Mother in New_York , and his daughter Edwina and what she might be doing at this hour , with her Aunt_Asia , in Philadelphia . 
6256	br-k05	26	107	148085	Everyone is ambivalent about his profession , if he has practised it long enough , but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there , who might cheer you or boo you , but that was largely , though not entirely , up_to_you . 
6257	br-k05	27	108	148137	They made the world seem friendly somehow , though he knew it was not . 
6258	br-k05	28	109	148152	Wilkes was quite right about one thing . 
6259	br-k05	28	110	148160	Laura_Keene had been in the green_room . 
6260	br-k05	28	111	148167	The commotion had brought her into the wings . 
6261	br-k05	28	112	148176	Since she could not act , one part suited her as well as any other , and so she was the first person to offer Mr._Lincoln a glass of water , holding it up to the box , high above her head , to Miss_Harris , who had asked for it . 
6262	br-k05	29	113	148228	She had been one of the first to collect her wits . 
6263	br-k05	30	114	148240	It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience , as that they had been stunned already . 
6264	br-k05	30	115	148261	Most of them had seen Our_American_Cousin before , and unless Miss_Keene was on stage , there was not much to it . 
6265	br-k05	30	116	148283	The theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom . 
6266	br-k05	31	117	148294	The stage had been empty , except for Harry_Hawk , doing his star monologue . 
6267	br-k05	31	118	148309	The audience was fond of Harry_Hawk , he was a dear , in or out of character , but he was not particularly funny . 
6268	br-k05	31	119	148334	At the end of the monologue the audience would applaud . 
6269	br-k05	31	120	148345	Meanwhile it looked at the scenery . 
6270	br-k05	32	121	148352	`` Well , I guess I know enough to turn you inside_out , you sockdologizing old mantrap '' ! said Trenchard , otherwise Hawk . 
6271	br-k05	32	122	148377	There was always a pause here , before the next line . 
6272	br-k05	33	123	148389	That was when the gun went_off . 
6273	br-k05	33	124	148396	Yet even that explosion did not mean much . 
6274	br-k05	33	125	148405	Guns were going_off all_over Washington_City these days , because of the celebrations , and the theatre was not soundproof . 
6275	br-k05	34	126	148425	Then the audience saw a small , dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential box . 
6276	br-k05	34	127	148443	`` Sic semper tyrannis '' , it said mildly . 
6277	br-k05	34	128	148453	Booth had delivered his line . 
6278	br-k05	34	129	148459	Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke . 
6279	br-k05	35	130	148469	They strained forward . 
6280	br-k05	35	131	148473	They had not heard what had been said . 
6281	br-k05	35	132	148482	They had been sitting too long to be able to stand_up easily . 
6282	br-k05	35	133	148495	The figure leapt from the box , almost lost its balance , the flag draped there tore in the air , the figure landed on its left leg , fell on its hands , and pressed itself up . 
6283	br-k05	36	134	148534	Harry_Hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings . 
6284	br-k05	36	135	148544	His speech faltered . 
6285	br-k05	36	136	148548	He did not lower his arm . 
6286	br-k05	37	137	148555	The figure was so theatrically dressed , that it was as though a character from some other play had blundered into this one . 
6287	br-k05	37	138	148579	The play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of The_Octoroon . 
6288	br-k05	37	139	148593	This figure looked_like the slave_dealer from that . 
6289	br-k05	37	140	148601	But it also looked_like a toad , hopping away from the light . 
6290	br-k05	37	141	148614	There was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them . 
6291	br-k05	38	142	148627	Then it disappeared into the wings . 
6292	br-k05	39	143	148634	Harry_Hawk had not shifted position , but he at_last lowered his arm . 
6293	br-k05	40	144	148647	Mrs._Lincoln screamed . 
6294	br-k05	40	145	148650	There was no mistaking that scream . 
6295	br-k05	40	146	148657	It was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do . 
6296	br-k05	40	147	148673	Yet this scream had a different note in it . 
6297	br-k05	40	148	148683	That absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them awake like a pail of water . 
6298	br-k05	41	149	148698	Clara_Harris , one of the guests in the box , stood_up and demanded water . 
6299	br-k05	41	150	148713	Her action was involuntary . 
6300	br-k05	41	151	148718	When something unexpected happened , one always asked for water if one were a woman , brandy if one were a man . 
6301	br-k05	42	152	148741	Mrs._Lincoln screamed again . 
6302	br-k05	43	153	148745	In the Presidential box someone leaned over the balustrade and yelled : `` He has shot the President '' ! 
6303	br-k05	44	154	148765	That got everybody up . 
6304	br-k05	44	155	148770	On the stage , Harry_Hawk began to weep . 
6305	br-k05	44	156	148779	Laura_Keene brushed by him with the glass of water . 
6306	br-k05	44	157	148789	The crowd began to move . 
6307	br-k05	44	158	148795	In Washington_City everyone lived in a bubble of plots , and one death might attract another . 
6308	br-k05	44	159	148812	It was not exactly panic they gave_way to , but they could not just sit there . 
6309	br-k05	44	160	148829	The beehive voices , for no_one could bear silence , drowned_out the sound of Mrs._Lincoln 's weeping . 
6310	br-k05	45	161	148847	At the rear of the auditorium , upstairs , some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor . 
6311	br-k05	45	162	148869	It would not give . 
6312	br-k05	46	163	148874	A Dr._Charles_Taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box . 
6313	br-k05	46	164	148893	In the audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob , on the same principle which had led Miss_Harris to demand water . 
6314	br-k05	47	165	148926	Someone opened the corridor door from the inside , and called_for a doctor . 
6315	br-k05	47	166	148940	Somehow Dr._Charles_Leale was forced through the mob and squeezed_out into the dingy corridor . 
6316	br-k05	47	167	148954	He went straight to the Presidential box . 
6317	br-k05	48	168	148962	As_usual , Mrs._Lincoln had lost her head , but nobody blamed her for doing so now . 
6318	br-k05	48	169	148979	There was a_little blood on the hem of her dress , for the assassin had slashed Miss_Harris 's companion , Major_Rathbone , with a knife . 
6319	br-k05	48	170	149005	Rathbone said he was bleeding to death . 
6320	br-k05	48	171	149013	By the look of him he was n't that far_gone . 
6321	br-k06	1	1	149024	With a sneer , the man spread his legs and , a third time , confronted them . 
6322	br-k06	2	2	149042	Once_more , Katie reared , and whinnied in fear . 
6323	br-k06	2	3	149052	For a moment , boy and mount hung in midair . 
6324	br-k06	2	4	149063	Stevie twisted and , frantically , commanded the mare to leap straight ahead . 
6325	br-k06	2	5	149077	But the stranger was nimbler still . 
6326	br-k06	2	6	149084	With a bold arm , he dared once_more to obstruct them . 
6327	br-k06	2	7	149096	Katie reared a third time , then , trembling , descended . 
6328	br-k06	3	8	149108	The stranger leered . 
6329	br-k06	3	9	149112	Seizing the bridle , he tugged with all his might and forced Katie to her knees . 
6330	br-k06	3	10	149129	It was absurd . 
6331	br-k06	3	11	149133	Stevie could feel himself toppling . 
6332	br-k06	3	12	149139	He saw the ground coming_up - and the stranger 's head . 
6333	br-k06	3	13	149151	With incredible ferocity , he brought his fists together and struck . 
6334	br-k06	3	14	149163	The blow encountered silky hair and hard bone . 
6335	br-k06	3	15	149172	The man uttered a weird cry , spun about , and collapsed in the sand . 
6336	br-k06	4	16	149188	Katie scrambled to her feet , Stevie agilely retaining his seat . 
6337	br-k06	4	17	149200	Again Katie reared , and now , wickedly , he compelled her to bring her hooves down again_and_again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger . 
6338	br-k06	4	18	149226	He could feel his own feet , iron-shod , striking repeatedly until the body was limp . 
6339	br-k06	4	19	149243	He gloated , and his lips slavered . 
6340	br-k06	4	20	149251	He heard himself chortling . 
6341	br-k06	5	21	149256	They rode around and around to trample the figure into the sand . 
6342	br-k06	5	22	149269	Only the top of the head , with a spot bare and white as a clamshell , remained visible . 
6343	br-k06	5	23	149289	Stevie was shouting triumphantly . 
6344	br-k06	6	24	149294	A train hooted . 
6345	br-k06	6	25	149298	Instantly , he chilled . 
6346	br-k06	6	26	149303	They were pursuing him . 
6347	br-k06	6	27	149308	He was frightened ; his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt . 
6348	br-k06	6	28	149322	Then Katie stumbled , and again he was falling , falling ! 
6349	br-k06	7	29	149334	`` Stevie ! 
6350	br-k06	7	30	149337	Stevie '' ! 
6351	br-k06	8	31	149340	His mother was nudging him , but he was still falling . 
6352	br-k06	8	32	149352	His head hung over the boards of Katie 's stall ; before it was sprawled the mangled corpse of the bearded stranger . 
6353	br-k06	9	33	149375	`` Stevie , wake_up now ! 
6354	br-k06	9	34	149381	We're nearly there '' . 
6355	br-k06	10	35	149386	He had been dreaming . 
6356	br-k06	10	36	149391	He was safe in his Mama 's arms . 
6357	br-k06	11	37	149400	The train had slowed . 
6358	br-k06	11	38	149405	Houses winked as the cars rolled beside a little depot . 
6359	br-k06	11	39	149416	`` Po ' Chavis '' ! the trainman called . 
6360	br-k06	11	40	149426	He came by and repeated , `` Po ' Chavis '' ! 
6361	br-k06	12	41	149438	Bong ! 
6362	br-k06	12	42	149440	Bong ! 
6363	br-k06	12	43	149442	startled him awake . 
6364	br-k06	12	44	149446	The room vibrated as if a giant hand had rocked it . 
6365	br-k06	12	45	149458	Bong ! 
6366	br-k06	12	46	149460	a dull boom and a throbbing echo . 
6367	br-k06	12	47	149468	The walls bulged , the floor trembled , the windowpanes rattled . 
6368	br-k06	12	48	149480	He stared at the far morning , expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon . 
6369	br-k06	12	49	149496	Bong ! 
6370	br-k06	12	50	149498	He raced to the window and yanked at the sash . 
6371	br-k06	12	51	149509	Bong ! 
6372	br-k06	12	52	149511	the wood was old , the paint alligatored . 
6373	br-k06	12	53	149520	Bong ! 
6374	br-k06	12	54	149522	A fresh breeze saluted him . 
6375	br-k06	12	55	149528	Six o'clock ! 
6376	br-k06	13	56	149531	He put his his head out . 
6377	br-k06	13	57	149538	There was the slate_roof of the church ; ivy climbed the red brick walls like a green scaled monster . 
6378	br-k06	13	58	149558	The clock which had struck presented an innocent face . 
6379	br-k06	14	59	149568	In the kitchen Mama was wiping the cupboards . 
6380	br-k06	15	60	149577	`` There 's a tower and a steeple on the church a_million feet high . 
6381	br-k06	15	61	149592	And the loudest clock in the whole world '' ! 
6382	br-k06	16	62	149602	`` I know , Stephen '' , she smiled . 
6383	br-k06	16	63	149612	`` They say that our steeple is one_hundred and sixty-two feet high . 
6384	br-k06	16	64	149625	The clock you heard strike - it 's really the town clock - was installed last April by Mrs._Shorter , on her birthday '' . 
6385	br-k06	17	65	149650	He dressed , and sped outdoors . 
6386	br-k06	17	66	149657	He crossed Broome_Street to Orange_Square . 
6387	br-k06	17	67	149663	The steeple leaned backward , while the church advanced like a headless creature in a long , shapeless coat . 
6388	br-k06	17	68	149683	The spire seemed to hold_up the sky . 
6389	br-k06	18	69	149691	Port_Jervis , basking in the foothills , was the city_of_God . 
6390	br-k06	18	70	149702	The Dutch_Reformed_Church , with two steeples and its own school was on Main_Street ; the Episcopal_Church was one block down Sussex_Street ; the Catholic Saint_Mary's_Church , with an even taller steeple and a cross on top , stood on Ball_Street . 
6391	br-k06	18	71	149743	The Catholics had the largest cemetery , near the Neversink_River where Main_Street ran south ; Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds . 
6392	br-k06	19	72	149767	God was everywhere , in the belfry , in the steeple , in the clouds , in the trees , and in the mountains hulking on the horizon . 
6393	br-k06	19	73	149796	Somewhere , beyond , where shadows lurked , must be the yawning pit of which Papa preached and the dreadful Lake_of_Fire . 
6394	br-k06	20	74	149818	So , walking in awe , he became familiar_with God , who resided chiefly in Drew_Centennial_Church with its high steeple and clock . 
6395	br-k06	20	75	149841	There was no church like Drew_Church , no preacher like Papa , who was intimate with Him , and could consign sinners to hellfire . 
6396	br-k06	20	76	149866	To know God he must follow in Papa 's footsteps . 
6397	br-k06	20	77	149877	He was fortunate , and proud . 
6398	br-k06	21	78	149884	The veterans , idling on their benches in the Square , beneath the soldiers ' monument , got_to_their_feet when Papa approached : `` Morning , Reverend '' ! 
6399	br-k06	21	79	149912	His being and His will - Stevie could not divide God from his Papa - illumined every parish face , turned the choir into a band of angels , and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven . 
6400	br-k06	22	80	149950	`` We have nine hundred and eleven members in our charge '' , Mama announced , `` and three hundred and eighty Sunday-school scholars '' . 
6401	br-k06	23	81	149976	When Papa went_out to do God 's work , Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy , which was drawn by Violet , the new black mare . 
6402	br-k06	23	82	150004	Although they journeyed westerly as far as Germantown , beyond the Erie roundhouse and the machine_shop , and along the Delaware and Hudson_Canal , and northward to Brooklyn , below Point_Peter , he could see the church spire wherever he looked_back . 
6403	br-k06	23	83	150046	Sometimes they went south and rolled past the tollhouse - `` Afternoon , Reverend '' ! 
6404	br-k06	23	84	150062	- and crossed the suspension_bridge to Matamoras ; that was Pennsylvania . 
6405	br-k06	24	85	150074	In the Delaware_River , three long islands were overgrown with greening trees and underbrush . 
6406	br-k06	24	86	150089	South of Laurel_Grove_Cemetery , and below the junction of the Neversink and the Delaware , was the Tri-State_Rock , from which Stevie could spy New_Jersey and Pennsylvania , as_well_as New_York , simply by spinning around on his heel . 
6407	br-k06	25	87	150128	On these excursions , Papa instructed him on man 's chief end , which was his duty to God and his own salvation . 
6408	br-k06	25	88	150152	However , a boy 's lively eyes might rove . 
6409	br-k06	25	89	150162	Where Cuddleback_Brook purled into the Neversink was a magnificent swimming_hole . 
6410	br-k06	25	90	150173	Papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing youth : `` Idle recreation '' ! 
6411	br-k06	25	91	150188	Stevie saw no idols ; it troubled him that he could n't always see what Papa saw . 
6412	br-k06	25	92	150206	He was torn between the excitement in the sun inflamed waters and a little engine chugging northward on the Monticello_Branch . 
6413	br-k06	26	93	150227	`` Where you been today '' ? 
6414	br-k06	26	94	150234	Ludie inquired every evening , pretending that he did not care . 
6415	br-k06	26	95	150246	`` He'll make a preacher out of you '' ! 
6416	br-k06	27	96	150256	`` No , he won't '' ! 
6417	br-k06	27	97	150263	Stevie flared . 
6418	br-k06	27	98	150266	`` Not me '' ! 
6419	br-k06	28	99	150271	`` Somebody 's got_to be a preacher in the family . 
6420	br-k06	28	100	150282	He made a will and last testament before we left Paterson . 
6421	br-k06	28	101	150294	I heard them ! 
6422	br-k06	28	102	150298	Uncle_and_Aunt_Howe were the witnesses '' . 
6423	br-k06	29	103	150304	`` Will he die '' ? 
6424	br-k06	30	104	150310	`` Everybody does '' . 
6425	br-k06	31	105	150315	Ludie could be hateful . 
6426	br-k06	31	106	150320	To speak of Papa dying was a sin . 
6427	br-k06	31	107	150329	It could never happen as_long_as God was alert and the Drew steeple stood_guard with its peaked lance . 
6428	br-k06	32	108	150347	Stevie was constantly slipping into the church . 
6429	br-k06	32	109	150355	He pulled with all his strength at the heavy , brass bound door , and shuffled along the wainscoted wall . 
6430	br-k06	32	110	150376	The cold , mysterious presence of God was all around him . 
6431	br-k06	32	111	150388	At the end of a shaft_of_light , the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon . 
6432	br-k06	32	112	150407	Far away , standing before a curtained window in the study room , was his father , hands tucked under his coattails , and staring into the dark church . 
6433	br-k06	32	113	150437	The figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence . 
6434	br-k06	33	114	150446	The boy shuddered at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkles and gray hair . 
6435	br-k06	33	115	150461	Would Papa really die ? 
6436	br-k06	33	116	150466	The mouth was thin lipped and wide , the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide . 
6437	br-k06	33	117	150485	When Papa 's slender fingers removed the spectacles , there were red indentations on the bridge of the strong nose . 
6438	br-k06	34	118	150506	`` It 's time you began to think on God , Stephen . 
6439	br-k06	34	119	150519	Perhaps one day He will choose you as He chose me , long_ago . 
6440	br-k06	34	120	150533	Therefore , give Him your affection and store up His love for you . 
6441	br-k06	34	121	150547	Open your heart to Him and pray , Stephen , pray ! 
6442	br-k06	34	122	150559	For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the Lake_of_Fire '' . 
6443	br-k06	35	123	150578	Stevie had heard these words many times , yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble . 
6444	br-k06	35	124	150596	For he feared the Lake_of_Fire . 
6445	br-k06	35	125	150602	He strove to think of God and His eternal wrath ; he must pray to be spared . 
6446	br-k06	36	126	150620	Papa was disappointed that none of the brothers had heard the Call . 
6447	br-k06	36	127	150633	Not George , Townley , or Ted , certainly not Ludie . 
6448	br-k06	36	128	150645	Burt was at Hackettstown and Will at Albany_Law_School , where they surely could not hear it . 
6449	br-k06	36	129	150662	Someday God would choose him . 
6450	br-k06	36	130	150668	He would hear the Call and would run to tell Papa . 
6451	br-k06	36	131	150680	The stern face would relax , the black clad arms would embrace him , `` My son '' ! 
6452	br-k06	36	132	150699	Yet how might he know the Call when it came ? 
6453	br-k06	36	133	150710	Probably , as in Scriptures , a still , small voice would whisper . 
6454	br-k06	36	134	150724	It would summon him once ; if he missed it , never_again . 
6455	br-k06	36	135	150737	What if it came when he was playing , or was asleep and dreaming ? 
6456	br-k06	37	136	150752	He must not fail to hear it . 
6457	br-k06	37	137	150760	He was Papa 's chosen ; therefore , nothing but good could happen to him , even in God 's wrathful storms . 
6458	br-k06	37	138	150783	When the skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley , he was unafraid . 
6459	br-k06	37	139	150799	Aggie might fly into a closet , shut the door and bury her head in the clothes ; he dared to wait for the lightning . 
6460	br-k06	38	140	150825	Lightning could strike you blind if you were a sinner ! 
6461	br-k06	38	141	150836	But he was good . 
6462	br-k06	38	142	150841	He clenched his fists and faced the terror . 
6463	br-k06	38	143	150850	Thunder crashed ; barrels tumbled down the mountainsides , and bounced and bounced till their own fury split them open . 
6464	br-k06	38	144	150871	Lightning might strike the steeples of the other churches ; not of Drew_Church . 
6465	br-k06	38	145	150885	A flash illumined the trees as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions . 
6466	br-k06	38	146	150899	Violet whinnied from the stable . 
6467	br-k06	39	147	150905	He ran out into the downpour , sped across the yard and into the buggy room . 
6468	br-k06	39	148	150922	`` Do n't be afraid , Violet '' ! 
6469	br-k06	39	149	150931	he shouted , and was aghast at the echoes . 
6470	br-k06	39	150	150941	`` Do n't you be afraid '' ! 
6471	br-k06	39	151	150949	He would save her . 
6472	br-k06	39	152	150954	If there was a fire or a flood he would save Mama first and Violet next . 
6473	br-k06	39	153	150971	Drenched and shaking , he stood near the sweet-smelling stall and dared to pat her muzzle . 
6474	br-k06	39	154	150988	`` Do n't you be afraid , Violet '' ! 
6475	br-k06	40	155	150998	After the storm , the sky cleared blue and cool , and fragrant air swept the hills . 
6476	br-k06	40	156	151016	When the sun came_out , Stevie strode proudly into Orange_Square , smiling like a landlord on industrious tenants . 
6477	br-k06	40	157	151035	The fountain had brimmed_over , the cannon were wet , the soldiers ' monument glistened . 
6478	br-k06	40	158	151051	Even before the benches had dried , the Civil_War veterans were straggling back to their places . 
6479	br-k06	40	159	151068	The great spire shone as if the lightning had polished it . 
6480	br-k06	40	160	151080	He jumped . 
6481	br-k06	40	161	151083	The pointed shadow had nearly touched him . 
6482	br-k06	41	162	151091	He trailed Ludie to the baseball_game in the lot on Kingston_Street near the Dutch_Reformed . 
6483	br-k06	42	163	151106	`` Go_on home '' ! 
6484	br-k06	42	164	151111	Ludie screeched at him . 
6485	br-k06	42	165	151116	`` Someone 'll tell Papa '' ! 
6486	br-k06	43	166	151123	No_one told_on Ludie , not even when he slipped live grasshoppers into the mite-box . 
6487	br-k06	43	167	151138	Ludie did as he pleased . 
6488	br-k06	44	168	151144	Ludie took his slingshot and climbed to the rooftop to shoot at crows . 
6489	br-k06	44	169	151158	Ludie chewed roofer 's tar . 
6490	br-k06	44	170	151164	Ludie had a cigar_box full of marbles and shooters , and a Roman_candle from last Fourth_of_July . 
6491	br-k06	44	171	151181	Ludie hopped rides on freight_cars , and was chased by Mr._Yankton , the railroad guard . 
6492	br-k06	44	172	151197	He came home overheated , ran straight to the ice-chest , and gulped shivery cold water . 
6493	br-k06	45	173	151214	Stevie envied him . 
6494	br-k06	45	174	151218	That Ludie ! 
6495	br-k06	45	175	151221	He , too , cocked his cap at a jaunty angle , jingled marbles in his pocket , and swaggered down Main_Street . 
6496	br-k06	45	176	151244	On the Christophers ' lawn , little girls in white pinafores were playing grownups at a tea_party . 
6497	br-k06	45	177	151262	A Newfoundland sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his size . 
6498	br-k06	45	178	151273	Stevie yearned for a dog . 
6499	br-k06	45	179	151279	He wondered whether God had a dog in the sky . 
6500	br-k06	46	180	151290	He meandered down Pike_Street , past the First_National_Bank with its green window_shades . 
6501	br-k06	46	181	151303	He crossed the tracks to Delaware_House , where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw boaters and waxed mustaches crowded the verandah . 
6502	br-k06	46	182	151327	A tall lady , with a ruffled collar very low on her bosom , turned insolent green eyes upon him . 
6503	br-k06	46	183	151348	She was taller than Aggie . 
6504	br-k06	46	184	151354	She was so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked . 
6505	br-k06	46	185	151372	Fiddles screeched ; a piano tinkled . 
6506	br-k06	47	186	151379	`` P.J. '' - as Ludie called the town - was crowded with summer people who came to the mountains to escape the heat in the big cities . 
6507	br-k06	47	187	151408	They stayed_at hotels and boardinghouses , or at private homes . 
6508	br-k06	47	188	151419	Rich people went_to Delaware_House , Opera_House , American_House or Fowler_House . 
6509	br-k07	1	1	151430	If the crummy bastard could write ! 
6510	br-k07	1	2	151437	That 's how it should be . 
6511	br-k07	1	3	151444	It 's those two fucken niggers ! 
6512	br-k07	1	4	151451	Krist , I wish they could write ! 
6513	br-k07	1	5	151459	Nigger pussy . 
6514	br-k07	1	6	151462	He thought_of sweet wet nigger pussy . 
6515	br-k07	1	7	151469	Oh , sweet land of heaven , haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy ! 
6516	br-k07	1	8	151485	He thought_of her , the first one . 
6517	br-k07	1	9	151493	He had caught her coming_out of the shack . 
6518	br-k07	1	10	151502	She was a juicy one . 
6519	br-k07	1	11	151508	Oh how they bounced ! 
6520	br-k07	1	12	151513	Fresh , warm , sweet and juicy , sweet lovin sixteen , she was . 
6521	br-k07	1	13	151528	Man how I love nigger pussy ! 
6522	br-k07	1	14	151535	The snow came a_little faster now , he noted . 
6523	br-k07	1	15	151545	He thought_of Joe_Harris , the nigger who had gone_after his sister . 
6524	br-k07	1	16	151557	He chuckled , the memory vivid . 
6525	br-k07	1	17	151564	Jee_-_sus , We Fixed him ! 
6526	br-k07	1	18	151570	Yooee , we fixed him ! 
6527	br-k07	1	19	151576	The snow again . 
6528	br-k07	1	20	151580	If only the fucken weather was n't so lousy ! 
6529	br-k07	1	21	151590	Goddamn niggers , Lord . 
6530	br-k07	1	22	151595	What I have_to put_up with ! 
6531	br-k07	1	23	151601	Sonuvabitch , I can n't figure_out what in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for . 
6532	br-k07	1	24	151621	Only one worth a shit , and that 's Brandon . 
6533	br-k07	1	25	151632	He ai n't so bad . 
6534	br-k07	2	26	151638	His thoughts turned_to other things . 
6535	br-k07	2	27	151644	The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those others done_for . 
6536	br-k07	2	28	151659	Kaboom for . 
6537	br-k07	3	29	151662	He had been pretty scared himself , wondering what_the_hell was coming_off . 
6538	br-k07	3	30	151674	But he soon saw which way the ball was bouncing . 
6539	br-k07	3	31	151685	Soon came_back to his senses . 
6540	br-k07	3	32	151691	`` I soon came_back to my senses '' , he said , aloud , to the young blizzard , proudly , drawing himself up , as if making a report to some important superior . 
6541	br-k07	3	33	151726	I was the first to get my squad on_the_ball , and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb . 
6542	br-k07	3	34	151747	Look_at thum . 
6543	br-k07	3	35	151750	That goddamn redheader was the worst . 
6544	br-k07	3	36	151757	He kept sayin , not me , not me , I do n't wanta wind_up like em . 
6545	br-k07	3	37	151775	But I told him , goddammit . 
6546	br-k07	3	38	151782	`` I told him '' , he said aloud . 
6547	br-k07	3	39	151792	`` They 'll get the guys that done it . 
6548	br-k07	3	40	151802	That 'll put the place back to normal . 
6549	br-k07	3	41	151811	Normal , by God . 
6550	br-k07	3	42	151816	Maybe it 's a good thing it happened . 
6551	br-k07	3	43	151825	Maybe they 'll stop it now , once for all . 
6552	br-k07	3	44	151836	Clean the place up . 
6553	br-k07	3	45	151841	They 're doin it now . 
6554	br-k07	3	46	151847	I hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow . 
6555	br-k07	3	47	151859	They 'll get the guys that done it '' . 
6556	br-k07	3	48	151869	There was something troubling him though : as_yet they had n't . 
6557	br-k07	3	49	151881	Five days . 
6558	br-k07	3	50	151884	Keerist . 
6559	br-k07	3	51	151886	Prickly twinges of annoyance ran_through him . 
6560	br-k07	3	52	151893	His eyes blinked hard , snapping on and squashing some bad things that were trying to push their way into him . 
6561	br-k07	3	53	151915	A tune began to whirl inside his head . 
6562	br-k07	3	54	151924	One of his favorites : `` Guitar_Boogie '' . 
6563	br-k07	3	55	151933	It always came_on , faithfully , just like a radio or juke_box , whenever he started to worry too_much about something , when the bad things tried to push their way into him . 
6564	br-k07	3	56	151967	The music drove them off , or away , and he was free to walk_on_air in a very few moments , humming and jiving within , beating the rhythm within . 
6565	br-k07	3	57	151998	He glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them . 
6566	br-k07	3	58	152014	Turn the bastards over to me - to me and my boys - no nigger ever got what would be comin to them - reactionary bastards . 
6567	br-k07	3	59	152041	He had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a POW began . 
6568	br-k07	3	60	152056	It was a word he was proud_of , a word that meant much to him , and he used it with great pleasure , almost as if it were an exclusive possession , and more : he sensed himself to be very highly educated , four_cuts_above any of the folks back home . 
6569	br-k07	3	61	152109	`` Four_cuts at_least '' , he chuckled to himself , `` and I owe it all to them '' . 
6570	br-k07	3	62	152129	The word also made him feel hate , sincere hate , for those so labeled . 
6571	br-k07	3	63	152145	He used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on_the_ball . 
6572	br-k07	3	64	152159	It came_up again_and_again in the discussion sessions . 
6573	br-k07	3	65	152167	Lousy Reactionary bastards been tryin to fuck_up the Program for months . 
6574	br-k07	3	66	152179	Months . 
6575	br-k07	3	67	152181	Hired , hard lackeys of the Warmongering Capitalists . 
6576	br-k07	3	68	152190	Not captured , sent here . 
6577	br-k07	3	69	152196	To fuck_up the Program . 
6578	br-k07	3	70	152201	You guys remember that . 
6579	br-k07	3	71	152206	Remember that . 
6580	br-k07	3	72	152209	He heard himself haranguing them . 
6581	br-k07	3	73	152215	He saw himself before them delivering the speech . 
6582	br-k07	3	74	152224	He laughed , suddenly , feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them , seeing himself before them , receiving utmost respect and attention . 
6583	br-k07	3	75	152253	One day , Ching had told him ( smiling , patting him on the back ) as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders , `` Keep it up , your squad is good , one of the best , keep it up , keep_up the good work '' . 
6584	br-k07	3	76	152305	He would ! 
6585	br-k07	3	77	152308	That was really something , coming from Ching . 
6586	br-k07	3	78	152317	`` Really something '' , he said , aloud . 
6587	br-k07	3	79	152327	Dirty Reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin_off ol Slater and those other poor bastards . 
6588	br-k07	3	80	152346	`` They 'll get them by God and let them bring them down here to me , just let them , God I 'll slice their balls right off '' . 
6589	br-k07	3	81	152377	His arm moved swiftly , violently , once , twice . 
6590	br-k07	3	82	152388	He felt intense satisfaction . 
6591	br-k07	3	83	152393	He was tingling within . 
6592	br-k07	3	84	152398	Before him , mutilated , bleeding to death , they lay . 
6593	br-k07	3	85	152410	It was as if it had been done . 
6594	br-k07	3	86	152419	`` Bastards '' , he said aloud , spitting on them . 
6595	br-k07	3	87	152431	He halted , and looked_around . 
6596	br-k07	3	88	152437	Rivers of cold_sweat were suddenly unleashed within him . 
6597	br-k07	3	89	152446	The thought came_back , the one nagging at him these past four days . 
6598	br-k07	3	90	152460	He tried to stifle it . 
6599	br-k07	3	91	152466	But the words were forming . 
6600	br-k07	3	92	152472	He knew he could n't . 
6601	br-k07	3	93	152478	He braced himself . 
6602	br-k07	3	94	152482	Somebody 'll hafta start thinkin . 
6603	br-k07	3	95	152488	He fought it , seeking to kill the last few words , but on they came `` bout takin - his '' . 
6604	br-k07	3	96	152511	He was trembling , a strange feeling upon him , fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on_the_spot . 
6605	br-k07	3	97	152531	But it did n't . 
6606	br-k07	3	98	152536	And he took_heart ; the final word came_forth `` place '' . 
6607	br-k07	3	99	152548	Now he heard it , fully : `` bout takin his place '' . 
6608	br-k07	3	100	152562	He listened , waited , nothing happened . 
6609	br-k07	3	101	152570	He felt good . 
6610	br-k07	3	102	152574	His old self . 
6611	br-k07	3	103	152578	The music arrived , taking him , its rhythm stroked him , snaked all through him , the lyrics lifted him , took him from one magic isle to another , stopping briefly at each . 
6612	br-k07	3	104	152614	Brandon . 
6613	br-k07	3	105	152616	He is good . 
6614	br-k07	3	106	152620	Damn good . 
6615	br-k07	3	107	152623	But a nigger . 
6616	br-k07	3	108	152627	Johnson . 
6617	br-k07	3	109	152629	Jesus , the guy says he is trying . 
6618	br-k07	3	110	152638	But he is n't with_it , not at all with_it . 
6619	br-k07	3	111	152649	When I talked to Ching about it , he said , Everyone can learn , if he is not a Reactionary or lazy . 
6620	br-k07	3	112	152673	No_one is stupid . 
6621	br-k07	3	113	152677	That 's what he said . 
6622	br-k07	3	114	152683	He oughta know . 
6623	br-k07	3	115	152687	It is plain as hell Johnson is no Reactionary . 
6624	br-k07	3	116	152697	So you 're not tryin , Johnson , you bastard you . 
6625	br-k07	3	117	152709	He looked over at him , lying there , asleep , and he felt a wave of revulsion . 
6626	br-k07	3	118	152728	How he loathed him . 
6627	br-k07	3	119	152733	Sleepy-eyed , soft-spoken Johnson . 
6628	br-k07	3	120	152738	Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad . 
6629	br-k07	3	121	152749	He was the guy what always goofed at Question Time . 
6630	br-k07	3	122	152760	Why could n't they have dumped him off on someone else ? 
6631	br-k07	3	123	152772	Why me ? 
6632	br-k07	3	124	152775	Why did n't the damn Reactionaries bump him off ? 
6633	br-k07	3	125	152785	Why Slater ? 
6634	br-k07	3	126	152788	Like a particle drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind . 
6635	br-k07	3	127	152808	The music surged up , but it failed to check it . 
6636	br-k07	3	128	152820	Who is the man to take His place ? 
6637	br-k07	3	129	152829	The guy with most on_the_Ball . 
6638	br-k07	3	130	152835	Most on_the_Ball . 
6639	br-k07	3	131	152838	Handle men . 
6640	br-k07	3	132	152841	Thoroughly Wised_Up . 
6641	br-k07	3	133	152844	Knows_the_score . 
6642	br-k07	3	134	152846	With a supreme effort , he broke it off . 
6643	br-k07	3	135	152856	He turned to the window again . 
6644	br-k07	3	136	152863	A gnawing and gnashing within him . 
6645	br-k07	3	137	152870	The snow was tumbling down furiously now . 
6646	br-k07	3	138	152878	Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground , piling higher and higher . 
6647	br-k07	3	139	152889	He stared at it , amazed , alarmed . 
6648	br-k07	3	140	152898	The whole fucken sky 's cavin in ! 
6649	br-k07	3	141	152906	Keeeerist ! 
6650	br-k07	3	142	152908	Lookit it ! 
6651	br-k07	3	143	152911	Cover the whole building , bury us all , by nightfall . 
6652	br-k07	3	144	152923	Jesus ! 
6653	br-k07	3	145	152925	Somebody , got_to be somebody . 
6654	br-k07	3	146	152931	If I do n't put_my_two_cents_in soon , somebody else will . 
6655	br-k07	3	147	152942	I know they 're waitin only for one thing : 
6656	br-k07	3	148	152952	for the bastards what done it to be nailed . 
6657	br-k07	3	149	152962	Maybe they already got them . 
6658	br-k07	3	150	152968	He was again tingling with pleasure , seeing himself clearly in Slater 's shoes . 
6659	br-k07	3	151	152983	Top_dog , sleeping and eating right there with the Staff . 
6660	br-k07	3	152	152994	Ching , Tien , all_of them . 
6661	br-k07	3	153	153001	Top_dog . 
6662	br-k07	3	154	153003	Poor ol Slater . 
6663	br-k07	3	155	153007	Jesus , imagine , the crummy bastards , they 'll get em , they 'll get what 's comin to em * * h He whirled about suddenly . 
6664	br-k07	3	156	153036	It was nothing , though his heart was thumping wildly . 
6665	br-k07	3	157	153047	Somebody was up . 
6666	br-k07	3	158	153051	That was all . 
6667	br-k07	4	159	153055	`` Boy , you 're stirrin early '' , a sleepy voice said . 
6668	br-k07	5	160	153069	`` Yehhh '' , said Coughlin , testily , eyeing him up_and_down . 
6669	br-k07	6	161	153082	`` Lookit that come_down , willya '' , said the man , scratching himself , yawning . 
6670	br-k07	7	162	153099	`` Yehhh '' , said Coughlin , practically spitting on him . 
6671	br-k07	8	163	153111	The man moved away . 
6672	br-k07	9	164	153116	That 's the way . 
6673	br-k07	9	165	153121	They 'll toe_the_line . 
6674	br-k07	9	166	153125	Goddamn it . 
6675	br-k07	9	167	153128	Keep the chatter to a minimum , short answers , one word , if possible . 
6676	br-k07	9	168	153144	Less bull the more you can do with um . 
6677	br-k07	9	169	153154	That 's Brown 's trouble . 
6678	br-k07	9	170	153160	All he does is to bullshit with his squad , and they are the stupidest bastards around . 
6679	br-k07	9	171	153178	Just about to get their asses kicked into hut Seven . 
6680	br-k07	9	172	153189	Plenty of room there now . 
6681	br-k07	9	173	153195	All those dumb 8 - Balls croaked . 
6682	br-k07	9	174	153203	You can do anything with these dumb fucks if you know how . 
6683	br-k07	9	175	153216	Anything . 
6684	br-k07	9	176	153218	They 'd cut their mothers ' belly open . 
6685	br-k07	9	177	153227	Give um the works . 
6686	br-k07	9	178	153232	See , he 's already snapping it up , the dumb jerk * * h Coughlin grinned , feeling supremely on_top_of things * * h He watched the snow once_again . 
6687	br-k07	9	179	153263	It infuriated him . 
6688	br-k07	9	180	153267	It made no sense to him * * h He whirled around , suddenly hot all_over , finding the man who had been standing before him a_few moments back , nailing him to the spot on which he now stood , open-mouthed - 
6689	br-k07	10	181	153310	`` You - Listen ! 
6690	br-k07	10	182	153315	- name William_Foster 's Four_Internal_Contradictions in Capitalism . 
6691	br-k07	10	183	153323	Quick - Quick - Now '' ! 
6692	br-k07	12	184	153330	The man shrank before the hot fury , searching frantically for the answer * * h Finnegan woke_up . 
6693	br-k07	12	185	153349	There was a_hell_of_a noise this time of morning . 
6694	br-k07	12	186	153358	He stared out the window . 
6695	br-k07	12	187	153364	For_Christ's_sake ! 
6696	br-k07	12	188	153366	The whole fucken sky 's caved_in ! 
6697	br-k07	12	189	153373	He looked_for the source of the noise that had awakened him * * h It was that prick Coughlin . 
6698	br-k07	12	190	153393	What the hell was he up_to now ? 
6699	br-k07	12	191	153401	Why did n't he drop_dead ? 
6700	br-k07	12	192	153407	How did they miss him when they got Slater ? 
6701	br-k07	12	193	153417	How ? 
6702	br-k07	12	194	153419	* * h Then he was asking himself the usual early morning questions : What the Hell am I doin here ? 
6703	br-k07	12	195	153441	Is this a nut-house ? 
6704	br-k07	12	196	153446	Am I nuts ?

6706	br-k07	12	198	153455	Am I dreamin ? 
6707	br-k07	13	199	153459	* * h From somewhere in the hut came Coughlin 's voice . 
6708	br-k07	14	200	153472	`` How long did you study ? 
6709	br-k07	14	201	153479	How long , buddy '' ? 
6710	br-k07	15	202	153485	`` For_Christ's_sake '' ! a voice pleaded . 
6711	br-k07	16	203	153493	`` Do n't Christsake me , buddy ! 
6712	br-k07	16	204	153501	Just answer . 
6713	br-k07	16	205	153504	C'mon - c'mon ! '' 
6714	br-k07	16	206	153509	* * h I'm no hero . 
6715	br-k07	16	207	153516	Did I start the damn war ? 
6716	br-k07	16	208	153523	* * h Automatically , Finnegan started going_over today 's lesson * * h Capitalism rots from the core . 
6717	br-k07	16	209	153543	Did I start the damn war ? 
6718	br-k07	16	210	153550	Who did ? 
6719	br-k07	16	211	153553	That 's a good one . 
6720	br-k07	16	212	153559	I thought I knew . 
6721	br-k07	16	213	153564	Why do n't Uncle_Sam mind his own fucken business ? 
6722	br-k07	16	214	153574	I 'll bet both together did . 
6723	br-k07	16	215	153581	I bet . 
6724	br-k07	16	216	153584	So fuck them both . 
6725	br-k07	16	217	153589	Goddamn . 
6726	br-k07	16	218	153591	Goddammit . 
6727	br-k07	16	219	153593	Just let me go_home to Jersey , back to the shore , oh , Jesus , the shore . 
6728	br-k07	16	220	153612	The waves breakin in on you and your girl at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight even Jesus sweet Mary . 
6729	br-k07	16	221	153636	If I hafta do this to stay alive by God I 'll do it . 
6730	br-k07	16	222	153651	I hated the goddamn army from the first day I got_in anyhow . 
6731	br-k07	16	223	153664	All pricks like Coughlin run it anyway , one way or another . 
6732	br-k07	16	224	153677	Fuck them * * h He rolled_over and tried to shut_out the noise , now much louder . 
6733	br-k07	17	225	153695	He snuggled into the blanket * * h Brandon dreamed . 
6734	br-k07	17	226	153706	He was sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water . 
6735	br-k07	17	227	153724	A river , wide as the Missouri , where it ran_by his place . 
6736	br-k07	17	228	153738	The log was spinning . 
6737	br-k07	17	229	153743	But he was not . 
6738	br-k07	17	230	153748	So what ? 
6739	br-k07	17	231	153751	Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning ? 
6740	br-k07	17	232	153764	( he asked this out_loud , but no_one heard it over the other noise in the hut ) . 
6741	br-k07	17	233	153783	Over on the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him . 
6742	br-k07	17	234	153800	He could n't make_out what he was saying . 
6743	br-k07	17	235	153809	No_doubt it had to do with the log . 
6744	br-k07	17	236	153818	Why should he be concerned ? 
6745	br-k08	1	1	153824	Rousseau is so persuasive that Voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books , too . 
6746	br-k08	1	2	153842	But while the two men are riding into the country , where they are going to dinner , they are attacked in the dark of the forest by a band of thieves , who strip them of everything , including most of their clothes . 
6747	br-k08	2	3	153887	`` You must be a very learned man '' , says Voltaire to one of the bandits . 
6748	br-k08	3	4	153905	`` A learned man '' ? the bandit laughs in his face . 
6749	br-k08	4	5	153918	But Voltaire perseveres . 
6750	br-k08	4	6	153922	He goes_to the chief himself . 
6751	br-k08	4	7	153928	`` At what university did you study '' ? he asks . 
6752	br-k08	4	8	153940	He refuses to believe that the bandit chief never attended a higher institution . 
6753	br-k08	4	9	153954	`` To have become so corrupt '' , he says , `` surely you must have studied many arts and sciences '' . 
6754	br-k08	5	10	153977	The chief , annoyed by these questions , knocks Voltaire down and shouts at him that he not_only never went_to any school , but never even learned how to read . 
6755	br-k08	6	11	154008	When finally the two bedraggled men reach their friend 's home , Voltaire 's fears are once_again aroused . 
6756	br-k08	6	12	154027	For it is such a distinguished place , with such fine works_of_art and such a big library , that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become depraved by all this culture . 
6757	br-k08	7	13	154063	To Voltaire 's surprise , however , their host gives them fresh clothes to put_on , opens his purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner . 
6758	br-k08	8	14	154095	Immediately after dinner , however , Rousseau asks for still another favor . 
6759	br-k08	8	15	154108	Could he have pen and paper , please ? 
6760	br-k08	8	16	154117	He is in a hurry to write another essay against culture . 
6761	br-k08	9	17	154129	Such was the impromptu that Voltaire gave to howls of laughter at Sans_Souci and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe , to be printed sometime later , but with the name of Timon_of_Athens , the famous misanthrope , substituted for that of Rousseau . 
6762	br-k08	10	18	154179	How cruel ! 
6763	br-k08	11	19	154182	But at_the_same_time how understandable . 
6764	br-k08	11	20	154187	How could the rich , for whom life was made so simple , ever understand the subterfuges , the lies , the frauds , the errors , sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life ? 
6765	br-k08	12	21	154241	How , for_example , could a Voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a Rousseau would find himself when , soon after the furor of his first Discourse , he acquired still another title to fame ? 
6766	br-k08	13	22	154278	This time as a musician . 
6767	br-k08	13	23	154284	As a composer . 
6768	br-k08	14	24	154288	Ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it , Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through to fame as the result of a successful opera . 
6769	br-k08	14	25	154318	But his facility in this genre was not great . 
6770	br-k08	14	26	154328	And his efforts to get a performance for his Gallant_Muses invariably failed . 
6771	br-k08	14	27	154341	And for good reasons . 
6772	br-k08	14	28	154346	His operatic music had little merit . 
6773	br-k08	15	29	154353	But then one day , while on a week 's visit to the country home of a retired Swiss jeweler , Rousseau amused the company with a_few little melodies he had written , to which he attached no great importance . 
6774	br-k08	15	30	154394	He was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs . 
6775	br-k08	16	31	154411	`` Put a_few such songs together '' , they urged him . 
6776	br-k08	16	32	154423	`` String them onto some sort of little plot , and you 'll have a delightful operetta '' . 
6777	br-k08	17	33	154442	He did n't believe them . 
6778	br-k08	17	34	154448	`` Nonsense '' , he said . 
6779	br-k08	17	35	154455	`` This is the sort of stuff I write and then throw_away '' ! 
6780	br-k08	18	36	154469	`` Heaven_forbid '' ! cried the ladies , enchanted by his music . 
6781	br-k08	18	37	154482	`` You must make an opera out of this material '' . 
6782	br-k08	19	38	154494	And they would n't leave_off arguing and pleading until he had promised . 
6783	br-k08	20	39	154507	Oh , the irony and the bitterness of_it ! 
6784	br-k08	20	40	154516	That after all his years of effort to become a composer , he should now , now when he was still stoutly replying to the critics of his Discourse_on_the_Arts_and_Sciences , be so close to a success in music and have_to reject it . 
6785	br-k08	21	41	154559	Or at_least appear to reject it ! 
6786	br-k08	22	42	154566	But what else could he do ? 
6787	br-k08	22	43	154573	You could n't on_the_one_hand decry the arts and at_the_same_time practice them , could you ? 
6788	br-k08	22	44	154588	Well , yes , perhaps in literature , since you could argue that you could n't keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself . 
6789	br-k08	22	45	154620	But now music too ? 
6790	br-k08	22	46	154625	No . 
6791	br-k08	22	47	154627	That would be too_much ! 
6792	br-k08	23	48	154632	And the fault , of_course , was Rameau 's . 
6793	br-k08	23	49	154642	The fault was Rameau 's and that of the whole culture of this Parisian age . 
6794	br-k08	23	50	154658	For it was Rameau 's type of music that he had been trying to write , and that he could n't write . 
6795	br-k08	23	51	154681	These little songs , however , were sweet_nothings from_the_heart , tender memories of his childhood , little melodies that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep . 
6796	br-k08	24	52	154712	But no . 
6797	br-k08	24	53	154715	He could n't appear as a composer now . 
6798	br-k08	24	54	154724	That glory , craved for so long , was now forbidden to him . 
6799	br-k08	24	55	154738	Still , just for the ladies , and just for this once , for this one weekend in the country , he would make a little piece out of his melodies . 
6800	br-k08	25	56	154770	The ladies were delighted and Jean_Jacques was applauded . 
6801	br-k08	25	57	154779	And everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote . 
6802	br-k08	26	58	154792	But then , after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering , everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever , and that the Royal_Academy_of_Music must now have the manuscript in_order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited . 
6803	br-k08	27	59	154839	Rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite , standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance . 
6804	br-k08	27	60	154864	The ladies especially could n't understand what troubled him . 
6805	br-k08	27	61	154874	A contradiction ? 
6806	br-k08	27	62	154877	Bah , what was a contradiction in one 's life ? 
6807	br-k08	27	63	154888	Every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes , and saying yes when she meant no . 
6808	br-k08	28	64	154910	Rousseau had_to admit that though he could n't agree to a public performance , he would indeed , just for his own private satisfaction , dearly love to know how his work would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices . 
6809	br-k08	29	65	154954	`` I 'd simply like to know if it is as_good_as you kind people seem to think '' , he said . 
6810	br-k08	30	66	154976	Duclos , the historian , pointed_out to Jean_Jacques that this was impossible . 
6811	br-k08	30	67	154989	The musicians of the Royal_Opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound . 
6812	br-k08	30	68	155007	Merely to satisfy the author 's curiosity . 
6813	br-k08	31	69	155015	Rousseau agreed . 
6814	br-k08	31	70	155018	But he recalled that Rameau had once had a private performance of his opera Armide , behind closed doors , just for himself alone . 
6815	br-k08	32	71	155043	Duclos understood what was bothering Rousseau : that the writer of the Prosopopoeia_of_Fabricius should now become known as the writer of an amusing little operetta . 
6816	br-k08	32	72	155069	That would certainly be paradoxical . 
6817	br-k08	32	73	155075	But Duclos thought he saw a way_out . 
6818	br-k08	33	74	155083	`` Let me do the submitting to the Royal_Academy '' , he suggested . 
6819	br-k08	33	75	155097	`` Your name will never appear . 
6820	br-k08	33	76	155104	No_one will even suspect that it is your work '' . 
6821	br-k08	34	77	155115	To_that Rousseau could agree . 
6822	br-k08	35	78	155120	But now what crazy twists and turns of his emotions ! 
6823	br-k08	36	79	155131	Afraid at one_and_the_same time that his work might be turned_down - which would be a blow to his pride even_though no_one knew he was the author - and that the work would be accepted , and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in_spite_of himself . 
6824	br-k08	36	80	155186	And how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause ! 
6825	br-k08	36	81	155197	And thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity , Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks . 
6826	br-k08	37	82	155233	All these emotions were screwed_up to new heights when , after acceptance and the first rehearsals , there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian music_lovers that Duclos had_to come running to Rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King 's amusements , and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau . 
6827	br-k08	37	83	155303	Imagine the honor of_it ! 
6828	br-k08	38	84	155308	`` What was your answer '' ? 
6829	br-k08	38	85	155315	Jean_Jacques asked , striving to appear unimpressed . 
6830	br-k08	39	86	155323	`` I refused '' , Duclos said . 
6831	br-k08	39	87	155331	`` What else could I do ? 
6832	br-k08	39	88	155338	Monsieur_de_Cury was incensed , of_course . 
6833	br-k08	39	89	155344	But I said I would first have_to get the author 's permission . 
6834	br-k08	39	90	155357	And I was certain he would refuse '' . 
6835	br-k08	40	91	155366	How infuriating all this was ! 
6836	br-k08	40	92	155372	Why had not this success come to him before he had plunged into his Discourse , and before he had committed himself to a life of austerity and denial ? 
6837	br-k08	40	93	155402	Now , when everything was opening_up to him - even the court of Louis_/_15 15 , ! 
6838	br-k08	40	94	155419	- he had_to play a role of self-effacement . 
6839	br-k08	41	95	155428	Back_and_forth Duclos had_to go , between M._de_Cury and Jean_Jacques and between the Duke_d'Aumont and Jean_Jacques again , as his little operetta , The_Village_Soothsayer , though still unperformed , took_on ever more importance . 
6840	br-k08	42	96	155461	And of_course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get_around among his closest friends . 
6841	br-k08	42	97	155480	But they , naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at_large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles . 
6842	br-k08	43	98	155506	How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals . 
6843	br-k08	43	99	155544	The furor was such_that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational . 
6844	br-k08	43	100	155577	And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe , Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration , trembling lest his authorship become known , and at_the_same_time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer . 
6845	br-k08	44	101	155629	He felt himself now , as he himself says in his Confessions , at a crucial point of his life . 
6846	br-k08	44	102	155650	And that was why , on the day of the performance , when a carriage from the royal stables called to take him to the palace , he did not bother to shave . 
6847	br-k08	44	103	155684	On_the_contrary , he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days . 
6848	br-k08	45	104	155699	Seeing him in that condition , and about to enter the hall where the King , the Queen , the whole royal_family and all the members of the highest aristocracy would be present , Grimm and the Abbe_Raynal and_others tried to stop him . 
6849	br-k08	46	105	155743	`` You can n't go_in that way '' ! they cried . 
6850	br-k08	47	106	155755	`` Why not '' ? 
6851	br-k08	47	107	155760	Jean_Jacques asked . 
6852	br-k08	47	108	155763	`` Who is going_to stop me '' ? 
6853	br-k08	48	109	155771	`` You have n't dressed for the occasion '' ! they pointed_out to him . 
6854	br-k08	49	110	155786	`` I'm dressed as I always am '' , Rousseau said . 
6855	br-k08	49	111	155798	`` Neither better nor worse '' . 
6856	br-k08	50	112	155805	`` At home , yes '' , they argued . 
6857	br-k08	50	113	155815	`` But here you are in the palace . 
6858	br-k08	50	114	155824	There 's the King . 
6859	br-k08	50	115	155829	And Madame_de_Pompadour '' . 
6860	br-k08	51	116	155833	`` If they are here , then surely I have the right to be here '' , Rousseau said . 
6861	br-k08	51	117	155853	`` And even more right . 
6862	br-k08	51	118	155859	Since I am the composer '' ! 
6863	br-k08	52	119	155866	`` But in such a slovenly condition '' . 
6864	br-k08	53	120	155875	`` What is slovenly about me '' ? 
6865	br-k08	53	121	155883	Rousseau asked . 
6866	br-k08	53	122	155886	`` Is it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my face ? 
6867	br-k08	53	123	155900	Surely it would grow there whether I washed myself or not . 
6868	br-k08	53	124	155912	A_hundred years ago I would have worn a beard with_pride . 
6869	br-k08	53	125	155923	And those without beards would have stood_out as not dressed for the occasion . 
6870	br-k08	53	126	155937	Now times have changed , and I must pretend that hair does n't grow on my face . 
6871	br-k08	53	127	155955	That 's the fashion . 
6872	br-k08	53	128	155960	And fashion is the real king here . 
6873	br-k08	53	129	155968	Not Louis_/_15 , , since even he obeys . 
6874	br-k08	53	130	155977	Now , if you do n't mind , I should_like to hear my own piece performed '' . 
6875	br-k08	54	131	155995	But of_course behind his boldness he did n't feel bold at_all . 
6876	br-k08	54	132	156007	He trembled lest his piece should fail . 
6877	br-k08	54	133	156015	And this in_addition to his usual fear of being among people of high_society . 
6878	br-k08	54	134	156029	His fear of making some inane or inappropriate remark . 
6879	br-k08	54	135	156039	And even deeper than that : 
6880	br-k08	54	136	156045	his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve_himself . 
6881	br-k08	54	137	156059	Could he walk out in_the_midst of his piece ? 
6882	br-k08	54	138	156068	Here , before the court ? 
6883	br-k08	54	139	156074	Before the King ? 
6884	br-k09	1	1	156078	It was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began . 
6885	br-k09	2	2	156093	The rider from Concord was as_good_as his word . 
6886	br-k09	2	3	156102	He came spurring and whooping down the road , his horse kicking_up clouds of dust , shouting : 
6887	br-k09	3	4	156120	`` They 're a-coming ! 
6888	br-k09	3	5	156125	By God , they 're a-coming , they are '' ! 
6889	br-k09	4	6	156136	We heard him before he ever showed , and we heard him yelling after he was out_of_sight . 
6890	br-k09	4	7	156154	Solomon_Chandler had n't misjudged the strength of his lungs , not at all . 
6891	br-k09	4	8	156168	I think you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every seam with importance . 
6892	br-k09	4	9	156189	I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man , and when a very small man is up on a saddle , he 'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there . 
6893	br-k09	4	10	156230	That 's understandable , and I appreciate the sentiment . 
6894	br-k09	4	11	156240	As for this rider , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes , I can n't say ; but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction . 
6895	br-k09	4	12	156287	The last thing in_the_world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone_wall , and this dashing rider made us feel a good_deal sharper and more alert to the situation . 
6896	br-k09	5	13	156328	We came_down off the wall as if he had toppled all_of us , and we crouched behind it . 
6897	br-k09	5	14	156347	I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a_lot of people talk_about things of which they are deplorably ignorant . 
6898	br-k09	5	15	156376	Whatever we felt about the redcoats , we respected them in_terms_of their trade , which was killing ; and I know that I , myself , was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun . 
6899	br-k09	5	16	156421	I wanted to wipe my flint , but I did n't dare to , the state my hands were in , just as I did n't dare to do anything about the priming . 
6900	br-k09	5	17	156455	The gun would fire or not , just as chance willed . 
6901	br-k09	5	18	156467	I put a_lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun , because the most important thing I had learned about war was that you could run_away and survive to talk_about it . 
6902	br-k09	6	19	156502	The gunfire , which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now , stopped for long enough to count to twenty ; and in that brief interval , a redcoat officer came tearing down the road , whipping his horse fit to kill . 
6903	br-k09	6	20	156551	I do n't know whether he was_after our rider , who had gone_by a minute before , or whether he was simply scouting conditions ; but when he passed us by , a musket roared , and he reared his horse , swung it around , and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come . 
6904	br-k09	6	21	156612	He was a fine and showy rider , but his skill was wasted on us . 
6905	br-k09	6	22	156628	From above me and somewhere behind me , a rifle cracked . 
6906	br-k09	6	23	156640	The redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster , and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle , except that one booted foot caught in the stirrup . 
6907	br-k09	6	24	156670	Half crazed by the weight dragging , the dust , and the heat , the horse leaped our wall , dashing out the rider 's brains against it , and leaving him lying there among us - while the horse crashed away through the brush . 
6908	br-k09	7	25	156716	It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays ; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from me , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become . 
6909	br-k09	8	26	156767	And now the redcoats were coming , and the gunfire was a part of the dust_cloud on the road to the west of us . 
6910	br-k09	8	27	156792	I must state that the faster things happened , the slower they happened ; the passage and rhythm of time changed , and when I remember back to what happened then , each event is a separate and frozen incident . 
6911	br-k09	8	28	156833	In my recollection , there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats , and in that interval the dust_cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely . 
6912	br-k09	8	29	156873	Yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds , and then the front of the British army came into view . 
6913	br-k09	9	30	156898	It was only hours since I had last seen them , but they had changed and I had changed . 
6914	br-k09	9	31	156918	In the very front rank , two men were wounded and staggered along , trailing blood behind them . 
6915	br-k09	9	32	156937	No drummers here , no pipers , and the red_coats were covered with a fine film of dust . 
6916	br-k09	9	33	156956	They marched with bayonets fixed , and as fixed on their faces was anger , fear , and torment . 
6917	br-k09	9	34	156976	Rank after rank of them came_down the road , and the faces were all the same , and they walked in a sea of dust . 
6918	br-k09	10	35	157002	`` Committeemen , hold your fire ! 
6919	br-k09	10	36	157009	Hold your fire '' ! 
6920	br-k09	10	37	157014	a voice called , and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant , only some of them glancing toward the stone_wall , from behind which the voice came . 
6921	br-k09	11	38	157054	The front of their column had already passed us , when another officer came riding down the side of the road , not five paces from where we were . 
6922	br-k09	11	39	157084	My Cousin_Simmons carried a musket , but he had loaded it with bird_shot , and as the officer came opposite him , he rose_up behind the wall and fired . 
6923	br-k09	11	40	157114	One moment there was a man in the saddle ; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks , and during the next second or two , we all_of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers . 
6924	br-k09	11	41	157159	One moment , the road was filled with disciplined troops , marching four by four with a purpose as implacable as death ; the next , a cloud of gun_smoke covered a screaming fury of sound , out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury . 
6925	br-k09	12	42	157211	In the course of_this , they had fired on us ; but I have no memory of_that . 
6926	br-k09	12	43	157229	I had squeezed the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fired and kicked_back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule ; and then I was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound , hurling more vile language than I ever thought I knew , sobbing and shouting , and aware that if I had passed_water before , it was not enough , for my pants were soaking wet . 
6927	br-k09	13	44	157310	I would have stood there and died there if left to myself , but Cousin_Simmons grabbed my arm in his viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there ; and_then I came_to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I outdistanced Cousin_Simmons by_far . 
6928	br-k09	13	45	157358	Everyone else was running . 
6929	br-k09	13	46	157363	Later we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall . 
6930	br-k09	13	47	157377	Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching . 
6931	br-k09	14	48	157392	We tumbled to a stop in Deacon_Gordon 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle . 
6932	br-k09	14	49	157418	A dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped_up handfuls of_it . 
6933	br-k09	14	50	157485	Isaac_Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket_ball in his belly ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow . 
6934	br-k09	14	51	157536	It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no_one had time to spend sympathizing_with poor Isaac - except the Reverend . 
6935	br-k09	14	52	157560	I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket_ball , as Isaac had been , yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself . 
6936	br-k09	14	53	157605	I was drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road , and the fact that I was not afraid now , but only waiting to know what to do next . 
6937	br-k09	15	54	157643	Meanwhile , I reloaded my gun , as the other men were doing . 
6938	br-k09	15	55	157657	We were less than a quarter of a mile from the road , and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it . 
6939	br-k09	15	56	157689	Wherever you looked , you saw Committeemen running across the meadows , some away from the road , some toward it , some parallel to it ; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at_least fifty militia were making their way in our direction . 
6940	br-k09	16	57	157737	Cousin_Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington and take_up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column , but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road . 
6941	br-k09	16	58	157776	I did n't offer any advice , but I certainly did not want to go_back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out . 
6942	br-k09	16	59	157802	Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the_British would be gone ; but Cousin_Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning , and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass , what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts . 
6943	br-k09	17	60	157868	While this was being discussed , we saw the militia to the west of us fanning_out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road . 
6944	br-k09	17	61	157900	It was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the Committeemen who had been in the Battle_of_the_North_Bridge , which entitled them to a sort of veteran status , and we felt that if they employed this tactic , it was likely enough the best one . 
6945	br-k09	17	62	157951	Mattathias_Dover said : 
6946	br-k09	18	63	157954	`` It makes_sense . 
6947	br-k09	18	64	157958	If we cluster together , the redcoats can make an advantage out of_it , but there 's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us , and we can outrun them '' . 
6948	br-k09	19	65	157999	That settled it , and we broke into parties of two and three . 
6949	br-k09	19	66	158013	Cousin_Joshua_Dover decided to remain with the Reverend and poor Isaac_Pitt until life passed_away - and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world . 
6950	br-k09	19	67	158043	I went_off with Cousin_Simmons , who maintained that if he did n't see to me , he did n't know who would . 
6951	br-k09	20	68	158066	`` Good_heavens , Adam '' , he said , `` I thought one thing you 'd have no trouble learning is when to get_out of a place '' . 
6952	br-k09	21	69	158095	`` I learned that now '' , I said . 
6953	br-k09	22	70	158105	We ran east for about half a mile before we turned_back to the road , panting from the effort and soaked with sweat . 
6954	br-k09	22	71	158129	There was a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up_to the road , and the shouting and gunfire never slackened . 
6955	br-k09	23	72	158153	Under the trees , there was a dead redcoat , a young boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimples , who had taken a rifle_ball directly between the eyes . 
6956	br-k09	23	73	158188	Three men were around him . 
6957	br-k09	23	74	158194	They had stripped him of his musket and equipment , and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off . 
6958	br-k09	23	75	158215	Cousin_Simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away . 
6959	br-k09	24	76	158228	`` God's_name , what are you to rob the dead with the fight going_on '' ! 
6960	br-k09	24	77	158244	Cousin_Simmons roared . 
6961	br-k09	25	78	158247	They tried to outface him , but Joseph_Simmons was as wide as two average men , and it would have taken braver men than these were to outface him . 
6962	br-k10	1	1	158277	That summer the gambling_houses were closed , despite the threats of Pierre_Ameaux , a gaming-card manufacturer . 
6963	br-k10	1	2	158294	Dancing was no_longer permitted in the streets . 
6964	br-k10	1	3	158302	The Bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied . 
6965	br-k10	1	4	158312	The slit breeches had_to go . 
6966	br-k10	1	5	158318	Drunkenness was no_longer tolerated . 
6967	br-k10	1	6	158323	In defiance , a chinless reprobate , Jake_Camaret , marched down the aisle in St._Peter 's one Sunday morning , followed by one of the women from the Bordel , whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any shame . 
6968	br-k10	1	7	158365	Plunking themselves down on the front bench , they turned to smirk at those around them . 
6969	br-k10	2	8	158382	John 's first impulse was to denounce their blasphemy . 
6970	br-k10	2	9	158392	But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him . 
6971	br-k10	2	10	158409	Calmly he opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well . 
6972	br-k10	2	11	158423	He finished the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor God and man . 
6973	br-k10	3	12	158442	The next morning , as the clock struck nine , he appeared at the Council meeting in the Town_Hall and insisted that the couple would have_to be punished if the Church was to be respected . 
6974	br-k10	4	13	158478	`` I have told you before , and I tell you again '' , Monsieur_Favre said rudely . 
6975	br-k10	4	14	158496	`` Stick_to the preaching of the Gospel '' ! 
6976	br-k10	5	15	158505	John stiffened in anger . 
6977	br-k10	5	16	158510	`` That is the answer the ungodly will always make when the Church points its fingers at their sins . 
6978	br-k10	5	17	158530	I say to you that the Church will ever decry evil '' ! 
6979	br-k10	6	18	158543	John 's reply was like a declaration of war . 
6980	br-k10	6	19	158553	Monsieur_Favre sat_down in his high-backed stall , lips compressed , eyes glinting . 
6981	br-k10	6	20	158566	Ablard_Corne , a short man with a rotunda of stomach , rose . 
6982	br-k10	6	21	158579	Every eye was on him as he began to speak . 
6983	br-k10	7	22	158590	`` What Master_Calvin says is true . 
6984	br-k10	7	23	158597	How can we have a good city unless we respect morality '' ? 
6985	br-k10	8	24	158610	Abel_Poupin , a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes , got_to_his_feet . 
6986	br-k10	8	25	158624	`` We all know that Jake_Camaret and the woman are brazenly living together . 
6987	br-k10	8	26	158638	It would be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterers '' . 
6988	br-k10	9	27	158653	Philibert_Berthelier , the son of the famous patriot , disagreed . 
6989	br-k10	9	28	158664	`` Do not listen to that Frenchman . 
6990	br-k10	9	29	158672	He is throttling the liberty my father gave his life to win '' ! 
6991	br-k10	10	30	158686	John was quietly insistent . 
6992	br-k10	10	31	158691	`` There can be no compromise when souls are in jeopardy '' . 
6993	br-k10	11	32	158704	A week later the sentence of the Council was carried_out : Jake_Camaret and the woman were marched naked through the streets past a mocking populace . 
6994	br-k10	11	33	158730	Before them stalked the beadle , proclaiming as he went , `` Thus the Council deals with those who break its laws - adulterers , thieves , murderers , and lewd persons . 
6995	br-k10	11	34	158763	Let evildoers contemplate their ways , and let every man beware '' ! 
6996	br-k10	12	35	158776	John 's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just received from his sister Mary . 
6997	br-k10	12	36	158798	Charles had died two_weeks before , in early November , without being reconciled to the Church . 
6998	br-k10	12	37	158815	The canons , in a body , had tried to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last_rites of the Church , but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith . 
6999	br-k10	12	38	158851	Burial had taken_place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet , so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug_up and burned . 
7000	br-k10	12	39	158883	The Abbot of St._Eloi , Claude_de_Mommor , had been a good friend , but not even he thought Charles deserved burial in hallowed ground . 
7001	br-k10	13	40	158908	John closed his eyes and saw once_again the little niche in his mother 's bedroom , where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs . 
7002	br-k10	13	41	158937	The blue draped Virgin was still there , but no_one knelt before her now . 
7003	br-k10	13	42	158952	Not even Varnessa ; she , too , prayed only to God . 
7004	br-k10	13	43	158965	For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells of Noyon-la-Sainte , the touch of his mother 's hand , the lilt of Charles 's voice in the square raftered rooms , his father 's bass tones rumbling to the canons , and the sight of the beloved bishop . 
7005	br-k10	13	44	159017	But he had_to follow the light . 
7006	br-k10	13	45	159024	Unless God expected a man to believe the Holy_Scriptures , why had He given them to him ? 
7007	br-k10	14	46	159042	The white clad trees stood like specters in the February night . 
7008	br-k10	14	47	159054	Snow buried the streets and covered the slanting rooftops , as John trudged toward St._Peter 's . 
7009	br-k10	14	48	159071	A carriage crunched by , its dim lights filtering through the gloom . 
7010	br-k10	14	49	159084	The sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated the holes of his shoes , his only ones , now patched with folded parchment . 
7011	br-k10	14	50	159116	The city had recently given him a small salary , but it was not enough to supply even necessities . 
7012	br-k10	15	51	159136	As he neared the square , a round figure muffled in a long , black cape whisked_by . 
7013	br-k10	15	52	159154	John recognized Ablard_Corne and called_out a greeting . 
7014	br-k10	15	53	159162	How grateful he was to such men ! 
7015	br-k10	15	54	159170	There were several on the Council who tried to live like Christians . 
7016	br-k10	15	55	159183	Despite their efforts , the problems seemed to grow graver all_the_time . 
7017	br-k10	15	56	159195	Quickening his steps , John entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells . 
7018	br-k10	15	57	159213	Underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the Clemence , two gray and white birds slept huddled_together in the cold winter air . 
7019	br-k10	16	58	159250	John leaned upon the stone balustrade . 
7020	br-k10	16	59	159257	He brushed back his black hair , shoving it under his pastor 's cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes . 
7021	br-k10	16	60	159280	Below the moon_splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks ; above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars . 
7022	br-k10	16	61	159301	He stood very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the heavens , then down at the blinking lights below . 
7023	br-k10	17	62	159326	`` How long , my Lord ? 
7024	br-k10	17	63	159333	How long ? 
7025	br-k10	17	64	159336	I have never asked for an easy task , but I am weary of the strife '' . 
7026	br-k10	18	65	159354	Sleep was difficult these days . 
7027	br-k10	18	66	159360	Indigestion plagued him . 
7028	br-k10	18	67	159364	Severe headaches were frequent . 
7029	br-k10	18	68	159369	Loneliness tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought_of Peter_Robert , Nerien , Nicholas_Cop , Martin_Bucer , and even the compromising Louis_du_Tillet . 
7030	br-k10	18	69	159394	An occasional traveler from Italy brought news of Peter_Robert , who was now distributing his Bible among the Waldensian peasants . 
7031	br-k10	18	70	159415	Letters came regularly from Nerien , Nicholas , and Martin . 
7032	br-k10	18	71	159426	He had Anthony and William to confide in and consult . 
7033	br-k10	18	72	159437	But William continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and tearing_down symbols sacred to the Old_Church . 
7034	br-k10	18	73	159456	John found it difficult , but he held him in check . 
7035	br-k10	18	74	159468	And Anthony was busy most of the time courting this girl and that . 
7036	br-k10	18	75	159482	His easy good_looks made him a favorite with the ladies . 
7037	br-k10	19	76	159493	Geneva , instead of becoming the City_of_God , as John had dreamed , had in the two years since he had been there , continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished . 
7038	br-k10	19	77	159530	Refugees poured in , signing the Confession and rules in_order to remain , and then disregarding them . 
7039	br-k10	19	78	159548	Dice rolled , prostitutes plied their trade , thieves stole , murderers stabbed , and the ungodly blasphemed . 
7040	br-k10	19	79	159567	Catholics who were truly Christians longed for the simple penance of days gone_by . 
7041	br-k10	19	80	159581	Libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded : `` Are we going_to allow the Protestant_Pope , Master_Calvin , to curtail our liberty ? 
7042	br-k10	19	81	159606	Why , oh why , does n't he stick_to preaching the Gospel , instead of meddling in civic affairs , politics , economics , and social issues that are no concern of the Church '' ? 
7043	br-k10	19	82	159642	And John 's reply was always the same : `` Anything that affects souls is the concern of the Church ! 
7044	br-k10	19	83	159663	We will have righteousness '' ! 
7045	br-k10	20	84	159669	Tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight . 
7046	br-k10	20	85	159681	Unless the confusion cleared , he would not be coming here much longer . 
7047	br-k10	20	86	159695	Monsieur_Favre 's threat would become a reality , for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of `` that Frenchman '' . 
7048	br-k10	21	87	159721	The slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his reverie . 
7049	br-k10	21	88	159740	Faint at_first , the tapping grew until it sounded loud against the wind . 
7050	br-k10	21	89	159754	Eli_Corault ! 
7051	br-k10	21	90	159756	John thought . 
7052	br-k10	21	91	159759	What is he doing here at this hour ? 
7053	br-k10	21	92	159768	He started down the steps to meet the near-blind preacher , who had been one of the early Gospelers in Paris . 
7054	br-k10	22	93	159790	`` John ? 
7055	br-k10	22	94	159793	Is that you ? 
7056	br-k10	22	95	159797	I came to warn you of a plot '' ! 
7057	br-k10	23	96	159807	John stood above him , his face ashen . 
7058	br-k10	23	97	159816	What now ? 
7059	br-k10	23	98	159819	Slowly , like a man grown old , he took Eli 's hand and led him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned . 
7060	br-k10	24	99	159856	`` Plot '' ? 
7061	br-k10	24	100	159860	John asked tiredly . 
7062	br-k10	25	101	159864	`` Monsieur_Favre just paid me a visit . 
7063	br-k10	25	102	159872	I went_to your rooms , and Anthony told me you were here . 
7064	br-k10	25	103	159885	Two Anabaptists , Caroli and Benoit , are to challenge you and William to a debate before the Council . 
7065	br-k10	25	104	159905	It is to be a trap . 
7066	br-k10	25	105	159912	You know the law : if you lose the debate after accepting a challenge , you will be banished '' ! 
7067	br-k10	26	106	159933	`` What will be the subject '' ? 
7068	br-k10	27	107	159941	`` You are to be accused of Arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal '' . 
7069	br-k10	28	108	159958	Anger and fear fused in John . 
7070	br-k10	28	109	159965	Ever since the fourth century a controversy had raged over the person of Christ . 
7071	br-k10	28	110	159980	Those who refused to believe that He was the eternal Son of God were termed Arianists . 
7072	br-k10	28	111	159997	Peter_Caroli had come to Geneva , saying that he had been a bishop of the Church_of_Rome and had been persecuted in Paris for his Reformed faith . 
7073	br-k10	28	112	160024	He asked to be appointed a preacher . 
7074	br-k10	28	113	160032	But Michael_Sept had unmasked him , revealing he had never been a bishop , but was an Anabaptist , afraid to state his faith , because he knew John_Calvin had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death . 
7075	br-k10	28	114	160075	So John had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher , and now Caroli sought revenge . 
7076	br-k10	29	115	160094	John sighed . 
7077	br-k10	29	116	160097	`` If William agrees , we should insist on a public_debate '' , he said at_length . 
7078	br-k10	30	117	160114	`` There is more to the conspiracy . 
7079	br-k10	30	118	160122	Bern demands that the Lord's_Supper be administered here as it used_to be , with unleavened_bread . 
7080	br-k10	30	119	160138	Furthermore , Bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the Council , preach only the word_of_God and stop meddling in politics '' ! 
7081	br-k10	31	120	160165	`` It was always the spirit with Christ ; matters such_as leavened or unleavened_bread are inconsequential . 
7082	br-k10	31	121	160182	Geneva must remain a sovereign state . 
7083	br-k10	31	122	160189	We will not yield to the demands of Bern '' ! 
7084	br-k10	32	123	160200	The firelight played over Eli 's flowing white locks and rugged features . 
7085	br-k10	32	124	160213	`` Monsieur_Favre indicated that if I would co-operate , after you and William are banished , following the debate , I will be given a place of influence '' . 
7086	br-k10	33	125	160243	`` What was your reply to that '' ? 
7087	br-k10	34	126	160252	`` That I would rather be banished with two such Christians than be made the Chief_Syndic '' ! 
7088	br-k10	35	127	160270	The following morning , as John entered the Place_Molard on his way to visit a sick refugee , he had a premonition of danger . 
7089	br-k10	35	128	160295	Then suddenly a group of men and dogs circled him . 
7090	br-k10	35	129	160306	He wanted to run , but he knew that if he did , he would be lost . 
7091	br-k10	35	130	160324	He stood very still , his heart thumping wildly . 
7092	br-k10	35	131	160334	On the outskirts of the rabble the Camaret brothers and Gaspard_Favre shook their fists . 
7093	br-k10	36	132	160349	`` Are you going_to comply with the demands of Bern '' ? 
7094	br-k10	36	133	160361	the chinless Jake called . 
7095	br-k10	37	134	160366	`` Arianist '' ! a rowdy with a big blob of a nose roared . 
7096	br-k10	37	135	160381	`` Heretic '' ! 
7097	br-k10	38	136	160385	John lifted his hand for silence . 
7098	br-k10	38	137	160392	`` Know this : the ministers will not yield to the demands of Bern '' . 
7099	br-k10	38	138	160408	His voice shook a_little . 
7100	br-k10	39	139	160413	Somebody heaved a stone . 
7101	br-k10	39	140	160418	For an instant John was stunned . 
7102	br-k10	40	141	160425	When he felt the side of his head , his fingers came_away covered with blood . 
7103	br-k10	40	142	160441	Before he could duck , another stone struck him . 
7104	br-k10	40	143	160451	And another . 
7105	br-k10	41	144	160454	`` let him be now '' ! 
7106	br-k10	41	145	160461	Pierre_Ameaux , the gaming-card manufacturer said , his little pig eyes glaring . 
7107	br-k10	41	146	160474	`` We have taught him a lesson '' . 
7108	br-k10	42	147	160483	The crowd moved_back and John started dizzily down the hill . 
7109	br-k10	42	148	160494	Fists pummeled him as he staggered forward . 
7110	br-k10	42	149	160502	Then he slipped and went_down on his hands and knees in the melting snow . 
7111	br-k10	42	150	160517	At_once a bevy of dogs was snapping and snarling around him . 
7112	br-k10	42	151	160529	One , more horrible than the rest , lunged , growling deep in his throat , his hair bristling . 
7113	br-k10	42	152	160549	With great difficulty John clambered to his feet and started to run , sweat pouring down his face . 
7114	br-k11	1	1	160568	Standing in the shelter of the tent - a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped , no_longer drumming - Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beef barrels . 
7115	br-k11	1	2	160610	There was , of_course , no real need to rearrange everything . 
7116	br-k11	1	3	160622	A quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake , or the toffee , or the barley sugar , or the sardines , or the bitters , or the condensed_milk , or the stationery , or the needles - what could it mean ? 
7117	br-k11	1	4	160667	Adam watched his own hands make the caressing , anxious movement that , when rain falls and nobody comes , and ruin draws_close like a cat rubbing against the ankles , has been the ritual of stall vendors , forever . 
7118	br-k11	2	5	160708	He recognized the gesture . 
7119	br-k11	2	6	160713	He knew its meaning . 
7120	br-k11	2	7	160718	He had seen a dry , old , yellowing hand reach_out , with that painful solicitude , to touch , to rearrange , to shift aimlessly , some object worth a pfennig . 
7121	br-k11	2	8	160751	Back in Bavaria he had seen that gesture , and at that sight his heart had always died within him . 
7122	br-k11	2	9	160772	On such occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand , whatever face it might be . 
7123	br-k11	3	10	160796	Now the face was his own . 
7124	br-k11	3	11	160803	He wondered what expression , as he made that gesture , was on his face . 
7125	br-k11	3	12	160819	He wondered if it wore the old anxiety , or the old , taut stoicism . 
7126	br-k11	3	13	160835	But there was no need , he remembered , for his hand to reach_out , for his face to show concern or stoicism . 
7127	br-k11	3	14	160859	It was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came . 
7128	br-k11	3	15	160871	Then why was he assuming the role - the gesture and the suffering ? 
7129	br-k11	3	16	160885	What was he expiating ? 
7130	br-k11	3	17	160890	Or was he now taking the role - the gesture and the suffering - because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid , befogged loneliness of this land . 
7131	br-k11	4	18	160926	This was Virginia . 
7132	br-k11	5	19	160930	He looked_out of the tent at the company street . 
7133	br-k11	5	20	160940	The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street . 
7134	br-k11	5	21	160951	Beyond that misty gray of the rain , he saw the stretching hutment , low diminutive log_cabins , chinked with mud , with doorways a man would have_to crouch to get through , with roofs of tenting laid_over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes , or fence_rails , with cranky chimneys of sticks and dried mud . 
7135	br-k11	5	22	161008	The chimney of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked_out . 
7136	br-k11	5	23	161026	In this heavy air , however , that device did not seem to help . 
7137	br-k11	5	24	161041	The smoke from that chimney rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other , and hung as sadly in the drizzle , creeping back_down along the sopping canvas of the roof . 
7138	br-k11	6	25	161073	Over the door was a board with large , inept lettering : 
7139	br-k11	6	26	161085	Home_Sweet_Home . 
7140	br-k11	6	27	161087	This was the hut of Simms_Purdew , the hero . 
7141	br-k11	7	28	161097	The men were huddled in those lairs . 
7142	br-k11	7	29	161105	Adam knew the names of some . 
7143	br-k11	7	30	161112	He knew the faces of all , hairy or shaven , old or young , fat or thin , suffering or hardened , sad or gay , good or bad . 
7144	br-k11	7	31	161143	When they stood about his tent , chaffing each other , exchanging their obscenities , cursing command or weather , he had studied their faces . 
7145	br-k11	7	32	161169	He had had the need to understand what life lurked behind the mask of flesh , behind the oath , the banter , the sadness . 
7146	br-k11	7	33	161195	Once covertly looking at Simms_Purdew , the only man in the world whom he hated , he had seen the heavy , slack , bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel , obscene banter , and had seen the pale blue eyes go watery with whisky and merriment , and suddenly he was not seeing the face of that vile creature . 
7147	br-k11	7	34	161259	He was seeing , somehow , the face of a young boy , the boy Simms_Purdew must once have been , a boy with sorrel hair , and blue eyes dancing with gaiety , and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles . 
7148	br-k11	8	35	161303	In that moment of vision Adam heard the voice within himself saying : I must not hate him , I must not hate him or I shall die . 
7149	br-k11	9	36	161332	His heart suddenly opened to joy . 
7150	br-k11	10	37	161339	He thought that if once , only once , he could talk with Simms_Purdew , something about his own life , and all life , would be clear and simple . 
7151	br-k11	10	38	161370	If Simms_Purdew would turn_to him and say : `` Adam , you know when I was a boy , it was a funny thing happened . 
7152	br-k11	10	39	161396	Lemme tell you now '' - 
7153	br-k11	11	40	161402	If only Simms_Purdew could do that , whatever the thing he remembered and told . 
7154	br-k11	11	41	161417	It would be a sign for the untellable , and he , Adam , would understand . 
7155	br-k11	12	42	161434	Now , Adam , in the gray light of afternoon , stared across at the hut opposite his tent , and thought_of Simms_Purdew lying in there in the gloom , snoring on his bunk , with the fumes of whisky choking the air . 
7156	br-k11	12	43	161478	He saw the sign above the door of the hut : Home_Sweet_Home . 
7157	br-k11	12	44	161491	He saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street , with an armful of wood . 
7158	br-k11	13	45	161513	It was Pullen_James , the campmate of Simms_Purdew . 
7159	br-k11	13	46	161522	He carried the wood , carried the water , did the cooking , cleaning and mending , and occasionally got a kick_in_the_butt for his pains . 
7160	br-k11	13	47	161548	Adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho . 
7161	br-k11	13	48	161557	It gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam , like metal . 
7162	br-k11	13	49	161569	Pullen_James humbly lowered his head , pushed_aside the hardtack box door of the hut , and was gone from sight . 
7163	br-k11	14	50	161590	Adam stared at the door and remembered that Simms_Purdew had been awarded the Medal_of_Honor for gallantry at Antietam . 
7164	br-k11	15	51	161609	The street was again empty . 
7165	br-k11	15	52	161615	The drizzle was slacking_off now , but the light was grayer . 
7166	br-k11	15	53	161627	With enormous interest , Adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him . 
7167	br-k11	15	54	161649	Into the emptiness of the street , and his spirit , moved a form . 
7168	br-k11	16	55	161664	The form was swathed in an army blanket , much patched , fastened at the neck with a cord . 
7169	br-k11	16	56	161684	From under the shapeless huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud . 
7170	br-k11	16	57	161698	The feet wore army shoes , in obvious disrepair . 
7171	br-k11	16	58	161708	The head was wrapped in a turban and on top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of poncho had been flung . 
7172	br-k11	16	59	161735	The gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle . 
7173	br-k11	16	60	161745	Moisture ran_down the cheeks , gathered at the tip of the nose , and at the chin . 
7174	br-k11	16	61	161763	The figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching to dislodge the drop clinging there . 
7175	br-k11	16	62	161783	The figure stopped and one hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose . 
7176	br-k11	16	63	161800	Then the figure moved_on . 
7177	br-k11	17	64	161805	This was one of the Irish women who had built their own huts down near the river . 
7178	br-k11	17	65	161823	They did washing . 
7179	br-k11	17	66	161827	Adam recognized this one . 
7180	br-k11	17	67	161832	He recognized her because she was the one who , in a winter twilight , on the edge of camp , had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly . 
7181	br-k11	17	68	161867	`` Slice o_' mutton , bhoy '' ? she had queried in her soft guttural . 
7182	br-k11	17	69	161883	`` Slice o_' mutton '' ? 
7183	br-k11	18	70	161889	Her name was Mollie . 
7184	br-k11	18	71	161894	They called her Mollie_the_Mutton , and laughed . 
7185	br-k11	18	72	161902	Looking down the street after her , Adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the basket . 
7186	br-k11	18	73	161925	He could not make_out , but he knew that again she was scratching her nose . 
7187	br-k11	18	74	161941	Mollie_the_Mutton was scratching her nose . 
7188	br-k11	19	75	161947	The words ran crazily in his head : Mollie_the_Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain . 
7189	br-k11	20	76	161964	Then the words fell_into a pattern : `` Mollie_the_Mutton is scratching her nose , Scratching her nose in the rain . 
7190	br-k11	20	77	161985	Mollie_the_Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain '' . 
7191	br-k11	21	78	161995	The pattern would not stop . 
7192	br-k11	21	79	162001	It came again_and_again . 
7193	br-k11	21	80	162005	He felt trapped in that pattern , in the repetition . 
7194	br-k11	22	81	162016	Suddenly he thought he might weep . 
7195	br-k11	22	82	162023	`` What 's the_matter with me '' ? he demanded out_loud . 
7196	br-k11	22	83	162035	He looked wildly around , at the now empty street , at the mud , at the rain . 
7197	br-k11	22	84	162054	`` Oh , what 's the_matter with me '' ? he demanded . 
7198	br-k11	23	85	162067	When he had stored his stock in the great oak chest , locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain , tied the fly of the tent , and picked_up the cash box , he moved_up the darkening street . 
7199	br-k11	23	86	162109	He would consign the cash box into the hands of Jed_Hawksworth , then stand_by while his employer checked the contents and the list of items sold . 
7200	br-k11	23	87	162136	Then he - 
7201	br-k11	24	88	162139	Then what ? 
7202	br-k11	24	89	162142	He did not know . 
7203	br-k11	24	90	162147	His mind closed on that prospect , as though fog had descended to blot_out a valley . 
7204	br-k11	25	91	162164	Far_off , in the dusk , he heard voices singing , muffled but strong . 
7205	br-k11	25	92	162179	In one of the huts a group of men were huddled_together , singing . 
7206	br-k11	25	93	162193	He stopped . 
7207	br-k11	25	94	162196	He strained to hear . 
7208	br-k11	25	95	162201	He heard the words : `` Rock_of_Ages , cleft for me , Let me hide myself in Thee ! 
7209	br-k11	25	96	162220	Let the water and the blood From Thy riven side '' . 
7210	br-k11	26	97	162232	He thought : I am a Jew from Bavaria . 
7211	br-k11	27	98	162242	He was standing there , he thought , in Virginia , in the thickening dusk , in a costly greatcoat that had belonged_to another Jew . 
7212	br-k11	27	99	162268	That other Jew , a young_man too , had left that greatcoat behind , in a rich house , and marched away . 
7213	br-k11	27	100	162291	He had crossed the river which now , beyond the woods yonder , was sliding darkly under the mist . 
7214	br-k11	27	101	162311	He had plunged into the dark woods beyond . 
7215	br-k11	27	102	162320	He had died there . 
7216	br-k11	28	103	162325	What had that man , that other young Jew , felt as he stood in the twilight and heard other men , far_away , singing together ? 
7217	br-k11	28	104	162352	. 
7218	br-k11	29	105	162353	Adam thought_of the hutments , regiment after regiment , row after row , the thousands of huts , stretching away into the night . 
7219	br-k11	29	106	162377	He thought_of the men , the nameless thousands , huddling in them . 
7220	br-k11	29	107	162390	He thought_of Simms_Purdew snoring on his bunk while Pullen_James crouched by the hearth , skirmishing an undershirt for lice , and a wet log sizzled . 
7221	br-k11	29	108	162416	He thought_of Simms_Purdew , who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield , a maniacal scream on his lips , and swung a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of Rebel bayonets about him . 
7222	br-k11	30	109	162457	He thought_of Simms_Purdew rising_up , fearless in glory . 
7223	br-k11	30	110	162466	He felt the sweetness of pity flood through him , veining his very flesh . 
7224	br-k11	30	111	162481	Those men , lying in the huts , they did not know . 
7225	br-k11	30	112	162494	They did not know who they were or know their own worth . 
7226	br-k11	30	113	162507	In the pity for them his loneliness was gone . 
7227	br-k11	31	114	162517	Then he thought_of Aaron_Blaustein standing in his rich house saying : `` God is tired_of taking the blame . 
7228	br-k11	31	115	162536	He is going_to let History take the blame for_a_while '' . 
7229	br-k11	32	116	162547	He thought_of the old_man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier . 
7230	br-k11	33	117	162560	He thought : Only in my heart can I make the world hang_together . 
7231	br-k11	34	118	162574	Adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the hut . 
7232	br-k11	34	119	162585	He saw Mose squatting by the hearth , breaking_up hardtack into a pan . 
7233	br-k11	34	120	162599	A pot was boiling on the coals . 
7234	br-k11	34	121	162607	`` Done give Ole_Buckra all his money '' ? 
7235	br-k11	34	122	162616	Mose asked softly . 
7236	br-k11	35	123	162620	Adam nodded . 
7237	br-k11	36	124	162623	`` Yeah '' , Mose murmured , `` yeah . 
7238	br-k11	36	125	162633	And look what he done give us '' . 
7239	br-k11	37	126	162642	Adam looked at the pot . 
7240	br-k11	37	127	162648	`` What is it '' ? he asked . 
7241	br-k11	38	128	162657	`` Chicken '' , Mose said , and theatrically licked his lips . 
7242	br-k11	38	129	162670	`` Gre't big fat chicken , yeah '' . 
7243	br-k11	38	130	162679	He licked his lips again . 
7244	br-k11	39	131	162685	Then : `` Yeah . 
7245	br-k11	39	132	162690	A chicken with six tits and a tail lak a corkscrew . 
7246	br-k11	39	133	162702	And hit squealed for slop '' . 
7247	br-k11	39	134	162709	Mose giggled . 
7248	br-k11	39	135	162712	`` Fooled you , huh ? 
7249	br-k11	39	136	162718	It is the same ole same , tell me hit 's name . 
7250	br-k11	39	137	162731	It is sowbelly with tits on . 
7251	br-k11	39	138	162738	It is salt_po'k . 
7252	br-k11	39	139	162742	It is salt_po'k and skippers . 
7253	br-k11	39	140	162748	That po'k , it was so full of skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say , ' Hoo-pig ' . 
7254	br-k11	39	141	162773	Had_to put my foot on_it to hole it down while I cut it up fer the lob-scuse '' . 
7255	br-k11	40	142	162792	He dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into the boiling pot of lobscouse . 
7256	br-k11	40	143	162806	`` Good_ole lob-scuse '' , he mumbled , and stirred the pot . 
7257	br-k11	40	144	162819	He stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder . 
7258	br-k11	40	145	162828	`` Know what Ole_Buckra et tonight '' ? he demanded . 
7259	br-k11	40	146	162839	`` Know what I had_to fix fer Ole Him '' ? 
7260	br-k11	41	147	162850	Adam shook his head . 
7261	br-k11	42	148	162855	`` Chicken '' , Mose said . 
7262	br-k12	1	1	162862	She was a child too much a part of her environment , too eager to grow and learn and experience . 
7263	br-k12	1	2	162883	Once , they were at Easthampton for the summer ( again , Fritzie said , a good place , even though they were being robbed ) . 
7264	br-k12	1	3	162910	One soft evening - that marvelous sea blessed time when the sun 's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts everything - Amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk . 
7265	br-k12	1	4	162948	Fritzie was on the couch reading ; Laura was sitting in an easy_chair about eight feet away . 
7266	br-k12	1	5	162966	The infant , in white terry-cloth bathrobe , her face intense and purposeful , had essayed a_few wobbly steps toward her father . 
7267	br-k12	1	6	162989	`` Y'all wanna walk - walk '' , he said . 
7268	br-k12	1	7	163000	Then , gently , he shoved her behind toward Laura . 
7269	br-k12	1	8	163011	Amy walked - making_it halfway across the cottage floor . 
7270	br-k12	1	9	163021	She lost not a second , picking herself up and continuing her pilgrimage to Laura . 
7271	br-k12	1	10	163037	Then Laura took her gently and shoved her off again , toward Fritzie : 
7272	br-k12	1	11	163051	Amy did not laugh - this was work , concentration , achievement . 
7273	br-k12	1	12	163064	In a_few minutes she was making the ten foot hike unaided ; soon she was parading around the house , flaunting her new skill . 
7274	br-k12	2	13	163089	Some liar 's logic , a wisp of optimism as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came_through the window ( a euphoria perhaps engendered by the pill Fritzie had given her ) , consoled her for a moment . 
7275	br-k12	2	14	163130	Amy had_to be safe , had_to come_back to them - if only to reap that share of life 's experiences that were her due , if only to give her parents another chance to do better by her . 
7276	br-k12	2	15	163169	Through the swathings of terror , she jabbed deceit 's sharp point - Amy would be reborn , a new child , with new parents , living under new circumstances . 
7277	br-k12	2	16	163200	The comfort was short-lived , yet she found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion . 
7278	br-k12	2	17	163230	Gazing at her husband 's drugged body , his chest rising and falling in mindless rhythms , she saw the grandeur of his fictional world , that lush garden from which he plucked flowers and herbs . 
7279	br-k12	2	18	163267	She envied him . 
7280	br-k12	2	19	163271	She admired him . 
7281	br-k12	3	20	163275	In the darkness , she saw him stirring . 
7282	br-k12	3	21	163284	He seemed to be muttering , his voice surprisingly clear . 
7283	br-k12	3	22	163295	`` Y'all should have let me take that money out '' , Andrus said . 
7284	br-k12	3	23	163310	`` ' Nother minute I 'd have been fine . 
7285	br-k12	3	24	163320	Y'all should have let me do it '' . 
7286	br-k12	4	25	163329	Laura touched his hand . 
7287	br-k12	4	26	163334	`` Yes , I know , Fritzie . 
7288	br-k12	4	27	163342	I should have '' . 
7289	br-k12	5	28	163347	The heat intensified on Tuesday . 
7290	br-k12	5	29	163353	Southern_California gasped and blinked under an autumn hot_spell , drier , more enervating , more laden with man 's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer past . 
7291	br-k12	5	30	163383	It could continue this way , hitting 106 and more in the Valley , Joe_McFeeley knew , into October . 
7292	br-k12	5	31	163403	He and Irvin_Moll were sipping coffee at the breakfast bar . 
7293	br-k12	5	32	163414	Both had been up since 7 : 00 - Irv on the early morning watch , McFeeley unable to sleep during his four hour relief . 
7294	br-k12	5	33	163440	The night before , they had telephoned the Andrus_maid , Selena_Masters , and she had arrived early , bursting her vigorous presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused McFeeley and confounded Moll . 
7295	br-k12	5	34	163476	The latter , thanking her for the coffee , had winked and muttered , `` Sure_'_nuff , honey '' . 
7296	br-k12	5	35	163496	Selena was the wrong woman for these crudities . 
7297	br-k12	5	36	163505	With a hard eye , she informed Moll : `` Do n't sure_'_nuff me , officer . 
7298	br-k12	5	37	163522	I'm honey only to my husband , understand '' ? 
7299	br-k12	5	38	163532	Sergeant_Moll understood . 
7300	br-k12	5	39	163535	The maid was very black and very energetic , trim in a yellow pique uniform . 
7301	br-k12	5	40	163551	Her speech was barren_of southernisms ; she was one of Eliot_Sparling 's neutralized minorities , adopting the rolling R 's and constricted vowels of Los_Angeles . 
7302	br-k12	5	41	163577	Not seeing her dark intelligent face , one would have gauged the voice as that of a Westwood_Village matron , ten years out of Iowa . 
7303	br-k12	5	42	163603	After she had served the detectives coffee and toast ( they politely declined eggs , uncomfortable about their tenancy ) , she settled_down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock_market quotations . 
7304	br-k12	5	43	163637	While she was thus engaged , McFeeley questioned her about her whereabouts the previous day , any recollections she had of people hanging_around , of overcurious delivery_boys or repairmen , of strange cars cruising the neighborhood . 
7305	br-k12	5	44	163674	She answered him precisely , missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports . 
7306	br-k12	5	45	163691	Selena_Masters , Joe realized , was her own woman . 
7307	br-k12	5	46	163701	She was the only kind of Negro Laura_Andrus would want around : independent , unservile , probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework - and doubly efficient . 
7308	br-k12	6	47	163731	When the parents emerged from the bedroom a_few minutes later , the maid greeted them quietly . 
7309	br-k12	6	48	163748	`` I'm awful sorry about what 's happened '' , Selena said . 
7310	br-k12	6	49	163761	`` Maybe today 'll be a good news day '' . 
7311	br-k12	6	50	163772	She charged off to the bedrooms . 
7312	br-k12	7	51	163779	Moll took his coffee into the nursery . 
7313	br-k12	7	52	163787	During the night , a phone_company technician had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones . 
7314	br-k12	7	53	163806	Someone would have_to remain in the office continually . 
7315	br-k12	7	54	163815	McFeeley greeted the parents , then studied his notebook . 
7316	br-k12	7	55	163825	He wanted to take the mother to headquarters at_once and start her on the mug_file . 
7317	br-k12	8	56	163841	`` Sleep well '' ? he asked . 
7318	br-k12	9	57	163849	Andrus did not answer him . 
7319	br-k12	9	58	163855	His face was bloated with drugging , redder than normal . 
7320	br-k12	9	59	163866	The woman had the glassy look of an invalid , as if she had not slept at_all . 
7321	br-k12	9	60	163884	`` Oh - we managed '' , she said . 
7322	br-k12	9	61	163894	`` I'm a_little groggy . 
7323	br-k12	9	62	163899	Did anything happen during the night '' ? 
7324	br-k12	10	63	163907	`` Few crank_calls '' , McFeeley said . 
7325	br-k12	10	64	163915	`` A_couple_of tips we 're running_down - nothing promising . 
7326	br-k12	10	65	163925	We can expect more of the same . 
7327	br-k12	10	66	163933	Too bad your number is in the directory '' . 
7328	br-k12	11	67	163943	`` Did n't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when I had it listed '' , Andrus muttered . 
7329	br-k12	11	68	163964	He settled_on the sofa with his coffee , warming his hands on the cup , although the room was heavy with heat . 
7330	br-k12	12	69	163987	The three had little to say to each other . 
7331	br-k12	12	70	163997	The previous night 's horror - the absolute failure , overcast with the intrusions of the press , had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness , of play-acting . 
7332	br-k12	12	71	164029	Sipping their coffee , discussing the weather , the day 's shopping , Fritzie 's commitments at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoided the radio , the morning TV news_show , even the front page of the Santa_Luisa_Register , resting on the kitchen bar . 
7333	br-k12	12	72	164081	Kidnapper Spurns Ransom ; Amy Still Missing . 
7334	br-k12	12	73	164089	Once , Andrus walked by it , hastily scanned the bold black headline and the five column lead of the article ( by Duane_Bosch , staff correspondent - age not given ) , and muttered : `` We a buncha national celebrities '' . 
7335	br-k12	13	74	164133	McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to police_headquarters in a half hour . 
7336	br-k12	13	75	164148	Before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbors . 
7337	br-k12	13	76	164159	He did not want_to bring the Andruses to the station_house too early - Rheinholdt had summoned a press_conference , and he did n't want them subjected to the reporters again . 
7338	br-k12	13	77	164190	He could think_of nothing else to tell them : no assurances , no hopeful hints at great discoveries that day . 
7339	br-k12	13	78	164211	When the detective left , Andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project . 
7340	br-k12	13	79	164239	Mrs._Andrus was talking to the maid , arranging for her to come in every_day , instead of the four days she now worked . 
7341	br-k12	14	80	164263	Outside , only a handful of reporters remained . 
7342	br-k12	14	81	164272	The bulk of the press_corps was covering Rheinholdt 's conference . 
7343	br-k12	14	82	164283	In_contrast to the caravan of the previous night , there were only four cars parked across the street . 
7344	br-k12	14	83	164302	Two men he did not recognize were sipping coffee and munching sweet_rolls . 
7345	br-k12	14	84	164315	He did not see Sparling , or DeGroot , or Ringel , or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed him twelve hours ago . 
7346	br-k12	14	85	164342	However , the litter remained , augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers . 
7347	br-k12	14	86	164355	The street_cleaner had not_yet been around . 
7348	br-k12	15	87	164362	One of the reporters called to him : `` Anything new , Lieutenant '' ? 
7349	br-k12	15	88	164377	And he ignored him , skirting the parked cars and walking up the path to the Skopas house . 
7350	br-k12	15	89	164396	When McFeeley was halfway to the door , the proprietor emerged - a mountainous , dark man , his head thick_with resiny black hair , his eyes like two of the black_olives he imported in boatloads . 
7351	br-k12	15	90	164433	McFeeley identified himself . 
7352	br-k12	15	91	164437	The master of the house , his nourished face unrevealing , consented to postpone his departure a_few minutes to talk to the detective . 
7353	br-k12	16	92	164461	Inside , as_soon_as Mr._Skopas had disclosed - in a hoarse whisper - the detective 's errand , his family gathered in a huddle , forming a mass of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of a baroque fireplace . 
7354	br-k12	16	93	164507	Flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps , they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait . 
7355	br-k12	17	94	164525	It was amazing how they had herded together for protection : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rising from the breakfast_table ; a gross boy in his teens , shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descending the marble staircase ; then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor . 
7356	br-k12	18	95	164596	They answered him in monosyllables , nods , occasionally muttering in Greek to one another , awaiting the word from Papa , who restlessly cracked his knuckles , anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway . 
7357	br-k12	18	96	164639	No , they had n't seen anyone around ; no , they did n't know the Andrus family ; yes , they had read about the case ; yes , they had let some reporters use their phone , but they would no_longer . 
7358	br-k12	18	97	164683	They offered no opinions , volunteered nothing , betrayed no emotions . 
7359	br-k12	18	98	164695	Studying them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple . 
7360	br-k12	18	99	164709	The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human_beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy . 
7361	br-k12	18	100	164727	He imagined they were the kind whose tax_returns were never examined ( if they were , they were never penalized ) , whose children had no unhappy romances , whose names never knew scandal . 
7362	br-k12	18	101	164762	The equation was simple : wealth brought them happiness , and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had , let no_one in on the secrets . 
7363	br-k12	18	102	164798	By comparison , Fritzie and Laura_Andrus were quivering fledglings . 
7364	br-k12	18	103	164808	They possessed no outer fortifications , no hard shells of confidence ; they had enough difficulty getting from day to day , let_alone having an awful crime thrust upon them . 
7365	br-k12	18	104	164839	Skopas expressed no curiosity over the case , offered no expression of sympathy , made no move to escort McFeeley to the door . 
7366	br-k12	18	105	164863	All four remained impacted on the sofa until he had left . 
7367	br-k12	19	106	164875	He had spoken_to Mrs._Emerson the previous day . 
7368	br-k12	19	107	164883	There remained a family named Kahler , owners of a two story Tudor style house on the south_side of the Andrus home . 
7369	br-k12	19	108	164906	Their names had not come_up in any discussions with Laura , and he had no idea what they would be like . 
7370	br-k12	19	109	164928	McFeeley noted the immaculate lawn and gardens : each blade of grass cropped , bright and firm ; each shrub glazed with good_health . 
7371	br-k12	20	110	164952	The door was answered by a slender man in his sixties - straight_backed , somewhat clerical in manner , wearing rimless glasses . 
7372	br-k12	20	111	164975	When Joe identified himself , he nodded , unsmiling , and ushered him into a sedate living_room . 
7373	br-k12	20	112	164993	Mrs._Kahler joined them . 
7374	br-k12	20	113	164997	She had a dried-out quality - a gray , lean woman , not unattractive . 
7375	br-k12	20	114	165012	Both were dressed rather formally . 
7376	br-k12	20	115	165018	The man wore a vest and a tie , the woman had_on a dark green dress and three strands of pearls . 
7377	br-k12	21	116	165040	`` Funny thing '' , Mr._Kahler said , when they were seated , `` when I heard you ringing , I figured it was that guy down the block , Hausman '' . 
7378	br-k12	21	117	165073	McFeeley looked puzzled . 
7379	br-k12	21	118	165077	Kahler continued : `` I fixed his dog the other day and I guess he 's sore , so I expected him to come barging_in '' . 
7380	br-k12	21	119	165104	Mr._Kahler went_on to explain how Hausman 's fox_terrier had been `` making '' in his flower_beds . 
7381	br-k12	21	120	165121	The dog refused to be scared_off , so Kahler had purchased some small firecrackers . 
7382	br-k12	21	121	165136	He would lay in wait in the garage , and when the terrier came scratching around , he 'd let_fly with a cherry_bomb . 
7383	br-k12	21	122	165160	`` Scared the hell out of him '' , Kahler grinned . 
7384	br-k12	21	123	165172	`` I hit him in the ass once '' . 
7385	br-k12	21	124	165182	Both grinned at the detective . 
7386	br-k12	21	125	165188	`` Finally , all I needed was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked_like a firecracker and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life '' . 
7387	br-k13	1	1	165219	In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room , and then they went across the hall to the kitchen . 
7388	br-k13	1	2	165243	She was intimidated by the stove . 
7389	br-k13	1	3	165250	He found the pilot_light and turned_on one of the burners for her . 
7390	br-k13	1	4	165263	The gas flamed_up two inches high . 
7391	br-k13	1	5	165270	They found the teakettle and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox . 
7392	br-k13	1	6	165287	Several sections of a loaf of dark_bread ; butter ; jam ; a tiny cake of ice . 
7393	br-k13	1	7	165305	In their search for what turned_out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver , they opened every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry . 
7394	br-k13	1	8	165334	While she was settling the teacart , he went_back across the hall to their bedroom , opened one of the suitcases , and took_out powdered coffee and sugar . 
7395	br-k13	1	9	165363	She appeared with the teacart and he opened the windows . 
7396	br-k13	2	10	165374	`` Do you want to call Eugene '' ? 
7397	br-k13	3	11	165383	He did n't , but it was not really a question , and so he left the room , walked down the hall to the front of the apartment , hesitated , and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study . 
7398	br-k13	3	12	165427	A sleepy voice answered . 
7399	br-k13	4	13	165432	`` Le petit_dejeuner '' , Harold said , in an accent that did credit to Miss_Sloan , his high-school French_teacher . 
7400	br-k13	4	14	165453	At_the_same_time , his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here , and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable , peace-loving , and dependable in everybody . 
7401	br-k13	5	15	165480	Since ordinary breakfast-table conversation was impossible , it was at_least something that they were able to offer Eugene the sugar_bowl with their sugar in it , and the plate of bread_and_butter , and that Eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first . 
7402	br-k13	5	16	165527	Eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water . 
7403	br-k13	5	17	165545	Stirring , he said : `` I am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with you today '' . 
7404	br-k13	6	18	165567	They assured him that they did not expect or need to be entertained . 
7405	br-k13	7	19	165581	Harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee in his cup and filled it with hot water , and then , stirring , he sat_back in his chair . 
7406	br-k13	7	20	165609	The chair creaked . 
7407	br-k13	7	21	165613	Every time he moved or said something , the chair creaked again . 
7408	br-k13	8	22	165626	Eugene was not entirely silent , or openly rude - unless asking Harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act of rudeness . 
7409	br-k13	8	23	165660	It went right on creaking under his own considerable weight , and all it needed , Harold thought , was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of_it . 
7410	br-k13	9	24	165699	Through the open window they heard sounds below in the street : cartwheels , a tired horse 's plodding step , voices . 
7411	br-k13	9	25	165722	Harold indicated the photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in . 
7412	br-k13	9	26	165739	Eugene told him and he promptly forgot . 
7413	br-k13	9	27	165747	They passed the marmalade , the bread , the black-market butter , back_and_forth . 
7414	br-k13	9	28	165761	Nothing was said about hotels or train journeys . 
7415	br-k13	10	29	165770	Eugene offered Harold his car , to use at any time he cared to , and when this offer was not accepted , the armchair creaked . 
7416	br-k13	10	30	165797	They all three had another cup of coffee . 
7417	br-k13	10	31	165806	Eugene was in his pajamas and dressing_gown , and on his large feet he wore yellow Turkish slippers that turned_up at the toes . 
7418	br-k13	11	32	165830	`` Ex-cuse me '' , he said in Berlitz_English , and got_up and left them , to bathe and dress . 
7419	br-k13	12	33	165851	The first shrill ring of the telephone brought Harold out into the hall . 
7420	br-k13	12	34	165865	He realized that he had no idea where the telephone was . 
7421	br-k13	12	35	165877	At that moment the bathroom door flew_open and Eugene came_out , with his face lathered for shaving , and strode down the hall , tying the sash of his dressing_gown as he went . 
7422	br-k13	12	36	165911	The telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall . 
7423	br-k13	12	37	165925	Between the telephone and the wall_plug there was sixty feet of cord , and when the conversation came to an end , Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub . 
7424	br-k13	12	38	165979	Before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could do for them . 
7425	br-k13	12	39	166001	Harold shook his head . 
7426	br-k13	13	40	166006	`` Sabine called a_few minutes ago '' , Eugene said . 
7427	br-k13	13	41	166017	`` She wants you and Barbara to have dinner with her tomorrow night '' . 
7428	br-k13	14	42	166032	He handed Harold a key to the front_door , and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment . 
7429	br-k13	15	43	166056	When enough time had elapsed so_that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten , Harold went_out into the hall and stood looking into one room after another . 
7430	br-k13	15	44	166089	In the room next to theirs was a huge cradle , of mahogany , ornately carved and decorated with gold_leaf . 
7431	br-k13	15	45	166110	It was the most important-looking cradle he had ever seen . 
7432	br-k13	15	46	166121	Then came their bathroom , and then a bedroom that , judging by the photographs on the walls , must belong_to Mme_Cestre . 
7433	br-k13	15	47	166144	A young_woman who looked_like Alix , with her two children . 
7434	br-k13	15	48	166155	Alix and Eugene on their wedding_day . 
7435	br-k13	15	49	166162	Matching photographs in oval frames of Mme_Bonenfant and an elderly man who must be Alix 's grandfather . 
7436	br-k13	15	50	166180	Mme_Vienot , considerably younger and very different . 
7437	br-k13	15	51	166188	The schoolboy . 
7438	br-k13	15	52	166191	And a gray-haired man whose glance - direct , lifelike , and mildly accusing - was contradicted by the gilt and black frame . 
7439	br-k13	15	53	166215	It was the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead_person . 
7440	br-k13	15	54	166232	Professor_Cestre , could it be ? 
7441	br-k13	16	55	166238	With the metal shutters closed , the dining_room was so dark that it seemed still night in there . 
7442	br-k13	16	56	166257	One of the drawing-room shutters was partly open and he made_out the shapes of chairs and sofas , which seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet . 
7443	br-k13	16	57	166286	The curtains were of the same material , and there were some big oil_paintings - portraits in the style of Lancret and Boucher . 
7444	br-k13	17	58	166310	Though , taken individually , the big rooms were , or seemed to be , square , the apartment as a whole formed a triangle . 
7445	br-k13	17	59	166336	The apex , the study where Eugene slept , was light and bright and airy and cheerful . 
7446	br-k13	17	60	166354	The window looked_out_on the Place_Redoute - it was the only window of the apartment that did . 
7447	br-k13	17	61	166371	Looking_around slowly , he saw a marble fireplace , a desk , a low bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass panes in the doors . 
7448	br-k13	17	62	166400	The daybed Eugene had slept in , made_up now with its dark-brown velours cover and pillows . 
7449	br-k13	17	63	166417	The portable record_player with a pile of classical records beside it . 
7450	br-k13	17	64	166429	Beethoven 's Fifth was the one on top . 
7451	br-k13	17	65	166438	Da-da-da-dum . 
7452	br-k13	17	66	166440	Music could not be Eugene 's passion . 
7453	br-k13	17	67	166448	Besides , the records were dusty . 
7454	br-k13	17	68	166455	He tried the doors of the bookcase . 
7455	br-k13	17	69	166463	Locked . 
7456	br-k13	17	70	166465	The titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed wires : works on theology , astral physics , history , biology , political_science . 
7457	br-k13	17	71	166489	No poetry . 
7458	br-k13	17	72	166492	No novels . 
7459	br-k13	17	73	166495	He moved_over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on_it but not touching anything . 
7460	br-k13	17	74	166512	The clock on the mantel_piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room . 
7461	br-k13	18	75	166538	The concierge called_out to them as they were passing_through the foyer . 
7462	br-k13	18	76	166550	Her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building , and her small front_room was clogged with heavy furniture - a big , round , oak dining_table and chairs , a buffet , with a row of unclaimed letters inserted between the mirror and its frame . 
7463	br-k13	18	77	166600	The suitcases had come while they were out , and had been put in their room , the concierge said . 
7464	br-k13	19	78	166621	He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said : `` Now what do we do '' ? 
7465	br-k13	20	79	166641	`` Call the Vouillemont , I guess '' . 
7466	br-k13	21	80	166650	`` I guess '' . 
7467	br-k13	22	81	166655	Rather_than sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered , they had gone sight-seeing . 
7468	br-k13	22	82	166671	They went to the Flea_Market , expecting to find the treasures of Europe , and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in Tours . 
7469	br-k13	22	83	166700	Cheap clothing and junk of every sort , as far as the eye could see . 
7470	br-k13	22	84	166716	They looked , even_so . 
7471	br-k13	22	85	166721	Looked at everything . 
7472	br-k13	22	86	166725	Barbara bought some cotton aprons , and Harold bought shoestrings . 
7473	br-k13	22	87	166736	They had lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad , busy , unpicturesque streets , and coming home they got lost in the Metro ; it took them over an hour to get_back to the station where they should have changed , in_order to take the line that went to the Place_Redoute . 
7474	br-k13	22	88	166793	It was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole . 
7475	br-k13	22	89	166817	When he opened the door , there stood Eugene , on his way out_of the apartment . 
7476	br-k13	22	90	166834	He was wearing sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt , and in his hand he carried a little black bag . 
7477	br-k13	22	91	166856	He did not explain where he was going , and they did not ask . 
7478	br-k13	22	92	166871	Instead , they went_on down the hall to their room . 
7479	br-k13	23	93	166882	`` Do you think he could be having an affair '' ? 
7480	br-k13	23	94	166894	Barbara asked , as they heard the front_door close . 
7481	br-k13	24	95	166904	`` Oh_no '' , Harold said , shocked . 
7482	br-k13	25	96	166913	`` Well , this is France , after_all '' . 
7483	br-k13	26	97	166923	`` I know , but there must be some other explanation . 
7484	br-k13	26	98	166935	He 's probably spending the evening with friends '' . 
7485	br-k13	27	99	166945	`` And for that he needs a little bag '' ? 
7486	br-k13	28	100	166956	They went shopping in the neighborhood , and bought two loaves_of_bread with the ration coupons they had been given in Blois , and some cheese , and a dozen eggs , and a bag of oranges from a peddler in the Place_Redoute - the first oranges they had seen since they landed . 
7487	br-k13	28	101	167009	They had Vermouth , sitting in_front_of a cafe . 
7488	br-k13	28	102	167018	When they got home Harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment , and thought how , under different circumstances , they might have stayed_on here , in these old-fashioned , high-ceilinged rooms that reminded him of the Irelands ' apartment in the East_Eighties . 
7489	br-k13	28	103	167064	They could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days . 
7490	br-k13	29	104	167076	He went down the hall to Eugene 's bathroom , to turn_on the hot-water_heater , and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming_trunks . 
7491	br-k13	29	105	167107	He felt them . 
7492	br-k13	29	106	167111	They were damp . 
7493	br-k13	29	107	167115	He reached_out and felt the bath_towel hanging_on the towel_rack over the tub . 
7494	br-k13	29	108	167128	Damp also . 
7495	br-k13	29	109	167131	He looked_around the room and then called_out : 
7496	br-k13	29	110	167139	`` Come here , quick '' ? 
7497	br-k13	30	111	167146	`` What is it '' ? 
7498	br-k13	30	112	167152	Barbara asked , standing in the doorway . 
7499	br-k13	30	113	167160	`` I 've solved the mystery of the little bag . 
7500	br-k13	30	114	167171	There it is * * h and there is what was in it . 
7501	br-k13	30	115	167185	But where do people go swimming in Paris ? 
7502	br-k13	30	116	167194	That boat in the river , maybe '' . 
7503	br-k13	31	117	167203	`` What boat '' ? 
7504	br-k13	32	118	167208	`` There 's a big boat anchored near the Place_de_la_Concorde , with a swimming_pool in it - did n't you notice it ? 
7505	br-k13	32	119	167231	But if he has time to go swimming , he had time to be with us '' . 
7506	br-k13	33	120	167249	She looked at him in surprise . 
7507	br-k13	34	121	167256	`` I know '' , he said , reading her mind . 
7508	br-k13	35	122	167268	`` I do n't know what I'm going_to do with you '' . 
7509	br-k13	36	123	167281	`` It 's because we are in France '' , he said , `` and know so few people . 
7510	br-k13	36	124	167301	So something like this matters more_than it would at home . 
7511	br-k13	36	125	167312	Also , he was so nice when he was nice '' . 
7512	br-k13	37	126	167324	`` All because I did n't feel_like dancing '' . 
7513	br-k13	38	127	167334	`` I do n't think it was that , really '' . 
7514	br-k13	39	128	167346	`` Then what was it '' ? 
7515	br-k13	40	129	167353	`` I do n't know . 
7516	br-k13	40	130	167359	I wish I did . 
7517	br-k13	40	131	167364	The tweed coat , maybe . 
7518	br-k13	40	132	167370	The thing about Eugene is that he 's very proud '' . 
7519	br-k13	41	133	167382	And the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing_suit pointed_out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be . 
7520	br-k13	41	134	167413	For_instance - what about all those people Harold_Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly , as if this were the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of knowing each other ? 
7521	br-k13	42	135	167446	Fortunately , the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered , or we would all have_to go sleep in the open fields . 
7522	br-k13	42	136	167473	And in_any_case , answers may clarify but they do not change anything . 
7523	br-k14	1	1	167486	He brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes , of about a_hundred pounds ' weight . 
7524	br-k14	1	2	167504	They took Jesus 's body , then , and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices ; that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial . 
7525	br-k14	2	3	167532	Listed as present at the Descent were Mary , Mary 's sister , Mary_Magdalene , John , Joseph_of_Arimathea , Nicodemus . 
7526	br-k14	2	4	167553	Search as he might , he could find no place where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus . 
7527	br-k14	2	5	167579	Mostly the scene was crowded with mourners , such_as the dramatic Dell'Arca_Lamentation in Bologna , where the grief-stricken spectators had usurped Mary 's last poignant moment . 
7528	br-k14	3	6	167606	In his concept there could be no_one else present . 
7529	br-k14	4	7	167616	His first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe . 
7530	br-k14	4	8	167631	When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap ? 
7531	br-k14	4	9	167646	Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph_of_Arimathea was at Pontius_Pilate 's asking for Christ 's body , Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had gone_home to mourn . 
7532	br-k14	4	10	167687	Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses . 
7533	br-k14	4	11	167702	They would feel what Mary was undergoing . 
7534	br-k14	4	12	167710	There would be no halos , no angels . 
7535	br-k14	4	13	167719	These would be two human_beings , whom God had chosen . 
7536	br-k14	5	14	167730	He felt close to Mary , having spent so long concentrating_on the beginning of her journey . 
7537	br-k14	5	15	167747	Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; her son was dead . 
7538	br-k14	5	16	167760	Even_though he would later be resurrected , he was at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone_through on the cross . 
7539	br-k14	5	17	167789	In his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt for his mother ; only what Mary felt for her son . 
7540	br-k14	5	18	167819	Jesus ' inert body would be passive , his eyes closed . 
7541	br-k14	5	19	167831	Mary would have_to carry the human communication . 
7542	br-k14	5	20	167839	This seemed right to him . 
7543	br-k14	6	21	167845	It was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems . 
7544	br-k14	6	22	167858	Since his Christ was to be life_size , how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming ungainly ? 
7545	br-k14	6	23	167881	His Mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child . 
7546	br-k14	7	24	167910	There was only one way to accomplish this : by design , by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept . 
7547	br-k14	8	25	167945	He started by making free sketches to loosen_up his thinking so_that images would appear on paper . 
7548	br-k14	8	26	167962	Visually , these approximated what he was feeling within himself . 
7549	br-k14	8	27	167973	At_the_same_time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping_at the stalls , storing up fresh impressions of what they looked_like , how they moved . 
7550	br-k14	8	28	168003	In_particular he sought the gentle , sweet-faced nuns , with head_coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper . 
7551	br-k14	9	29	168038	Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of folds . 
7552	br-k14	9	30	168059	He improvised as he went_along , completing a life-size clay figure , then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud . 
7553	br-k14	9	31	168112	No fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna 's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil . 
7554	br-k14	9	32	168155	When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made . 
7555	br-k14	10	33	168171	`` So that 's sculpture '' , commented Argiento wryly , when he had sluiced down the floor for a week , `` making mud pies '' . 
7556	br-k14	11	34	168199	Michelangelo grinned . 
7557	br-k14	11	35	168202	`` See , Argiento , if you control the way these folds are bunched , like this , or made to flow , you can enrich the body attitudes . 
7558	br-k14	11	36	168232	They can have as much tactile appeal as flesh_and_bone '' . 
7559	br-k14	12	37	168243	He went_into the Jewish_quarter , wanting to draw Hebraic faces so_that he could reach a visual understanding of how Christ might have looked . 
7560	br-k14	12	38	168267	The Jewish section was in Trastevere , near the Tiber at the church of San_Francesco_a_Ripa . 
7561	br-k14	12	39	168283	The colony had been small until the Spanish_Inquisition_of_1492 drove many Jews into Rome . 
7562	br-k14	12	40	168297	Here , for_the_most_part , they were well treated , as a `` reminder of the Old_Testament heritage of Christianity '' ; many_of their gifted members were prominent in the Vatican as physicians , musicians , bankers . 
7563	br-k14	13	41	168334	The men did not object to his sketching them while they went_about their work , but no_one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose . 
7564	br-k14	13	42	168362	He was told to ask for Rabbi_Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon . 
7565	br-k14	13	43	168376	Michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of study , a gentle old_man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes , robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head . 
7566	br-k14	13	44	168409	He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his congregation . 
7567	br-k14	13	45	168424	When Michelangelo explained why he had come , Rabbi_Melzi replied gravely : 
7568	br-k14	14	46	168436	`` The Bible forbids us to bow_down to or to make graven_images . 
7569	br-k14	14	47	168449	That is why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture '' . 
7570	br-k14	15	48	168468	`` But , Rabbi_Melzi , you do n't object to others creating works_of_art '' ? 
7571	br-k14	16	49	168483	`` Not at all . 
7572	br-k14	16	50	168488	Each religion has its own tenets '' . 
7573	br-k14	17	51	168496	`` I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble . 
7574	br-k14	17	52	168507	I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew . 
7575	br-k14	17	53	168516	I cannot accomplish this if you will not help me '' . 
7576	br-k14	18	54	168528	The rabbi said thoughtfully , `` I would not want my people to get_in trouble with the Church '' . 
7577	br-k14	19	55	168548	`` I am working for the Cardinal of San_Dionigi . 
7578	br-k14	19	56	168558	I'm sure he would approve '' . 
7579	br-k14	20	57	168565	`` What kind of models would you prefer '' ? 
7580	br-k14	21	58	168575	`` Workmen . 
7581	br-k14	21	59	168578	In their mid_thirties . 
7582	br-k14	21	60	168582	Not bulky laborers , but sinewy men . 
7583	br-k14	21	61	168590	With intelligence . 
7584	br-k14	21	62	168593	And sensitivity '' . 
7585	br-k14	22	63	168597	Rabbi_Melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes . 
7586	br-k14	23	64	168608	`` Leave me your address . 
7587	br-k14	23	65	168614	I will send you the best the quarter has to offer '' . 
7588	br-k14	23	66	168627	Michelangelo hurried to Sangallo 's solitary bachelor room with his sketches , asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated Madonna . 
7589	br-k14	23	67	168653	Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch . 
7590	br-k14	23	68	168663	Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber . 
7591	br-k14	23	69	168669	Together he and Argiento built the stand , covering it with blankets . 
7592	br-k14	24	70	168682	His first model arrived at dusk . 
7593	br-k14	24	71	168689	He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe , so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , led him to the kitchen to take_off his clothes . 
7594	br-k14	24	72	168725	He then draped him over the rough stand , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother 's lap . 
7595	br-k14	24	73	168754	The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; only the instructions from his rabbi kept him from bolting . 
7596	br-k14	24	74	168773	But at the end of the sitting , when Michelangelo showed him the quick , free drawings , with the mother roughed in , holding her son , the model grasped what Michelangelo was_after , and promised to speak_to his friends . 
7597	br-k14	24	75	168815	He worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi . 
7598	br-k14	25	76	168830	Mary presented quite a different problem . 
7599	br-k14	25	77	168837	Though this sculpture must take_place thirty-three years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive_of her as a woman in her mid-fifties , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry . 
7600	br-k14	25	78	168876	His image of the_Virgin had always been that of a young_woman , even as had his memory of his mother . 
7601	br-k14	26	79	168897	Jacopo_Galli introduced him into several Roman homes . 
7602	br-k14	26	80	168905	Here he sketched , sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk , young_girls not_yet twenty , some about to be married , some married a year or two . 
7603	br-k14	26	81	168936	Since the Santo_Spirito_hospital had taken only men , he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy ; but he had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and homes . 
7604	br-k14	26	82	168970	He was able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes . 
7605	br-k14	27	83	168986	He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together : a Mary who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; and a Jesus who , though lean , was strong even in death - a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead_room of Santo_Spirito . 
7606	br-k14	27	84	169044	He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches . 
7607	br-k14	28	85	169063	Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional_figure in clay . 
7608	br-k14	28	86	169075	Here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms . 
7609	br-k14	28	87	169091	When he wanted to emphasize , or get greater intensity , he added or subtracted clay . 
7610	br-k14	28	88	169108	Next he turned_to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence . 
7611	br-k14	28	89	169127	He respected each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character : 
7612	br-k14	28	90	169141	his quill drawings had a scratchiness , suggesting skin texture ; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; the wax he smoothed_over to give the body surface an elastic pull . 
7613	br-k14	28	91	169186	Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; they remained rough starting_points . 
7614	br-k14	28	92	169204	When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy ; too_careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model . 
7615	br-k14	29	93	169234	The true surge had to be inside the marble itself . 
7616	br-k14	29	94	169245	Drawing and models were his thinking . 
7617	br-k14	29	95	169252	Carving was action . 
7618	br-k14	30	96	169256	The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice . 
7619	br-k14	30	97	169278	Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every_day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal . 
7620	br-k14	31	98	169331	`` Argiento , this is senseless '' , he complained , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold_weather . 
7621	br-k14	31	99	169355	`` You 're too clean . 
7622	br-k14	31	100	169361	Scrub the studio once a week . 
7623	br-k14	31	101	169368	That 's enough '' . 
7624	br-k14	32	102	169373	`` No '' , said Argiento stolidly . 
7625	br-k14	32	103	169381	`` Every_day . 
7626	br-k14	32	104	169384	Before dawn . 
7627	br-k14	32	105	169387	I was taught '' . 
7628	br-k14	33	106	169392	`` And God help anyone who tries to unteach you '' ! 
7629	br-k14	33	107	169404	grumbled Michelangelo ; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about , for Argiento made few demands on him . 
7630	br-k14	33	108	169426	The boy was becoming acquainted_with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome . 
7631	br-k14	33	109	169440	On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in_particular to see their horses . 
7632	br-k14	33	110	169461	The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po_Valley was the animals ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by announcing : 
7633	br-k14	34	111	169487	`` Today I go see the horses '' . 
7634	br-k14	35	112	169496	It took a piece of bad_luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him . 
7635	br-k14	35	113	169513	He was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil . 
7636	br-k14	35	114	169544	He stumbled into the house , eyes burning like fire . 
7637	br-k14	35	115	169555	Argiento made him lie_down on the bed , brought a pan of hot water , dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter . 
7638	br-k14	35	116	169584	Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned . 
7639	br-k14	35	117	169595	He assumed he could blink the splinter out . 
7640	br-k14	35	118	169604	But it would not come . 
7641	br-k14	35	119	169610	Argiento never left his side , keeping the water boiled , applying hot compresses throughout the night . 
7642	br-k14	36	120	169628	By the second day Michelangelo began to worry ; and by the second night he was in a state of panic : he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye . 
7643	br-k14	36	121	169660	At dawn Argiento went_to Jacopo_Galli . 
7644	br-k14	36	122	169666	Galli arrived with his family surgeon , Maestro_Lippi . 
7645	br-k14	36	123	169675	The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons . 
7646	br-k14	36	124	169684	He told Argiento to take a bird out of the cage , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood gush into Michelangelo 's injured eye . 
7647	br-k14	37	125	169714	The surgeon came_back at dusk , cut the vein of a second pigeon , again washed out the eye . 
7648	br-k15	1	1	169734	Beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps . 
7649	br-k15	1	2	169747	The thin legs twitched convulsively once , then Kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound . 
7650	br-k15	1	3	169770	The scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands . 
7651	br-k15	1	4	169780	The child was gone . 
7652	br-k15	2	5	169785	When Juanita awoke , Kate was still rocking the dead child , still crooning in disbelief , `` No , no , oh , no ! '' 
7653	br-k15	2	6	169812	They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent_for the young Presbyterian minister . 
7654	br-k15	2	7	169827	He sat beside Kate 's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God 's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him . 
7655	br-k15	2	8	169856	When he told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words rebelliously . 
7656	br-k15	3	9	169874	Few of the neighbors came , but Mrs._Tussle came , called by tragedy . 
7657	br-k15	3	10	169888	`` It always comes in threes '' , she sighed heavily . 
7658	br-k15	3	11	169900	`` Trouble never comes but in threes '' . 
7659	br-k15	4	12	169909	They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot . 
7660	br-k15	4	13	169931	Kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment . 
7661	br-k15	4	14	169945	She would not accept the death of such a little child . 
7662	br-k15	4	15	169957	`` God called her to Him '' , the minister had said . 
7663	br-k15	4	16	169970	God would not do that , Kate thought stubbornly . 
7664	br-k15	5	17	169980	Jonathan 's letter came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child 's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself . 
7665	br-k15	5	18	170010	In blind panic of grief she accepted Jonathan 's dictum , and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by God . 
7666	br-k15	5	19	170034	She held Jonathan 's letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed . 
7667	br-k15	5	20	170058	She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son . 
7668	br-k15	5	21	170072	Joel came and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain and anguish , averting his eyes from the ice_packs on her bosom . 
7669	br-k15	6	22	170096	Juanita and Mrs._Tussle kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried . 
7670	br-k15	6	23	170110	When she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty . 
7671	br-k15	6	24	170130	She disciplined herself daily to do what must be done . 
7672	br-k15	6	25	170141	She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the nurse 's room off the empty nursery , although the girl tried to insist on moving_back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of the baby 's death . 
7673	br-k15	7	26	170181	Juanita drooped about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which Kate attributed to the baby 's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to `` Miss_Juanita_Fitzroy '' , bearing a Grafton postmark . 
7674	br-k15	7	27	170222	Seeing the slanting hand , Kate knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel . 
7675	br-k15	7	28	170238	The Federal forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving to take all the mountains . 
7676	br-k15	7	29	170258	Kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended , at what involvement existed for Juanita . 
7677	br-k15	8	30	170279	Uncle_Randolph and Joel had replanted the bottom_lands with difficulty , for more of the slaves , including Annie , had sneaked_off when the soldiers broke_camp . 
7678	br-k15	8	31	170305	Joel worked like a field_hand in the afternoons after school . 
7679	br-k15	8	32	170316	He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers_Ferry . 
7680	br-k15	8	33	170330	Kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss . 
7681	br-k15	8	34	170342	She loved him and missed his company . 
7682	br-k15	9	35	170350	Uncle_Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own . 
7683	br-k15	9	36	170365	What it was Kate could not fathom . 
7684	br-k15	9	37	170373	He claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his cronies , but Kate had not smelled brandy on him since Mrs._Lattimer 's funeral . 
7685	br-k15	9	38	170406	Joel knew what he was_about , however . 
7686	br-k15	10	39	170414	`` You 're gonna get caught '' , she heard Joel say to Uncle_Randolph by the pump one morning . 
7687	br-k15	11	40	170434	`` Not this old fox '' , chuckled Uncle_Randolph . 
7688	br-k15	11	41	170444	`` Everybody knows I'm just a harmless , deaf old_man who takes_to drink . 
7689	br-k15	11	42	170458	I aim to keep a_little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure '' . 
7690	br-k15	12	43	170474	`` Whisky still , my_foot '' , said Joel . 
7691	br-k15	12	44	170484	`` You 're back there riding with the guerrillas , the Moccasin_Rangers '' . 
7692	br-k15	13	45	170498	`` Hush '' , said Uncle_Randolph , smiling , `` or I 'll give you another black_eye '' . 
7693	br-k15	13	46	170517	He patted the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back . 
7694	br-k15	14	47	170538	Kate had no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night , had heard horsemen on the River_Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn . 
7695	br-k15	14	48	170582	Stranger , Uncle_Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle , drunkenly singing `` Old_Dan_Tucker '' at the top of his voice . 
7696	br-k15	14	49	170609	Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road , Kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house , cold_sober . 
7697	br-k15	14	50	170636	What he was_about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by General_McClellan , threatening reprisals against Rebel guerrillas . 
7698	br-k15	14	51	170659	She was taken_up in worry for the reckless old_man . 
7699	br-k15	15	52	170669	Kate drew more_and_more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work . 
7700	br-k15	15	53	170685	She had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw Miss_Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom . 
7701	br-k15	15	54	170722	Kate had walked past the school on her morning chores and had seen the whole incident , had seen Joel 's burning humiliation before Miss_Snow 's cold , bespectacled wrath . 
7702	br-k15	15	55	170753	He had the hardest pains of growing before him now , as he approached twelve . 
7703	br-k15	15	56	170769	These would be his hardest years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately . 
7704	br-k15	16	57	170786	She tried to find some way to draw him out , to help him . 
7705	br-k15	16	58	170801	Whenever she found time , she went blackberry picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths purple , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day . 
7706	br-k15	16	59	170837	He tended the new colts Beau had sired . 
7707	br-k15	16	60	170846	He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower_garden in the side_yard , where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees working against the summer 's purple dusk . 
7708	br-k15	17	61	170879	No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle_Randolph . 
7709	br-k15	17	62	170890	They stayed in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the peddler , bringing the news . 
7710	br-k15	17	63	170911	Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers_Ferry before they abandoned it ; of their first engagement at Falling_Waters after Old_Jack 's First_Brigade had destroyed all the rolling_stock of the B_+_O_Railroad . 
7711	br-k15	17	64	170943	The men were restive , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished . 
7712	br-k15	18	65	170963	The peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in Wheeling , Which had formed a new state_government by declaring the government at Richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors . 
7713	br-k15	18	66	170999	Dangling his gaudy trinkets before them , he told of the Rebel losses in the mountains , at Cheat and Rich mountains both , and the Federal march on Beverly . 
7714	br-k15	19	67	171030	`` Cleaned all them Rebs out'n the hills , they did ! 
7715	br-k15	19	68	171042	They won't never git over inter loyal western Virginia , them traitors ! 
7716	br-k15	19	69	171055	The Federals is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too '' , he crowed . 
7717	br-k15	20	70	171074	After he had gone , Kate asked Uncle_Randolph proudly , `` Would you take their oath '' ? 
7718	br-k15	21	71	171092	And the old_man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said , `` Hell , yes ! 
7719	br-k15	21	72	171110	I think I 've taken it about fifty times already '' ! winking at Joel 's look of shock . 
7720	br-k15	22	73	171130	Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate 's baby and at Jonathan 's decision to go_with the South `` And , dear Kate '' , she wrote , `` poor Dr._Breckenridge 's son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go South , to his good father 's sorrow . 
7721	br-k15	22	74	171186	Maj._Anderson of Fort_Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the U.S._Army . 
7722	br-k15	22	75	171198	In_spite of the fact that the state_legislature voted us neutral , John_Hunt_Morgan is openly flying the Confederate_flag over his woolen factory '' ! 
7723	br-k15	23	76	171221	Rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley . 
7724	br-k15	23	77	171234	Accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg for the news . 
7725	br-k15	24	78	171253	`` All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas_Junction and it were a big fight '' , the old_man told them . 
7726	br-k15	25	79	171277	In the next few days they had cause to rejoice . 
7727	br-k15	25	80	171288	It had been a big battle , and the Confederate forces had won . 
7728	br-k15	25	81	171302	Jonathan and Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing . 
7729	br-k15	25	82	171320	Kate and Mrs._Tussle waited for letters anxiously . 
7730	br-k15	25	83	171328	Joel went_to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate . 
7731	br-k15	25	84	171347	When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful . 
7732	br-k15	25	85	171380	They all prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come , for Virginia had defended her land victoriously . 
7733	br-k15	26	86	171402	The week after Manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon 's rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window . 
7734	br-k15	26	87	171434	They had already lost most_of their corn , she thought . 
7735	br-k15	26	88	171445	Were they to be insulted again because of the South 's great victory ? 
7736	br-k15	26	89	171459	She remembered McClellan 's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs . 
7737	br-k15	27	90	171473	At the landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front_door . 
7738	br-k15	27	91	171498	Juanita stopped just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth . 
7739	br-k15	27	92	171512	As Kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel_Marsh framed_in the doorway , his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore . 
7740	br-k15	27	93	171540	Kate greeted him gravely , uneasy with misgivings at his visit . 
7741	br-k15	28	94	171552	`` What brings you here again , Colonel_Marsh '' ? she asked , taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun . 
7742	br-k15	29	95	171582	`` I stopped to say goodbye , Mrs._Lattimer , and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby . 
7743	br-k15	29	96	171605	I wish our doctor could have saved her '' . 
7744	br-k15	30	97	171615	`` It was a terrible loss to me '' , said Kate quietly , feeling the pain twist again at the mention , knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton . 
7745	br-k15	30	98	171650	`` Where will you go now that you 're leaving Parkersburg '' ? 
7746	br-k15	30	99	171663	she asked him , seeing Juanita 's eyes grow bleak . 
7747	br-k15	31	100	171674	`` As you know , General_McClellan has been occupying Beverly . 
7748	br-k15	31	101	171685	He has notified me that he has orders to go_to Washington to take_over the Army_of_the_Potomac . 
7749	br-k15	31	102	171701	I am to go_to Washington to serve with him '' . 
7750	br-k15	32	103	171712	`` When are you to leave '' ? 
7751	br-k15	32	104	171720	Kate asked , watching them both now anxiously . 
7752	br-k15	32	105	171729	Their eyes betrayed too_much of their emotions , she thought sadly . 
7753	br-k15	33	106	171741	`` Tomorrow . 
7754	br-k15	33	107	171744	Would you permit Juanita to walk_about the grounds with me for a short spell , Mrs._Lattimer '' ? 
7755	br-k15	34	108	171762	`` Stay here in the parlor where it 's cool '' , she said , trying to be calm . 
7756	br-k15	34	109	171782	It would be better for Joel and Uncle_Randolph and Mrs._Tussle not to see them . 
7757	br-k15	35	110	171797	Kate went_back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations . 
7758	br-k15	35	111	171809	Then she took iced lemonade to Marsh 's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower_garden . 
7759	br-k15	35	112	171833	When Marsh called to his aide and the pair rode_off down the River_Road where the gentians burned blue , Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry . 
7760	br-k15	35	113	171861	She sought Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling . 
7761	br-k15	36	114	171871	`` He wants me to go with him tomorrow '' , she told Kate . 
7762	br-k15	37	115	171886	`` What do you want to do '' ? 
7763	br-k15	37	116	171895	Kate asked , uneasy at the gravity of the girl 's dilemma . 
7764	br-k15	38	117	171908	`` I could go with him . 
7765	br-k15	38	118	171915	He knows me as your niece , which , of_course , I am . 
7766	br-k15	38	119	171929	But I am a slave ! 
7767	br-k15	38	120	171935	You own me . 
7768	br-k15	38	121	171939	It 's your decision '' , said Juanita , holding her face very still , trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly . 
7769	br-k15	39	122	171970	`` No , the decision is yours . 
7770	br-k15	39	123	171978	I have held your papers of manumission since I married Mr._Lattimer '' . 
7771	br-k16	1	1	171991	The red glow from the cove had died_out of the sky . 
7772	br-k16	1	2	172003	The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no_more . 
7773	br-k16	1	3	172036	The things left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell_back on the well stuffed pillows . 
7774	br-k16	1	4	172057	Anita put_out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty_of images . 
7775	br-k16	1	5	172102	They slept - Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table . 
7776	br-k16	2	6	172124	In the ballroom below , the dark had given_way to moonlight coming_in through the bank of French_windows . 
7777	br-k16	2	7	172142	It was a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky . 
7778	br-k16	2	8	172165	Martha_Schuyler , old , slow , careful of foot , came_down the great staircase , dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk , her jeweled shoe buckles held forward . 
7779	br-k16	3	9	172195	`` Well , I'm here at_last '' , she said , addressing the old portraits on the walls . 
7780	br-k16	3	10	172214	`` I do n't hear the music . 
7781	br-k16	3	11	172222	I am getting deaf , I must admit it '' . 
7782	br-k16	4	12	172233	She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it . 
7783	br-k16	4	13	172251	`` Where is everyone ? 
7784	br-k16	4	14	172256	I_say , where is everyone ? 
7785	br-k16	4	15	172262	Peter , you lummox , you 've forgot to order the musicians '' . 
7786	br-k16	5	16	172276	She stood there , a large old_woman , smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning , this big foolish baby of a son . 
7787	br-k16	5	17	172305	There were times now , like this , when she lost_control of the time count and moved freely back_and_forth into three generations . 
7788	br-k16	5	18	172328	Was it a birthday ball ? 
7789	br-k16	5	19	172334	When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen ? 
7790	br-k16	5	20	172343	Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a Van_Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany , from Rensselaerwyck . 
7791	br-k16	5	21	172369	And this handsome booby , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom ? 
7792	br-k16	6	22	172383	Martha picked_up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom . 
7793	br-k16	7	23	172406	David_Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh . 
7794	br-k16	7	24	172417	He had ridden hard from Boston , and he was not used_to horseback . 
7795	br-k16	7	25	172431	Now , driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer_Schuyler , he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move . 
7796	br-k16	8	26	172474	The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather_than the Hudson_River Valley of his boyhood memories . 
7797	br-k16	8	27	172512	He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held_on as the sulky 's wheels hit a pothole and came_out with a jolt and went_on . 
7798	br-k16	8	28	172542	He would cross to Manhattan , to Harlem_Heights , before morning . 
7799	br-k16	8	29	172554	There a certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons_of_Liberty . 
7800	br-k16	8	30	172565	He would send_on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news . 
7801	br-k16	8	31	172578	And he would sleep , sleep , and never think_of roads and horses ' sore haunches , of colonial wars . 
7802	br-k16	9	32	172599	Strange how everything here fitted back into his life , even if he had been away so long . 
7803	br-k16	9	33	172618	Mynheer , Sir_Francis , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon drenched road . 
7804	br-k16	9	34	172656	A mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace . 
7805	br-k16	10	35	172676	Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads . 
7806	br-k16	10	36	172688	David reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet . 
7807	br-k16	10	37	172702	He pulled_out one of them and cocked it . 
7808	br-k16	10	38	172711	A strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes . 
7809	br-k16	10	39	172725	It was a grotesque hen , five or six feet tall . 
7810	br-k16	10	40	172737	It had the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers . 
7811	br-k16	10	41	172751	It ran , this apocalyptic beast , on two thin legs , and its wings - were they feathered arms ? 
7812	br-k16	10	42	172772	- flapped as it ran . 
7813	br-k16	10	43	172778	Its groin was bloody . 
7814	br-k16	10	44	172783	Black strips of skin hung from it . 
7815	br-k16	11	45	172791	The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils . 
7816	br-k16	11	46	172803	David took_a_firm_hand with it . 
7817	br-k16	11	47	172808	The creature in feathers looked_around and David saw the mad eyes , glazed with an insane fear . 
7818	br-k16	11	48	172826	The ungainly bird thing ran_away , and to David its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster . 
7819	br-k16	11	49	172846	Then it was gone . 
7820	br-k16	11	50	172851	He drove on , wary and shaken . 
7821	br-k16	11	51	172859	The Sons were out tonight . 
7822	br-k16	12	52	172865	New_York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish_hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan_Island . 
7823	br-k16	12	53	172894	It was thickly_settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid_out into pig infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall_Street , but giving_up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem_Heights . 
7824	br-k16	12	54	172932	From there it looked_across at Westchester_County and the Hudson_River where the manor_houses , estates , and big farms of the original ( non Indian ) landowners began . 
7825	br-k16	13	55	172960	On the east_side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the East_River that connected New_York_Bay with Long_Island_Sound . 
7826	br-k16	13	56	172980	On the western tip of Long_Island protruded Brooklyn_Heights . 
7827	br-k16	13	57	172989	It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor . 
7828	br-k16	13	58	172999	A fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights , and behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields . 
7829	br-k16	13	59	173024	Husbandry was bounded by snake-rail_fences , and there were grazing cattle . 
7830	br-k16	13	60	173036	On the shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers - smugglers - lived along the churning Great_South_Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire_Island . 
7831	br-k16	14	61	173064	The morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay , sheltered by the Jersey inlets . 
7832	br-k16	14	62	173102	They often threw tidbits overboard . 
7833	br-k16	14	63	173108	The larger ships were near Paulus_Hook , already being called , by a_few , Jersey_City . 
7834	br-k16	14	64	173124	These were the ships of His Majesty 's Navy , herding the hulks of the East_Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists . 
7835	br-k16	14	65	173150	The news of battle on Breed_'s_Hill had already seeped through , and New_York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial_Congress . 
7836	br-k16	14	66	173175	The fish_hawk , his wings not moving , circled and glided lower . 
7837	br-k16	14	67	173188	The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him , the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black , the bronze cannon at the ports . 
7838	br-k16	14	68	173219	The captain 's gig of H.M.S._Mercury was being rowed to H.M.S._Neptune . 
7839	br-k16	15	69	173231	On shore `` the freed slaves to despotism '' - the town dwellers - watched the ships and waited . 
7840	br-k16	15	70	173251	The chevaux_de_frise , those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery , pointed to a conflict between the town and sea_power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came_in . 
7841	br-k16	15	71	173284	Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber ; their rock paths led down to the Hudson . 
7842	br-k16	15	72	173304	Below in the open bay facing Manhattan was Staten_Island , gritty with clam_shells and mud_flats behind which nested farms , cattle barns , and berry thickets . 
7843	br-k16	15	73	173331	Along Wappinger_Creek in Dutchess_County , past the white church at Fishkill , past Verplanck_'s_Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white salt crusted roads of the Long_Island_Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing_for something explosive to happen . 
7844	br-k16	15	74	173376	Today , tomorrow , six months , even perhaps a year . 
7845	br-k16	16	75	173388	The fish_hawk flew_on and was lost from sight . 
7846	br-k16	16	76	173397	The British ships rolled at anchor , sent_out picket_boats and waited for orders from London . 
7847	br-k16	16	77	173413	Waited for more ships , more lobster-backed infantry , and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion ? 
7848	br-k16	17	78	173435	David_Cortlandt , having slept away a day and a night , came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem_River near Spuyten_Duyvil . 
7849	br-k16	17	79	173458	He looked_out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather , looked_out at King_'s_Bridge toward Westchester . 
7850	br-k16	17	80	173477	The road seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual ; a carriage raising_up the choking June dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local militia company drilling with muskets , Kentuck ' rifles , every kind of horse pistol , old sword , or cutlass . 
7851	br-k16	18	81	173528	The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David 's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston . 
7852	br-k16	18	82	173562	Pensive , introspective , he ached . 
7853	br-k16	18	83	173569	He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept . 
7854	br-k16	18	84	173583	Now there was more to do . 
7855	br-k16	18	85	173590	Orders not written_down had_to be transmitted to the local provincial government . 
7856	br-k16	18	86	173602	He scratched his mosquito plagued neck . 
7857	br-k16	19	87	173609	From the saddlebags , hung_on a Hitchcock_chair , David took_out a good English razor , a present from John_Hunter . 
7858	br-k16	19	88	173629	He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost . 
7859	br-k16	19	89	173670	He hoped he was free_of self-deception . 
7860	br-k16	20	90	173677	Here he was , suddenly caught_up in the delirium of a war , in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories . 
7861	br-k16	20	91	173700	There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war . 
7862	br-k16	20	92	173726	David_Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface . 
7863	br-k16	20	93	173744	He knew that many were using it for their own ends . 
7864	br-k16	20	94	173756	But it did not matter . 
7865	br-k16	20	95	173762	He stropped the razor slowly ; what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was being born . 
7866	br-k16	20	96	173781	That some men did not want it he could understand . 
7867	br-k16	20	97	173792	The moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers . 
7868	br-k16	20	98	173805	Yet some , like Morris_Manderscheid , would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas . 
7869	br-k16	20	99	173819	Unique circumstances would test us all , he decided . 
7870	br-k16	20	100	173829	Injury and ingratitude would occur . 
7871	br-k16	20	101	173835	No_doubt John_Hancock would do well now ; war was a smugglers ' heaven . 
7872	br-k16	20	102	173849	And what of that poor tarred_and_feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from Schuyler 's ? 
7873	br-k16	20	103	173868	Things like that would increase rather_than be done_away_with . 
7874	br-k16	20	104	173877	One had_to believe_in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing . 
7875	br-k16	20	105	173892	He saw with John_Hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream . 
7876	br-k16	20	106	173906	Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows . 
7877	br-k16	20	107	173915	David began to shave with great sweeping strokes . 
7878	br-k16	21	108	173924	Time plays an essential part in our mortality , and suddenly for no reason he could imagine ( or admit ) the image of Peg laughing filled his mind - so desirable , so lusty , so full of nuances of pleasure and joy . 
7879	br-k16	21	109	173969	He drove sensual patterns off , carefully shaving his long upper lip . 
7880	br-k16	21	110	173982	It is harder , he muttered , to meditate on man ( or woman ) than on God . 
7881	br-k16	22	111	174001	David finished shaving , washed his face clean of lather , and combed and retied his hair . 
7882	br-k16	22	112	174019	He was proud that he had never worn a wig . 
7883	br-k16	22	113	174030	More_and_more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder . 
7884	br-k16	22	114	174044	He felt cheerful again , refreshed ; presentable in his wide-cut brown suit , the well-made riding_boots . 
7885	br-k16	23	115	174062	It is so easy to falsify sentiment . 
7886	br-k16	23	116	174070	In the meadow below , militia officers shouted at their men and on King_'s_Bridge two boys sat fishing . 
7887	br-k16	23	117	174089	The future would happen ; he did not have_to hurry it by thinking too_much . 
7888	br-k16	23	118	174104	A man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days . 
7889	br-k16	23	119	174121	He began to pack the saddlebags . 
7890	br-k16	23	120	174128	And all this too shall pass_away : it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church_service when he was a boy - yes , in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal Hudson_Valley , where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those English Dutch manors with their well-fed squires . 
7891	br-k17	1	1	174188	Burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried_on in a primitive way , almost unchanged from feudal times . 
7892	br-k17	1	2	174210	Peasants puzzled Andrei . 
7893	br-k17	1	3	174214	He wondered how they could go_on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish . 
7894	br-k17	2	4	174243	Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long_ago . 
7895	br-k17	2	5	174250	Tolek_Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine and , before the national leadership , exalted the miracles of drying_up swamps and irrigating the desert . 
7896	br-k17	2	6	174276	A fund-raising_drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched . 
7897	br-k17	2	7	174286	Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference . 
7898	br-k17	3	8	174298	Had he found the meaning too late ? 
7899	br-k17	3	9	174306	It aggravated him . 
7900	br-k17	3	10	174310	The land of the Lublin_Uplands was rich , but no_one seemed to care . 
7901	br-k17	3	11	174324	In the unfertile land in Palestine humans broke their backs pushing will_power to the brink . 
7902	br-k17	4	12	174340	He had sat beside Alexander_Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists . 
7903	br-k17	4	13	174354	All_of them were there in this loosely_knit association of diversified ideologies , and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches . 
7904	br-k17	4	14	174380	When Alexander_Brandel rose to speak , the hall became silent . 
7905	br-k17	5	15	174391	`` I do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism . 
7906	br-k17	5	16	174417	We are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest , seeking human dignity . 
7907	br-k17	5	17	174437	Beyond the forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren , eroded hills of Judea . 
7908	br-k17	5	18	174460	This is our singular goal . 
7909	br-k17	5	19	174466	How we travel through the forest is for each man 's conscience . 
7910	br-k17	5	20	174479	Where we end our journey is always the same . 
7911	br-k17	5	21	174489	We all seek the same thing through different ways - an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star_of_David flies over Zion '' . 
7912	br-k17	5	22	174528	This was how Alexander_Brandel expressed pure Zionism . 
7913	br-k17	5	23	174536	It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it . 
7914	br-k17	5	24	174550	In his heart he had no desire to go_to Palestine . 
7915	br-k17	5	25	174561	He loathed the idea of drying_up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright . 
7916	br-k17	6	26	174580	Before he went_into battle Andrei had told Alex , `` I only want to be a Pole . 
7917	br-k17	6	27	174598	Warsaw is my city , not Tel_Aviv '' . 
7918	br-k17	7	28	174607	And now Andrei sat on a train on_the_way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief . 
7919	br-k17	7	29	174631	Warsaw ! 
7920	br-k17	7	30	174633	He saw the smug eyes of the Home_Army chief , Roman , and all the Romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him . 
7921	br-k17	7	31	174662	They had let this black_hole of death in Warsaw 's heart exist without a cry of protest . 
7922	br-k17	8	32	174680	Once there had been big glittering rooms where Ulanys bowed and kissed the ladies ' hands as they flirted from behind their fans . 
7923	br-k17	9	33	174704	Warsaw ! 
7924	br-k17	9	34	174706	Warsaw ! 
7925	br-k17	10	35	174708	`` Miss_Rak . 
7926	br-k17	10	36	174711	I am a Jew '' . 
7927	br-k17	11	37	174717	Day_by_day , week_by_week , month_by_month , the betrayal gnawed_at Andrei 's heart . 
7928	br-k17	11	38	174730	He ground his teeth together . 
7929	br-k17	11	39	174736	I hate Warsaw , he said to himself . 
7930	br-k17	11	40	174745	I hate Poland and all the goddamned mothers ' sons of them . 
7931	br-k17	11	41	174758	All_of Poland is a coffin . 
7932	br-k17	12	42	174764	The terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind . 
7933	br-k17	12	43	174775	What matters now ? 
7934	br-k17	12	44	174779	What is beyond this fog ? 
7935	br-k17	12	45	174785	Only Palestine , and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe . 
7936	br-k17	13	46	174802	By late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin , which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the Russian front . 
7937	br-k17	14	47	174837	At a siding , another train which was a familiar sight these days . 
7938	br-k17	14	48	174851	Deportees . 
7939	br-k17	14	49	174853	Jews . 
7940	br-k17	14	50	174855	Andrei 's skilled eye sized them up . 
7941	br-k17	14	51	174863	They were not Poles . 
7942	br-k17	14	52	174868	He guessed by their appearance that they were Rumanians . 
7943	br-k17	15	53	174878	He walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka . 
7944	br-k17	15	54	174893	Of all the places in Poland , Andrei hated Lublin the most . 
7945	br-k17	15	55	174906	The Bathyrans were all gone . 
7946	br-k17	15	56	174912	Few of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto . 
7947	br-k17	16	57	174928	From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal_point . 
7948	br-k17	16	58	174939	He and Ana watched it carefully . 
7949	br-k17	16	59	174946	Lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere . 
7950	br-k17	16	60	174957	Early in 1939 , Odilo_Globocnik , the Gauleiter of Vienna , established SS headquarters for all_of Poland . 
7951	br-k17	16	61	174975	The Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug_of_war with Hans_Frank and the civilian administrators . 
7952	br-k17	17	62	175000	Globocnik built the Death's-Head_Corps . 
7953	br-k17	17	63	175005	Lublin was the seed of action for the `` final solution '' of the Jewish problem . 
7954	br-k17	17	64	175022	As the messages from Himmler , Heydrich , and Eichmann came_in through Alfred_Funk , Lublin 's fountainhead spouted . 
7955	br-k17	18	65	175041	A bevy of interlacing lagers , work_camps , concentration_camps erupted in the area . 
7956	br-k17	18	66	175055	Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners_of_war disappeared into Lublin 's web . 
7957	br-k17	18	67	175065	Plans went in and out of Lublin , indicating German confusion . 
7958	br-k17	18	68	175077	A tale of a massive reservation in the Uplands to hold several million Jews . 
7959	br-k17	18	69	175092	A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to the island of Madagascar . 
7960	br-k17	18	70	175107	Stories of the depravity of the guards at Globocnik 's camps struck_a_chord of terror at the mere mention of their names . 
7961	br-k17	18	71	175129	Lipowa_7 , Sobibor , Chelmno , Poltawa , Belzec , Krzywy-Rog , Budzyn , Krasnik . 
7962	br-k17	18	72	175145	Ice baths , electric_shocks , lashings , wild_dogs , testicle crushers . 
7963	br-k17	19	73	175157	The Death's-Head_Corps took_in Ukrainian and Baltic_Auxiliaries , and the Einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep in blood and turned_into drunken , dope ridden maniacs . 
7964	br-k17	19	74	175179	Lublin was their heart . 
7965	br-k17	20	75	175184	In the spring of 1942 Operation_Reinhard began in Lublin . 
7966	br-k17	20	76	175194	The ghetto , a miniature of Warsaw 's , was emptied into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called Majdanek . 
7967	br-k17	20	77	175215	As the camp emptied , it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around Lublin , then by deportees from outside Poland . 
7968	br-k17	20	78	175241	In and in and in they poured through the gates of Majdanek , but they never left , and Majdanek was not growing any larger . 
7969	br-k17	21	79	175267	What was happening in Majdanek ? 
7970	br-k17	21	80	175273	Was Operation_Reinhard the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw ? 
7971	br-k17	21	81	175289	Was there another Majdanek in the Warsaw area , as they suspected ? 
7972	br-k17	22	82	175302	Andrei stopped at Litowski_Place and looked_around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings . 
7973	br-k17	22	83	175316	His watch told him he was still early . 
7974	br-k17	22	84	175325	Down the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall . 
7975	br-k17	22	85	175338	He found an empty bench , opened a newspaper , and stretched his legs before him . 
7976	br-k17	22	86	175355	Krakow_Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their Auxiliaries . 
7977	br-k17	23	87	175371	`` Captain_Androfski '' ! 
7978	br-k17	24	88	175375	Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the mustached , homely face of Sergeant_Styka . 
7979	br-k17	24	89	175395	Styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly . 
7980	br-k17	24	90	175405	`` I have been waiting across the street at the post_office since dawn . 
7981	br-k17	24	91	175419	I thought you might get_in on a morning train '' . 
7982	br-k17	25	92	175430	`` It 's good to see you again , Styka '' . 
7983	br-k17	26	93	175442	Styka studied his captain . 
7984	br-k17	26	94	175447	He almost broke_into tears . 
7985	br-k17	26	95	175452	To him , Andrei_Androfski had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer . 
7986	br-k17	26	96	175467	His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby . 
7987	br-k17	27	97	175482	`` Remember to call me Jan '' , Andrei said . 
7988	br-k17	28	98	175493	Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously . 
7989	br-k17	28	99	175503	`` When that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war '' . 
7990	br-k17	29	100	175527	`` I'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin '' . 
7991	br-k17	30	101	175539	Styka grumbled about fate . 
7992	br-k17	30	102	175544	`` For a time I thought_of trying to reach the Free_Polish_Forces , but one thing led to another . 
7993	br-k17	30	103	175563	I got a girl in_trouble and we had_to get_married . 
7994	br-k17	30	104	175573	Not a bad girl . 
7995	br-k17	30	105	175578	So we have three children and responsibilities . 
7996	br-k17	30	106	175586	I work at the granary . 
7997	br-k17	30	107	175592	Nothing like the old days in the army , but I get_by . 
7998	br-k17	30	108	175605	Who complains ? 
7999	br-k17	30	109	175608	Many times I tried to reach you , but I never knew how . 
8000	br-k17	30	110	175622	I came to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall '' . 
8001	br-k17	31	111	175637	`` I understand '' . 
8002	br-k17	32	112	175642	Styka blew his nose again . 
8003	br-k17	33	113	175648	`` Were you able to make the arrangements '' ? 
8004	br-k17	33	114	175658	Andrei asked . 
8005	br-k17	34	115	175661	`` There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in_charge_of the bricklayers at Majdanek . 
8006	br-k17	34	116	175678	I did exactly as instructed . 
8007	br-k17	34	117	175684	I told him you are on orders from the Home_Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a report to the government_in_exile in London '' . 
8008	br-k17	35	118	175711	`` His answer '' ? 
8009	br-k17	36	119	175716	`` Ten_thousand zlotys '' . 
8010	br-k17	37	120	175721	`` Can he be trusted '' ? 
8011	br-k17	38	121	175728	`` He is aware he will not live for twenty-four_hours if he betrays you '' . 
8012	br-k17	39	122	175744	`` Good man , Styka '' . 
8013	br-k17	40	123	175751	`` Captain_Jan , must you go inside Majdanek ? 
8014	br-k17	40	124	175760	The stories . 
8015	br-k17	40	125	175763	Everyone really knows what is happening there '' . 
8016	br-k17	41	126	175772	`` Not everyone , Styka '' . 
8017	br-k17	42	127	175779	`` What good will it really do '' ? 
8018	br-k17	43	128	175788	`` I do n't know . 
8019	br-k17	43	129	175794	Perhaps - perhaps - there is a shred of conscience left in the human_race . 
8020	br-k17	43	130	175809	Perhaps if they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation '' . 
8021	br-k17	44	131	175825	`` Do you really believe that , Jan '' ? 
8022	br-k17	45	132	175835	`` I have_to believe it '' . 
8023	br-k17	46	133	175842	Styka shook his head slowly . 
8024	br-k17	46	134	175848	`` I am only a simple soldier . 
8025	br-k17	46	135	175856	I cannot think things out too well . 
8026	br-k17	46	136	175864	Until I was transferred into the Seventh_Ulanys I was like every other Pole in my feeling about Jews . 
8027	br-k17	46	137	175883	I hated you when I first came_in . 
8028	br-k17	46	138	175891	But my captain might have been a Jew , but he was n't a Jew . 
8029	br-k17	46	139	175907	What I mean is , he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys . 
8030	br-k17	46	140	175924	Hell , sir . 
8031	br-k17	46	141	175928	The men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name . 
8032	br-k17	46	142	175941	You never knew about it , but by God , we taught them respect for Captain_Androfski '' . 
8033	br-k17	47	143	175959	Andrei smiled . 
8034	br-k17	48	144	175962	`` Since the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think , Holy_Mother , we have behaved like this for hundreds of years . 
8035	br-k17	48	145	175991	Why '' ? 
8036	br-k17	49	146	175994	`` How can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind_man to see '' ? 
8037	br-k17	50	147	176011	`` But we are neither blind nor insane . 
8038	br-k17	50	148	176020	The men of your company would not allow your name dishonored . 
8039	br-k17	50	149	176032	Why do we let the Germans do this '' ? 
8040	br-k17	51	150	176042	`` I have sat many hours with this , Styka . 
8041	br-k17	51	151	176053	All I ever wanted was to be a free_man in my own country . 
8042	br-k17	51	152	176067	I 've lost faith , Styka . 
8043	br-k17	51	153	176074	I used_to love this country and believe that someday we 'd win our battle for equality . 
8044	br-k17	51	154	176091	But now I think I hate it very_much '' . 
8045	br-k17	52	155	176101	`` And do you really think that the world outside Poland will care any more than we do '' ? 
8046	br-k17	53	156	176121	The question frightened Andrei . 
8047	br-k17	54	157	176126	`` Please do n't go inside Majdanek '' . 
8048	br-k17	55	158	176135	`` I'm still a soldier in a very small way , Styka '' . 
8049	br-k17	56	159	176149	It was an answer that Styka understood . 
8050	br-k17	57	160	176157	Grabski 's shanty was beyond the bridge over the River_Bystrzyca near the rail center . 
8051	br-k17	57	161	176172	Grabski sat in a sweat saturated undershirt , cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown . 
8052	br-k17	57	162	176192	He was a square brick of a man with a moon_round face and sunken Polish features . 
8053	br-k17	57	163	176209	Flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black_bread . 
8054	br-k17	57	164	176223	Half of it dripped down his chin . 
8055	br-k17	57	165	176231	He washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch . 
8056	br-k17	58	166	176243	`` Well '' ? 
8057	br-k17	58	167	176247	Andrei demanded . 
8058	br-k17	59	168	176250	Grabski looked at the pair of them . 
8059	br-k17	59	169	176258	He grunted a sort_of `` yes '' answer . 
8060	br-k17	59	170	176267	`` My cousin works at the Labor_Bureau . 
8061	br-k17	59	171	176275	He can make you work_papers . 
8062	br-k17	59	172	176281	It will take a_few days . 
8063	br-k17	59	173	176287	I will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew . 
8064	br-k17	59	174	176302	I do n't know if I can get you into the inner camp . 
8065	br-k17	59	175	176316	Maybe yes , maybe no , but you can observe everything from the roof of a barrack we are building '' . 
8066	br-k17	60	176	176338	Grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup_bowl . 
8067	br-k17	60	177	176349	`` Ca n't understand why the hell anyone wants_to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place '' . 
8068	br-k17	61	178	176365	`` Orders from the Home_Army '' . 
8069	br-k17	62	179	176372	`` Why ? 
8070	br-k17	62	180	176375	Nothing there but Jews '' . 
8071	br-k17	63	181	176381	Andrei shrugged . 
8072	br-k17	63	182	176384	`` We get strange orders '' . 
8073	br-k17	64	183	176391	`` Well - what about the money '' ? 
8074	br-k17	65	184	176400	Andrei peeled_off five one-thousand-zloty notes . 
8075	br-k17	65	185	176406	Grabski had never seen so much money . 
8076	br-k17	65	186	176414	His broad flat fingers , petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying , snatched the bills clumsily . 
8077	br-k17	65	187	176433	`` This ai n't enough '' . 
8078	br-k17	66	188	176440	`` You get the rest when I'm safely out of Majdanek '' . 
8079	br-k17	67	189	176453	`` I ai n't taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business '' . 
8080	br-k17	68	190	176467	Andrei and Styka were silent . 
8081	br-k18	1	1	176473	She was getting real dramatic . 
8082	br-k18	1	2	176479	I 'd have been more impressed if I had n't remembered that she 'd played Hedda_Gabler in her highschool dramatics course . 
8083	br-k18	1	3	176501	I did n't want her back on that broken record . 
8084	br-k18	2	4	176512	`` Nothing 's free in the whole goddam world '' , was all I could think_of to say . 
8085	br-k18	2	5	176531	When I 'd delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink . 
8086	br-k18	3	6	176550	`` I am '' , she said . 
8087	br-k18	4	7	176558	I 'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky_Derby and how it was Thelma 's fifty dollars I was spending . 
8088	br-k18	4	8	176579	It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used_to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch . 
8089	br-k18	4	9	176634	Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me . 
8090	br-k18	4	10	176649	I was crazy about her all over_again . 
8091	br-k18	4	11	176657	It was the call of the wild all_right . 
8092	br-k18	5	12	176666	That evening turned_out to be hell like all the others . 
8093	br-k18	5	13	176677	We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill . 
8094	br-k18	5	14	176686	It was the same old routine . 
8095	br-k18	5	15	176693	Eileen got_to dancing , just a_little tiny dancing step to a hummed tune that you could hardly notice , and trying to pick_up strange men , but each time I was ready to say to_hell_with_it and walk_out she 'd pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about the good times and the happiness we 'd had together and there I was back on_the_hook . 
8096	br-k18	6	16	176762	I did have the decency to call_up Thelma and tell her I 'd met old friends and would be home late . 
8097	br-k18	7	17	176784	`` I could scratch her eyes out '' , Eileen cried and stamped her foot when I came_back from the phone_booth . 
8098	br-k18	7	18	176806	`` You know I do n't like my men to have other women . 
8099	br-k18	7	19	176820	I hate it . 
8100	br-k18	7	20	176824	I hate it '' . 
8101	br-k18	8	21	176829	She got so drunk I had_to take her home . 
8102	br-k18	8	22	176839	It was a walk_up on Hudson_Street . 
8103	br-k18	8	23	176846	She just_about made me carry her upstairs and_then she clung_to me and would n't let me go . 
8104	br-k18	9	24	176864	There was a man 's jacket on the chair and a straw_hat on the table . 
8105	br-k18	9	25	176880	The place smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimp like characters use . 
8106	br-k18	9	26	176895	`` What about Ballestre '' ? 
8107	br-k18	9	27	176901	I had_to shake her to make her listen . 
8108	br-k18	9	28	176910	`` Precious . 
8109	br-k18	9	29	176913	What about him '' ? 
8110	br-k18	10	30	176918	Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic . 
8111	br-k18	10	31	176926	`` Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom . 
8112	br-k18	10	32	176936	We are above being jealous . 
8113	br-k18	10	33	176942	He 's used_to me bringing home strange men . 
8114	br-k18	10	34	176951	I 'll just tell him you 're my husband . 
8115	br-k18	10	35	176961	He can n't object to that '' . 
8116	br-k18	11	36	176969	`` Well I object . 
8117	br-k18	11	37	176974	If he pokes his nose in here I 'll slug him '' . 
8118	br-k18	12	38	176987	`` That really would be funny '' . 
8119	br-k18	13	39	176995	She began to laugh . 
8120	br-k18	13	40	177000	She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed . 
8121	br-k18	13	41	177016	After_all I'm made of flesh and blood . 
8122	br-k18	13	42	177024	I'm not a plaster_saint . 
8123	br-k18	14	43	177029	Waking_up was horrible . 
8124	br-k18	14	44	177033	Never in my life have I felt so remorseful about anything I 've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife . 
8125	br-k18	15	45	177059	We both had hangovers . 
8126	br-k18	15	46	177064	Eileen declared she could n't lift her head from the pillow . 
8127	br-k18	15	47	177076	She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look_for the coffeepot . 
8128	br-k18	15	48	177095	I was stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell . 
8129	br-k18	15	49	177119	There was somebody else in the apartment . 
8130	br-k18	16	50	177127	I stiffened . 
8131	br-k18	16	51	177130	Honest I could feel the hair stand_up on the back of my neck like a dog 's that is going_to get_into a fight . 
8132	br-k18	16	52	177154	I turned_around with the percolator in my hand . 
8133	br-k18	16	53	177163	My eyes were so bleary I could barely see him but there he was , a little smooth olivefaced guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffy colored fedora . 
8134	br-k18	16	54	177194	Brown eyes , eyebrow mustache . 
8135	br-k18	16	55	177200	Oval face without an expression in_the_world . 
8136	br-k18	17	56	177207	We did n't have time to speak before Eileen 's voice was screeching at us from the bed . 
8137	br-k18	17	57	177226	`` Joseph_Maria_Ballestre meet Francis_Xavier_Bowman . 
8138	br-k18	17	58	177231	Exboyfriend meet exhusband '' . 
8139	br-k18	17	59	177236	She gave the nastiest laugh I ever heard . 
8140	br-k18	17	60	177245	`` And do n't either of you forget that I'm not any man 's property . 
8141	br-k18	17	61	177261	If you want_to fight , go down on the sidewalk '' . 
8142	br-k18	17	62	177273	She was enjoying the situation . 
8143	br-k18	17	63	177279	Imagine that . 
8144	br-k18	18	64	177282	Eileen was a psychologist all_right . 
8145	br-k18	18	65	177288	Instead of wanting_to sock the poor bastard I found myself having a fellow-feeling for him . 
8146	br-k18	18	66	177304	Maybe he felt the same way . 
8147	br-k18	18	67	177311	I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life . 
8148	br-k18	18	68	177322	First thing I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking_up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffee-cup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers . 
8149	br-k18	19	69	177354	I could n't face Thelma after that night . 
8150	br-k18	19	70	177363	I did n't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone . 
8151	br-k18	19	71	177377	I wrote her that I 'd met_up_with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express . 
8152	br-k18	19	72	177404	Of_course I had_to give her Eileen 's address , but she never came_near us . 
8153	br-k18	19	73	177419	All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever . 
8154	br-k18	19	74	177451	She never said a word about the fifty dollars . 
8155	br-k18	19	75	177461	She added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking . 
8156	br-k18	19	76	177473	I must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times . 
8157	br-k18	20	77	177486	Afterwards I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away . 
8158	br-k18	20	78	177511	That finished me with Thelma . 
8159	br-k18	20	79	177517	Trust Eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation . 
8160	br-k18	21	80	177529	And there I was shacked_up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson_Street . 
8161	br-k18	21	81	177545	I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship . 
8162	br-k18	21	82	177560	I felt it and it ate_on me all_the_time , but I did n't know how right I was till later . 
8163	br-k18	22	83	177581	What I did know was that Precious was always around . 
8164	br-k18	22	84	177592	He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs . 
8165	br-k18	22	85	177605	`` Who do you think pays the rent ? 
8166	br-k18	22	86	177614	You would n't have me throw the poor boy out on the street '' , Eileen said when I needled her about it . 
8167	br-k18	22	87	177638	I said sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention . 
8168	br-k18	22	88	177655	Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she did n't want_to hear . 
8169	br-k18	22	89	177671	Still I did n't think she was twotiming me with Precious right then . 
8170	br-k18	22	90	177685	To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get_out of my sight day or night . 
8171	br-k18	23	91	177703	Precious had me worried . 
8172	br-k18	23	92	177708	I could n't make_out what his racket was . 
8173	br-k18	23	93	177717	I 'd thought him a pimp or procurer but he did n't seem to be . 
8174	br-k18	23	94	177733	He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his self-effacing manner . 
8175	br-k18	23	95	177753	Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet . 
8176	br-k18	23	96	177763	Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work . 
8177	br-k18	24	97	177780	I never could find_out what his business was . 
8178	br-k18	24	98	177789	He always seemed to have money in his pocket . 
8179	br-k18	24	99	177799	The phone had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger . 
8180	br-k18	24	100	177815	Now_and_then he would disappear for several days . 
8181	br-k18	24	101	177823	`` Connections '' was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions . 
8182	br-k18	24	102	177842	`` Oh he 's just an international spy '' , Eileen would shout with her screechy laugh . 
8183	br-k18	25	103	177860	Poor_devil he can n't have been too happy either . 
8184	br-k18	25	104	177870	He got no relief from drink because , though sometimes Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening , he 'd leave it on the table untouched . 
8185	br-k18	26	105	177905	When I was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess . 
8186	br-k18	26	106	177918	Occasionally if I pushed him too far he 'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his . 
8187	br-k18	26	107	177950	`` Some_day '' , I told Eileen , `` that guy will kill us both '' . 
8188	br-k18	26	108	177967	She just would n't listen . 
8189	br-k18	27	109	177973	Getting drunk every_night was the only way I could handle the situation . 
8190	br-k18	27	110	177986	Eileen seemed to feel the same way . 
8191	br-k18	27	111	177994	We still had that much in_common . 
8192	br-k18	27	112	178001	The trouble was drinking cost money . 
8193	br-k18	27	113	178008	The way Eileen and I were hitting_it_up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening . 
8194	br-k18	27	114	178025	Eileen must have wheedled a_little out of Precious . 
8195	br-k18	27	115	178034	I raised some kale by hocking the good clothes I had left_over from my respectable uptown life , but when that was gone I did n't have a cent . 
8196	br-k18	27	116	178064	I do n't know what we would have done if Pat_O'Dwyer had n't come to town . 
8197	br-k18	28	117	178081	Pat_O'Dwyer looked_like a heavier Jim . 
8198	br-k18	28	118	178087	He had the same bullet_head of curly reddish hair but he did n't have Jim 's poker-faced humor or his brains or his charm . 
8199	br-k18	28	119	178112	He was a big thick beefy violent man . 
8200	br-k18	28	120	178121	Now Pat may have been a lecher and a plug-ugly , but he was a good churchgoing Catholic and he loved his little_sister . 
8201	br-k18	28	121	178145	Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them stick_together in_spite of politics and everything . 
8202	br-k18	29	122	178161	Pat took Eileen and me out to dinner at a swell steak_house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again . 
8203	br-k18	29	123	178191	`` Whom God hath joined '' etcetera . 
8204	br-k18	29	124	178199	The O'Dwyers were real religious people except for Kate . 
8205	br-k18	29	125	178209	Now it would be up_to me to keep the little girl out of mischief . 
8206	br-k18	29	126	178224	Pat had been worried as hell ever since she 'd lost her job on that fashion magazine . 
8207	br-k18	29	127	178242	It had gone big with the Hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of Art_and_Apparel . 
8208	br-k18	29	128	178262	How about me trying to help her get her job back ? 
8209	br-k18	30	129	178274	All evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion . 
8210	br-k18	30	130	178292	It just_about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly came_out with what she came_out with . 
8211	br-k18	30	131	178311	`` But brother I can n't take a job right now '' , she said with her eyes on her ice_cream , `` I'm going_to have a baby , Francis_Xavier 's baby , my own husband 's baby '' . 
8212	br-k18	31	132	178351	My first thought was how had it happened so soon , but I counted back on my fingers and sure_enough we 'd been living together six weeks . 
8213	br-k18	31	133	178379	Pat meanwhile was bubbling_over with sentiment . 
8214	br-k18	31	134	178386	Greatest thing that ever happened . 
8215	br-k18	31	135	178392	Now Eileen really would have_to settle_down to love honor and obey , and she 'd have_to quit drinking . 
8216	br-k18	31	136	178411	He 'd come East for the christening , by_God he would . 
8217	br-k18	31	137	178423	When we separated that evening Pat pushed a_hundred dollar_bill into Eileen 's hand to help towards a layette . 
8218	br-k18	32	138	178442	Before he left town Pat saw_to_it that I was fixed_up with a job . 
8219	br-k18	32	139	178456	Pat had contacts all_over the labor_movement . 
8220	br-k18	32	140	178463	A friend of Pat 's named Frank_Sposato had just muscled_into the Portwatchers_'_Union . 
8221	br-k18	33	141	178476	The portwatchers were retired longshoremen and small_time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted_as watchmen on the wharves . 
8222	br-k18	33	142	178495	Most of them were elderly men . 
8223	br-k18	33	143	178502	It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New_York . 
8224	br-k18	33	144	178520	They were n't as well paid as they should have been . 
8225	br-k18	33	145	178532	One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen . 
8226	br-k18	34	146	178550	Sposato needed a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act_as business_agent of the Redhook local . 
8227	br-k18	34	147	178570	There I was a retired wobbly and structural iron_worker who 'd never gouged a cent off a fellow_worker in my thirty years in the movement . 
8228	br-k18	34	148	178596	For once radicalism was a recommendation . 
8229	br-k18	35	149	178603	Sposato could n't wait to get me hired . 
8230	br-k18	35	150	178612	With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff . 
8231	br-k18	35	151	178628	The things a man will do for a woman . 
8232	br-k19	1	1	178638	There was one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny . 
8233	br-k19	1	2	178656	As_long_as there were two human_beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no_more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave . 
8234	br-k19	1	3	178687	No_matter how devoted a man was , no_matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual . 
8235	br-k19	1	4	178722	All_of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord 's servants . 
8236	br-k19	1	5	178753	It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions . 
8237	br-k19	2	6	178772	Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church - his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career - but for the one clear victory he had talked_about to the colonel . 
8238	br-k19	2	7	178826	He was not sure how much of this desire was_due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were intertwined and could not be separated . 
8239	br-k19	2	8	178866	He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted_out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too . 
8240	br-k19	2	9	178901	But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan , that man 's ambition when linked with God would be a driving , indefatigable force for good in the world . 
8241	br-k19	3	10	178933	He sighed . 
8242	br-k19	3	11	178936	How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice . 
8243	br-k19	3	12	178955	He would have_to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought_about , would be sweet indeed . 
8244	br-k19	4	13	178988	His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a_few days . 
8245	br-k19	4	14	179003	His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print_shop , using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse . 
8246	br-k19	4	15	179051	In_any_event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked , telling him to keep_his_ears_open while he was in the village to see if he could find_out what Kayabashi was planning . 
8247	br-k19	5	16	179085	Hino was elated at the prospect . 
8248	br-k19	5	17	179092	He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go_to the pachinko parlor - an excellent place to make contact with the enemy . 
8249	br-k19	5	18	179128	He left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday , nodding attentively as Rector gave him his final instructions . 
8250	br-k19	5	19	179153	He was to get involved in no arguments ; he was to try to make no converts ; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard . 
8251	br-k19	6	20	179183	It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it , for Hino , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage_agent . 
8252	br-k19	6	21	179208	If he wanted to know anything , he would end_up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection . 
8253	br-k19	6	22	179245	In all of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino . 
8254	br-k19	6	23	179264	From the moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job , any job - his qualifications neatly written on a piece_of_paper in a precise hand - he had been ready to become a Christian . 
8255	br-k19	6	24	179305	He had already been studying the Bible ; he knew the fundamentals , and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector , announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that . 
8256	br-k19	7	25	179342	Rector had never been able to find_out much about Hino 's past . 
8257	br-k19	7	26	179355	Hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject . 
8258	br-k19	7	27	179378	Putting the pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague outlines of a biography . 
8259	br-k19	7	28	179395	Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in Chiba , and divided his life between the land and the sea , supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing_boat . 
8260	br-k19	7	29	179440	Without exception Hino 's brothers turned_to either one or both of their father 's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller . 
8261	br-k19	7	30	179485	He had gone_into the Japanese navy , had been trained as an officer , had participated in one or two battles - he never went into detail regarding his military experience - and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out_of_the_blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian . 
8262	br-k19	7	31	179547	Rector was often curious ; often tempted to ask questions but he never did . 
8263	br-k19	7	32	179562	If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so unasked . 
8264	br-k19	8	33	179580	Rector had no doubt that Hino would come_back from the village bursting with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellished with his active imagnation . 
8265	br-k19	8	34	179611	When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return , for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector 's office rarely rang unless it was important . 
8266	br-k19	8	35	179669	He was surprised to find Kayabashi 's secretary on the other end of the line . 
8267	br-k19	8	36	179685	He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted . 
8268	br-k19	8	37	179697	The oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries , the secretary said , businessmen from Tokyo for_the_most_part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission . 
8269	br-k19	8	38	179724	They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it . 
8270	br-k19	9	39	179738	`` Oh '' ? 
8271	br-k19	9	40	179742	Rector said . 
8272	br-k19	9	41	179745	`` I guess it will be all_right . 
8273	br-k19	9	42	179753	When would the oyabun like to bring his guests up_here '' ? 
8274	br-k19	10	43	179765	`` This afternoon '' , the secretary said . 
8275	br-k19	10	44	179774	`` At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time '' . 
8276	br-k19	11	45	179791	`` All_right '' , Rector said . 
8277	br-k19	11	46	179798	`` I will be expecting them '' . 
8278	br-k19	12	47	179806	He was about_to hang_up the phone , but a note of hesitancy in the secretary 's voice left the conversation open . 
8279	br-k19	12	48	179828	He had something more to say . 
8280	br-k19	12	49	179835	`` I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers '' , he said . 
8281	br-k19	13	50	179853	Rector laughed despite himself . 
8282	br-k19	13	51	179858	`` Unless the oyabun has been working_on it '' , he said , then checked himself and added : `` You can tell Kayabashi-san that the back road is in very good_condition and will be quite safe for his party to use '' . 
8283	br-k19	14	52	179902	`` Arigato gosaimasu '' . 
8284	br-k19	14	53	179907	The secretary sighed with relief and_then the telephone clicked in Rector 's hand . 
8285	br-k19	15	54	179921	Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission . 
8286	br-k19	15	55	179933	For the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it was probably the latter . 
8287	br-k19	15	56	179968	Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in_order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village . 
8288	br-k19	15	57	179999	At_the_same_time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out_of mere curiosity . 
8289	br-k19	15	58	180019	No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived . 
8290	br-k19	16	59	180044	When he had given the call a_few moments thought , he went_into the kitchen to ask Mrs._Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea_service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds . 
8291	br-k19	16	60	180096	Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn . 
8292	br-k19	16	61	180109	Rector asked him to move it for_the_time_being ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless . 
8293	br-k19	16	62	180127	A good initial impression would be important now . 
8294	br-k19	16	63	180136	He went_into the print_shop , where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press . 
8295	br-k19	17	64	180150	`` How many pamphlets do we have in_stock '' ? 
8296	br-k19	17	65	180160	Rector said . 
8297	br-k19	18	66	180163	`` I should say about a_hundred_thousand '' , Fletcher said . 
8298	br-k19	18	67	180174	`` Why '' ? 
8299	br-k19	19	68	180178	`` I would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon '' , Rector said , He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create , the picture of a very busy mission . 
8300	br-k19	19	69	180215	He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly , just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner . 
8301	br-k19	19	70	180237	Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector requested . 
8302	br-k19	20	71	180255	Rector 's next stop was at the schoolroom , where Mavis was monitoring a test . 
8303	br-k19	20	72	180271	He beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside . 
8304	br-k19	20	73	180284	He told her of the visitors and_then of his plans . 
8305	br-k19	20	74	180295	`` How many children do you have present today '' ? he said . 
8306	br-k19	21	75	180309	She looked_back toward the schoolroom . 
8307	br-k19	21	76	180315	`` Fifteen '' , she said . 
8308	br-k19	21	77	180322	`` No , only fourteen . 
8309	br-k19	21	78	180328	The little Ito girl had_to go_home . 
8310	br-k19	21	79	180335	She has a pretty bad cold '' . 
8311	br-k19	22	80	180343	`` I would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but joyous , exuberant , full_of_life . 
8312	br-k19	22	81	180365	I want to create the impression of a compound full of children . 
8313	br-k19	22	82	180378	Do you think you can manage it '' ? 
8314	br-k19	23	83	180387	Mavis smiled . 
8315	br-k19	23	84	180390	`` I 'll try '' . 
8316	br-k19	24	85	180396	As Rector was walking back toward the residential hall , Johnson came_out of the basement and bounded up_to him . 
8317	br-k19	24	86	180416	The altercation in the coffee_house had done little to dampen his spirits , but he was still a_little wary around Rector for they had not_yet discussed the incident . 
8318	br-k19	24	87	180445	`` I think I 've fixed the pump so we won't have_to worry about it for a long_time '' , he said . 
8319	br-k19	24	88	180468	`` I 've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts_out before the water gets too low '' . 
8320	br-k19	25	89	180487	`` Fine '' , Rector said . 
8321	br-k19	25	90	180494	He looked out over the expanse of the compound . 
8322	br-k19	25	91	180504	It was going_to take a_lot of activity to fill it . 
8323	br-k19	25	92	180515	`` Have you ever operated a transit '' ? he said . 
8324	br-k19	26	93	180527	`` No , sir '' , Johnson said . 
8325	br-k19	27	94	180536	`` You are about_to become a first-class surveyor '' , Rector said . 
8326	br-k19	27	95	180549	`` When Konishi gets_back with the jeep , I want you to round_up two or three Japanese boys . 
8327	br-k19	27	96	180568	Konishi can help you . 
8328	br-k19	27	97	180573	You 'll find an old transit in the basement . 
8329	br-k19	27	98	180583	The glass is out_of it , but that won't matter . 
8330	br-k19	27	99	180594	It looks pretty efficient and that 's the important thing '' . 
8331	br-k19	27	100	180606	He went_on to explain what he had_in_mind . 
8332	br-k19	27	101	180614	Johnson nodded . 
8333	br-k19	27	102	180617	He said he could do it . 
8334	br-k19	28	103	180624	Rector was warming_to his over-all strategy by the time he got_back to the residential hall . 
8335	br-k19	28	104	180640	It was rather a childish game , all_in_all , but everybody seemed to be getting_into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much . 
8336	br-k19	28	105	180675	He was not sure what effect it would have , but that was really beside the point when you got right down to_it . 
8337	br-k19	28	106	180699	He was not going_to lose the mission by default , and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission , he was going_to be in_for a surprise . 
8338	br-k19	29	107	180732	He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in_order in the residential hall , and_then to take_charge of the office while the party was here . 
8339	br-k19	29	108	180764	When everything had been done , Rector went_back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock . 
8340	br-k19	30	109	180786	At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep_an_eye_on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi 's party . 
8341	br-k19	30	110	180825	Then Rector , attired in his best blue serge suit , sat in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoking a cigarette and waiting . 
8342	br-k19	30	111	180858	The air was cooler here , and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant . 
8343	br-k20	1	1	180886	She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient . 
8344	br-k20	2	2	180901	The fish took the bait . 
8345	br-k20	2	3	180907	He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but - joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned . 
8346	br-k20	3	4	180942	But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement . 
8347	br-k20	3	5	180964	She was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed . 
8348	br-k20	3	6	180995	Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose . 
8349	br-k20	3	7	181010	She wrote again and now , abandoning for_the_moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career . 
8350	br-k20	3	8	181034	She could act and she could write . 
8351	br-k20	3	9	181042	His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury_Lane but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and criticize her novel ? 
8352	br-k20	4	10	181068	At_last he consented to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal : 
8353	br-k20	5	11	181089	Have you any objection to the following plan ? 
8354	br-k20	5	12	181098	On Thursday evening we may go_out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles . 
8355	br-k20	5	13	181121	There we shall be free and unknown ; we can return the following morning . 
8356	br-k20	6	14	181136	She concluded by asking for a brief interview - `` to settle with you where '' - and she threw_in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance '' . 
8357	br-k20	7	15	181174	She opened his reply with trembling fingers . 
8358	br-k20	7	16	181182	He agreed ! 
8359	br-k20	7	17	181185	And he would see her that evening . 
8360	br-k20	7	18	181193	Victory at_last ! 
8361	br-k20	8	19	181196	At their meeting he told her not to bother about `` where '' - he would attend to that . 
8362	br-k20	8	20	181216	There was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and , as Claire rose to go , he asked her to sing him one song before she left . 
8363	br-k20	8	21	181246	She sang him Scott 's charming ballad `` Rosabelle '' , which was the vogue of the moment . 
8364	br-k20	8	22	181265	She had never sung better . 
8365	br-k20	9	23	181271	`` Your voice is delightful '' , he approved with a warm smile . 
8366	br-k20	9	24	181285	`` Tomorrow will be a new experience - I have never before made_love to a nightingale . 
8367	br-k20	9	25	181302	There have been cooing doves , chattering magpies , thieving jackdaws , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy_eagle - whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals '' . 
8368	br-k20	10	26	181345	And so they went , he choosing of all places an inn near Medmenham_Abbey , scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the Hellfire_Club . 
8369	br-k20	10	27	181372	He regaled Claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the cassocked bloods , which he had had at firsthand from old Bud_Dodington , one of the leaders of the so-called `` Order '' . 
8370	br-k20	10	28	181409	Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for self-flagellation . 
8371	br-k20	10	29	181429	Naked girls danced in the chancel of the Abbey , the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities . 
8372	br-k20	11	30	181457	The jaded amorist conjured_up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish . 
8373	br-k20	11	31	181469	Alas , all that belonged_to the age of `` Devil_Dashwood '' and `` Wicked_Wilkes '' , abbot and beadsman of the Order ! 
8374	br-k20	11	32	181492	The casual seduction of a seventeen year old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison . 
8375	br-k20	12	33	181506	They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate . 
8376	br-k20	12	34	181515	A scant half_mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace , the air about them scented with stock , and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime_tree at the foot of the garden . 
8377	br-k20	12	35	181557	Charming and peaceful - but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure ? 
8378	br-k20	12	36	181572	Alone with the fabulous Byron ! 
8379	br-k20	12	37	181578	How many women had longed for the privilege that was hers . 
8380	br-k20	13	38	181590	How was she to behave , Claire wondered . 
8381	br-k20	13	39	181599	To be passive , to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd . 
8382	br-k20	13	40	181611	She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare 's poem . 
8383	br-k20	13	41	181625	And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience , satiety might well be an equal handicap . 
8384	br-k20	13	42	181643	No , she would not pretend modesty , but neither must she be crudely bold . 
8385	br-k20	13	43	181659	Mystery - that was the thing . 
8386	br-k20	13	44	181666	In the bedroom she would insist on darkness . 
8387	br-k20	13	45	181675	With his club_foot he might well be grateful . 
8388	br-k20	14	46	181684	At the inn , which was situated close to a broad weir , Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference and addressed as `` milord '' . 
8389	br-k20	14	47	181713	The place was evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown . 
8390	br-k20	15	48	181740	The fire in the sitting_room was lighted . 
8391	br-k20	16	49	181748	`` What about the bedroom '' ? 
8392	br-k20	16	50	181755	Byron inquired . 
8393	br-k20	16	51	181758	`` Seems to me last time I was here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell '' . 
8394	br-k20	17	52	181783	`` We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney , milord , but I promise you you 'll never have trouble of that sort again '' . 
8395	br-k20	18	53	181813	So , not_only had he been here before , but it seemed he might well come again . 
8396	br-k20	18	54	181831	Claire felt suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don_Juan . 
8397	br-k20	19	55	181850	A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port . 
8398	br-k20	19	56	181861	When Napoleon 's ship had borne him to Elba , French wines had started to cross the Channel , the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years , but the supplies had not_yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled . 
8399	br-k20	20	57	181908	As they waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in_hand , while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers . 
8400	br-k20	21	58	181934	`` Sex is overpriced '' , he said . 
8401	br-k20	21	59	181943	`` The great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against Fate , not man against man for the prize of a woman 's body . 
8402	br-k20	21	60	181968	So do n't see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance '' . 
8403	br-k20	22	61	181989	`` The gods seemed to think sex pretty important '' , she rebutted . 
8404	br-k20	22	62	182003	`` Mars and Venus , Bacchus and Ariadne , Jupiter and Io , Byron and the nymph of the owl 's nest . 
8405	br-k20	22	63	182026	That would be Minerva , I suppose . 
8406	br-k20	22	64	182034	Was n't the owl her symbol '' ? 
8407	br-k20	23	65	182042	Byron laughed . 
8408	br-k20	23	66	182045	`` So you know something of the classics , do you '' ? 
8409	br-k20	24	67	182058	`` Tell me about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you '' . 
8410	br-k20	25	68	182076	`` I 'll tell you nothing . 
8411	br-k20	25	69	182083	I do n't ask you who ' tis you 're being unfaithful to , husband or lover . 
8412	br-k20	25	70	182101	Frankly , I do n't care '' . 
8413	br-k20	26	71	182109	For a moment she thought_of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied_away_from virginity , who demanded some degree of education in body as_well_as mind . 
8414	br-k20	27	72	182139	`` Very_well '' , she said , `` I 'll not catechize you . 
8415	br-k20	27	73	182153	What matter the others so_long_as I have my place in history '' . 
8416	br-k20	28	74	182166	She was striking_the_right_note . 
8417	br-k20	28	75	182170	No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favored , flattery could hardly seem overdone . 
8418	br-k20	28	76	182193	Brains and beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual worlds , athlete , fabled lover - if ever the_world_was_any_man's_oyster it was his . 
8419	br-k20	29	77	182219	The light supper over , Claire went to him and , slipping an arm about his shoulder , sat on his knee . 
8420	br-k20	29	78	182242	He drew her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his . 
8421	br-k20	29	79	182258	Her lips , moist and parted , spoke his name . 
8422	br-k20	30	80	182269	`` Byron '' ! 
8423	br-k20	31	81	182273	His hand went to her shoulder and pushed_aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown ; then , to better purpose , he took_hold_of the knot and with dextrous fingers , untied it . 
8424	br-k20	31	82	182309	The bodice beneath was buttoned and , withdrawing his lips from hers , he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it , unhurriedly as if she were a child . 
8425	br-k20	32	83	182343	But , kindled by his kiss , his caressing hand , her desire was aflame . 
8426	br-k20	32	84	182359	She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom . 
8427	br-k20	32	85	182369	Lord_Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle_flame admiring the rich color . 
8428	br-k20	32	86	182388	He drank slowly with due appreciation . 
8429	br-k20	32	87	182395	It was an excellent vintage . 
8430	br-k20	33	88	182401	He rose and went to the bedroom . 
8431	br-k20	33	89	182409	Pausing in the doorway he said : `` The form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , is the most challenging loveliness in all nature '' . 
8432	br-k20	34	90	182441	When Claire returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron 's mistress . 
8433	br-k20	34	91	182458	By odd coincidence , on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read Parisina , which was the latest of the titled poet 's successes . 
8434	br-k20	34	92	182485	As he declaimed the sonorous measures , it was as_much_as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting_out with her dramatic tidings . 
8435	br-k20	35	93	182508	`` Although it is not the best of which he is capable '' , said Shelley as he closed the book , `` it is still poetry of a high order '' . 
8436	br-k20	36	94	182541	`` If he would only leave the East '' , said Mary . 
8437	br-k20	36	95	182554	`` I am tired_of sultans and scimitars '' . 
8438	br-k20	37	96	182563	`` The hero of his next poem is Napoleon_Bonaparte '' , said Claire , with slightly overdone carelessness . 
8439	br-k20	38	97	182582	`` How do you know that '' ? demanded Mary . 
8440	br-k20	39	98	182593	`` I was told it on_good_authority '' , Claire answered darkly . 
8441	br-k20	39	99	182605	`` I must n't tell , I must n't tell '' , she repeated to herself . 
8442	br-k20	39	100	182622	`` I promised him I would n't '' . 
8443	br-k20	40	101	182631	Winter came , and with it Mary 's baby - a boy as she had wished . 
8444	br-k20	40	102	182648	William , he was called , in honor of the man who was at_once Shelley 's pensioner and his most bitter detractor . 
8445	br-k20	40	103	182671	With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter : 
8446	br-k20	41	104	182687	`` Fanny and Mrs._Godwin will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement , and that her child is well '' . 
8447	br-k20	42	105	182716	At_the_same_time another child - this one of Shelley 's brain - was given to the world : Alastor , a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind 's musings . 
8448	br-k20	42	106	182757	Alastor was published only to be savagely attacked , contemptuously ignored . 
8449	br-k20	42	107	182769	Shelley sent a copy to Southey , a former friend , and another to Godwin . 
8450	br-k20	42	108	182785	Neither acknowledged the gift . 
8451	br-k20	43	109	182790	Only Mary 's praise sustained him in his disappointment . 
8452	br-k20	43	110	182800	She understood completely . 
8453	br-k20	43	111	182804	Not a thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation . 
8454	br-k20	44	112	182818	`` You have made the labor worth_while '' , he said to her , smiling . 
8455	br-k20	44	113	182834	`` And in the future , since I write for a public of one , I can save the poor publishers from wasting their money '' . 
8456	br-k20	45	114	182861	`` A public of one '' , Mary echoed reprovingly . 
8457	br-k20	45	115	182872	`` how can you say such a thing ? 
8458	br-k20	45	116	182881	There will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor . 
8459	br-k20	45	117	182894	There are some even now . 
8460	br-k20	45	118	182900	What about that dear , clever Mr._Thynne ? 
8461	br-k20	45	119	182908	I am sure he is in raptures '' . 
8462	br-k20	46	120	182917	`` Poor Mr._Thynne , he always has to be trotted_out for my encouragement '' . 
8463	br-k20	47	121	182932	`` There are other Mr._Thynnes . 
8464	br-k20	47	122	182938	Not everyone is bewitched by Byron 's caliphs and harem beauties '' . 
8465	br-k20	48	123	182951	Mary 's super critical attitude toward Byron had nothing to_do_with his moral disrepute . 
8466	br-k20	48	124	182965	She was resentful of his easy success as compared with Shelley 's failure . 
8467	br-k20	48	125	182979	The same month that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The_Siege_of_Corinth , a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley 's generosity rebelled at . 
8468	br-k20	49	126	183008	The lordly poet was at low-water_mark . 
8469	br-k20	49	127	183015	The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent . 
8470	br-k20	49	128	183028	On all sides doors were being slammed in his face . 
8471	br-k20	49	129	183039	The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity . 
8472	br-k20	49	130	183057	Now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be . 
8473	br-k20	49	131	183093	He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half_sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted_in would involve them in a common ruin . 
8474	br-k20	49	132	183127	For_the_moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity . 
8475	br-k20	50	133	183148	But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing . 
8476	br-k20	50	134	183163	Byron , since the separation from his wife had been living in a smallish house in Piccadilly_Terrace . 
8477	br-k20	50	135	183181	He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor , claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes . 
8478	br-k21	1	1	183207	Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel . 
8479	br-k21	1	2	183215	He had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order , but the slip_of_paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel 's belt . 
8480	br-k21	1	3	183252	Despite his yearning , the colonel would not go_down to see the men come_through the lines . 
8481	br-k21	1	4	183269	He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task . 
8482	br-k21	2	5	183285	- Beckworth . 
8483	br-k21	3	6	183288	- Sir ? 
8484	br-k21	4	7	183291	- Fetch me the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months . 
8485	br-k21	5	8	183310	- The last six months , sir ? 
8486	br-k21	6	9	183318	- You heard me . 
8487	br-k21	6	10	183323	There 's a_lot of waste going_on here . 
8488	br-k21	6	11	183331	It 's got_to stop . 
8489	br-k21	6	12	183336	I want to take_a_look . 
8490	br-k21	6	13	183341	This is no damned holiday , Beckworth . 
8491	br-k21	6	14	183349	Get busy . 
8492	br-k21	7	15	183352	- Yes , sir . 
8493	br-k21	8	16	183357	Beckworth left the tent . 
8494	br-k21	8	17	183362	Below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank . 
8495	br-k21	8	18	183373	He glanced back . 
8496	br-k21	8	19	183377	The colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding_chairs , methodically tearing at his thumbnail . 
8497	br-k21	9	20	183393	The bombproof was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth . 
8498	br-k21	9	21	183406	It stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank . 
8499	br-k21	9	22	183418	From the outside , it seemed no more than a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth . 
8500	br-k21	9	23	183438	A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor . 
8501	br-k21	9	24	183448	Two slits enabled observers to watch across the river . 
8502	br-k21	9	25	183458	The place smelled strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine . 
8503	br-k21	9	26	183473	The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson 's boots . 
8504	br-k21	9	27	183483	At_least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle . 
8505	br-k21	9	28	183496	There was no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back , stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams . 
8506	br-k21	9	29	183529	In the corner was the soldier with the white_flag . 
8507	br-k21	9	30	183539	He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth . 
8508	br-k21	9	31	183557	Watson hardly looked at him . 
8509	br-k21	9	32	183563	The man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant , brandishing the flag_of_truce . 
8510	br-k21	9	33	183581	Someone had hauled him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed . 
8511	br-k21	10	34	183598	An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank . 
8512	br-k21	10	35	183612	The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy . 
8513	br-k21	10	36	183635	When the boat had touched , the weaker ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried_away by the soldiers . 
8514	br-k21	10	37	183659	Watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof . 
8515	br-k21	10	38	183671	The officer had told him that both lists must be checked . 
8516	br-k21	10	39	183683	Watson had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass . 
8517	br-k21	10	40	183695	The officer , surprised , said he would have to see . 
8518	br-k21	10	41	183707	Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later . 
8519	br-k21	10	42	183722	He had peered through the darkness at the rampart . 
8520	br-k21	10	43	183732	The men he would take_back across the river stood there , but he turned_away from them . 
8521	br-k21	10	44	183749	He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt . 
8522	br-k21	10	45	183772	He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him . 
8523	br-k21	10	46	183789	Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence . 
8524	br-k21	10	47	183803	Perhaps it would be better to speak_to him , since silence could not exorcise his form . 
8525	br-k21	10	48	183820	Watson glanced briefly at him , seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner . 
8526	br-k21	11	49	183837	- We won't be too long . 
8527	br-k21	11	50	183844	If my pass is approved , I may be a half_hour . 
8528	br-k21	12	51	183856	The soldier answered in a curious , muffled voice , his lips barely moving . 
8529	br-k21	12	52	183871	Watson turned_away and did not see the man 's knees buckle and his body sag . 
8530	br-k21	13	53	183887	- Yes , sir . 
8531	br-k21	14	54	183892	He had acknowledged the man . 
8532	br-k21	14	55	183898	It was easier to think now , Watson decided . 
8533	br-k21	14	56	183908	The stiff figure in the corner no_longer blocked his thoughts . 
8534	br-k21	14	57	183919	He paced slowly , stooping , staring at the damp , slippery floor . 
8535	br-k21	14	58	183933	He tried to order the words of the three Union officers , seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy . 
8536	br-k21	14	59	183956	But he groped blindly . 
8537	br-k21	14	60	183961	His lack of success steadily eroded his interest . 
8538	br-k21	14	61	183970	He stopped pacing , leaned_against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift . 
8539	br-k21	14	62	183986	A feeling of futility , an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known , seeped through him . 
8540	br-k21	14	63	184008	What in_the_name_of_God was he doing , crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river ? 
8541	br-k21	14	64	184027	Why had he crossed the dark water , to bring_back a group of reclaimed soldiers or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole ? 
8542	br-k21	15	65	184050	He grew annoyed and at_the_same_time surprised at that emotion . 
8543	br-k21	15	66	184060	He was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity . 
8544	br-k21	15	67	184070	Hillman had written it all out , had n't he ? 
8545	br-k21	15	68	184081	Was n't the report official enough ? 
8546	br-k21	15	69	184088	What did he hope to accomplish here ? 
8547	br-k21	15	70	184096	Hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank . 
8548	br-k21	15	71	184107	Prompted by a guilty urge , he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected . 
8549	br-k21	15	72	184124	For what ? 
8550	br-k21	15	73	184127	To tell John something he would find_out for himself . 
8551	br-k21	16	74	184137	The figure in the corner belched loudly , a deep , liquid eruption . 
8552	br-k21	16	75	184151	Watson snorted and_then laughed aloud . 
8553	br-k21	16	76	184157	Exactly ! 
8554	br-k21	17	77	184159	The soldier 's voice was muffled again , stricken with chagrin . 
8555	br-k21	17	78	184171	He clutched the staff , and his dark eyes blinked apologetically . 
8556	br-k21	18	79	184183	- ' Scuse me , sir . 
8557	br-k21	19	80	184190	- Let 's get_out of here . 
8558	br-k21	20	81	184197	Watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking_in the cool air that smelled of mud and river weeds . 
8559	br-k21	20	82	184219	To his left , the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank . 
8560	br-k21	20	83	184235	The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current . 
8561	br-k21	20	84	184247	A soldier held the end of a frayed rope . 
8562	br-k21	21	85	184257	Three Union guards appeared , carrying their rifles at ready . 
8563	br-k21	21	86	184268	Watson stared at them curiously . 
8564	br-k21	21	87	184274	They were stocky men , well_fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniforms and sturdy boots . 
8565	br-k21	21	88	184290	Behind them shambled a long column of weak , tattered men . 
8566	br-k21	21	89	184302	The thin gray figures raised a hoarse , cawing cry like the call of a bird flock . 
8567	br-k21	21	90	184320	They moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness , elbowing and shoving . 
8568	br-k21	21	91	184333	Four men were knocked_down , but did not attempt to rise . 
8569	br-k21	21	92	184345	They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats . 
8570	br-k21	21	93	184356	The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy , indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs . 
8571	br-k21	21	94	184377	The crawling men tried to rise and fell again . 
8572	br-k21	21	95	184387	No_one moved to them . 
8573	br-k21	21	96	184392	Watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly . 
8574	br-k21	21	97	184410	In a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff . 
8575	br-k21	21	98	184434	The third crawling man forced himself erect . 
8576	br-k21	21	99	184442	He swayed like a drunkard , his arms milling in slow circles . 
8577	br-k21	21	100	184455	He paced forward unsteadily , leaning too far back , his head tilted oddly . 
8578	br-k21	21	101	184470	His steps were short and stiff , and , with his head thrown_back , his progress was a supercilious strut . 
8579	br-k21	21	102	184491	He appeared to be peering haughtily down_his_nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom . 
8580	br-k21	21	103	184511	He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge , his weight nearly swamping the craft . 
8581	br-k21	21	104	184534	Watson looked_for the fourth man . 
8582	br-k21	21	105	184540	He had reached the three passive guards ; he crept in an incertain manner , patting the ground before him . 
8583	br-k21	21	106	184561	The guards did not look at him . 
8584	br-k21	21	107	184569	The figure on the earth halted , seemingly bewildered . 
8585	br-k21	21	108	184579	He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound . 
8586	br-k21	21	109	184591	Then he began to crawl again . 
8587	br-k21	21	110	184598	Watson watched the creeping figure . 
8588	br-k21	21	111	184604	He felt a spectator interest . 
8589	br-k21	21	112	184610	Would the man make_it or not ? 
8590	br-k21	21	113	184617	If only there was a clock for him to crawl against . 
8591	br-k21	21	114	184629	If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes , say , then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud . 
8592	br-k21	21	115	184656	Say three minutes to make it sporting . 
8593	br-k21	21	116	184664	Still the guards did not move , but stood inert , aloof from the slow scrambling man . 
8594	br-k21	21	117	184682	The figure halted , and Watson gasped . 
8595	br-k21	21	118	184690	The man began to creep in the wrong direction , deceived by a slight rise in the ground ! 
8596	br-k21	21	119	184709	He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart . 
8597	br-k21	21	120	184724	Watson raced for him , his boots slamming the soft earth . 
8598	br-k21	22	121	184736	The guards came_to_life with astonishing menace . 
8599	br-k21	22	122	184743	They spun and flung their rifles up . 
8600	br-k21	22	123	184751	Watson gesticulated wildly . 
8601	br-k21	22	124	184755	One man dropped to his knee for better aim . 
8602	br-k21	23	125	184765	- Let me help him , for_the_love_of_God ! 
8603	br-k21	24	126	184773	The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen , puzzled faces . 
8604	br-k21	24	127	184791	Watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily . 
8605	br-k21	24	128	184803	He reached down and closed his fingers on the man 's upper arm . 
8606	br-k21	24	129	184817	Beneath his clutch , a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone . 
8607	br-k21	24	130	184831	Watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet . 
8608	br-k21	24	131	184842	Watson stared into a cadaverous face . 
8609	br-k21	24	132	184849	Two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids . 
8610	br-k21	24	133	184861	Light sticks of fingers , the tips gummy with dark earth , patted at Watson 's throat . 
8611	br-k21	24	134	184879	The man 's voice was a sweet , patient whisper . 
8612	br-k21	25	135	184890	- Henry said that he 'd take my arm and get me right there . 
8613	br-k21	25	136	184905	But you ai_n't Henry . 
8614	br-k21	26	137	184910	- No . 
8615	br-k21	27	138	184913	- It do n't matter . 
8616	br-k21	27	139	184919	Is it far ? 
8617	br-k21	28	140	184923	How far could it be , Watson thought bleakly , how far can a blind_man crawl ? 
8618	br-k21	28	141	184940	Another body_length or all the rest of his nighted life ? 
8619	br-k21	29	142	184951	- Not far . 
8620	br-k21	30	143	184955	- You talk deep . 
8621	br-k21	30	144	184960	Not like us fellas . 
8622	br-k21	30	145	184965	It raises the voice , bein in camp . 
8623	br-k21	30	146	184974	You Secesh ? 
8624	br-k21	31	147	184977	- Yes . 
8625	br-k21	31	148	184980	Come_on , now . 
8626	br-k21	31	149	184984	Can you walk ? 
8627	br-k21	32	150	184988	- Why , course I can . 
8628	br-k21	32	151	184995	I can walk real good . 
8629	br-k21	33	152	185001	Watson stumbled down the bank . 
8630	br-k21	33	153	185007	The man leaned his frail body against Watson 's shoulder . 
8631	br-k21	33	154	185018	He was no heavier than a child . 
8632	br-k21	33	155	185026	Watson paused for breath . 
8633	br-k21	33	156	185031	The man wheezed weakly , his fetid breath beating softly against Watson 's neck . 
8634	br-k21	33	157	185046	His sweet whisper came after great effort . 
8635	br-k21	34	158	185054	- Oh , Christ . 
8636	br-k21	34	159	185059	I wish you was Henry . 
8637	br-k21	34	160	185065	He promised to take me . 
8638	br-k21	35	161	185071	- Hush . 
8639	br-k21	35	162	185074	We 're almost there . 
8640	br-k21	36	163	185079	Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff . 
8641	br-k21	36	164	185102	The man swayed on a thwart , turning his ruined eyes from side to side . 
8642	br-k21	36	165	185118	Watson turned_away , sickened for_the_first_time in many months . 
8643	br-k21	36	166	185127	He heard the patient voice calling . 
8644	br-k21	37	167	185134	- Henry ? 
8645	br-k21	37	168	185137	Where are you , Henry ? 
8646	br-k21	38	169	185143	- Make him lie_down ! 
8647	br-k21	39	170	185148	Watson snatched a deep breath . 
8648	br-k21	39	171	185154	He had not meant to shout . 
8649	br-k21	39	172	185161	He stood with his back to the skiff . 
8650	br-k21	39	173	185170	The men mewed and scratched , begging to be taken_away . 
8651	br-k21	39	174	185181	Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches . 
8652	br-k21	40	175	185193	- Goddamn you ! 
8653	br-k21	40	176	185197	What do you do to them ? 
8654	br-k21	41	177	185204	Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly . 
8655	br-k21	41	178	185210	He was angry , sickened . 
8656	br-k21	41	179	185216	He had not felt that during the afternoon . 
8657	br-k21	41	180	185225	No , nor later . 
8658	br-k21	41	181	185230	All his emotions had been inward , self-conscious . 
8659	br-k21	41	182	185239	In war , on a night like this , it was only the outward emotions that mattered , what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others . 
8660	br-k21	41	183	185269	Yes . 
8661	br-k21	41	184	185271	That was it . 
8662	br-k21	41	185	185275	He was sure of_it . 
8663	br-k21	42	186	185280	John 's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen . 
8664	br-k21	42	187	185293	What a fool he had been to think_of his brother ! 
8665	br-k21	42	188	185304	So Charles was dead . 
8666	br-k21	42	189	185309	What did it matter ? 
8667	br-k21	42	190	185314	His name had been crossed_off a list . 
8668	br-k21	42	191	185322	Already his cool body lay in the ground . 
8669	br-k21	42	192	185331	What words had any meaning ? 
8670	br-k21	42	193	185337	What had he thought_of , to go to John , grovel and beg understanding ? 
8671	br-k21	42	194	185352	To confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu , gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him rise and go ? 
8672	br-k21	42	195	185378	Men were slaughtered every_day , tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute . 
8673	br-k21	42	196	185397	What made him think John had a right to witness his brother 's humiliation ? 
8674	br-k21	42	197	185412	What right had John to any special consideration ? 
8675	br-k21	42	198	185421	Was John better , more deserving ? 
8676	br-k21	42	199	185428	To_hell_with John . 
8677	br-k21	42	200	185431	Let him chafe with_impatience to see Charles , rip open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in Hillman 's beautiful , schoolmaster 's hand . 
8678	br-k21	42	201	185460	John would curse . 
8679	br-k21	42	202	185464	He believed that brave boys did n't cry . 
8680	br-k21	43	203	185473	Watson spat on the ground . 
8681	br-k21	43	204	185479	He was grimly satisfied . 
8682	br-k21	43	205	185484	He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother 's pain . 
8683	br-k21	43	206	185497	Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering . 
8684	br-k22	1	1	185512	I would not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming , `` O Gogol , O Chekhov , O Thackeray and Dickens , what would you have made_of a bomb_shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks , a birdbath , and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps '' ? 
8685	br-k22	1	2	185569	As I say , I would n't want to begin a day like this , but I often wonder what the dead would have done . 
8686	br-k22	1	3	185595	But the shelter is as_much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge . 
8687	br-k22	1	4	185617	I can see it from this window where I write . 
8688	br-k22	1	5	185628	It was built by the Pasterns , and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property . 
8689	br-k22	1	6	185647	It bulks under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and I think Mrs._Pastern set_out the statuary to soften its meaning . 
8690	br-k22	1	7	185677	It would have been like her . 
8691	br-k22	1	8	185684	She was a pale woman . 
8692	br-k22	1	9	185690	Sitting on her terrace , sitting in her parlor , sitting anywhere , she ground_an_axe of self-esteem . 
8693	br-k22	1	10	185708	Offer her a cup of tea and she would say , `` Why , these cups look just like a set I gave to the Salvation_Army last year '' . 
8694	br-k22	1	11	185738	Show her the new swimming_pool and she would say , slapping her ankle , `` I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes '' . 
8695	br-k22	1	12	185766	Hand her a chair and she would say , `` Why , it 's a nice imitation of those Queen_Anne chairs I inherited from Grandmother_Delancy '' . 
8696	br-k22	1	13	185793	These trumps were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare . 
8697	br-k22	1	14	185824	Twenty years ago , she would have been known as a golf_widow , and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of bereavement . 
8698	br-k22	1	15	185849	She usually wore weeds , and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr._Pastern was dead , but Mr._Pastern was far from dead . 
8699	br-k22	1	16	185877	He was marching up_and_down the locker_room of the Grassy_Brae_Golf_Club shouting , `` Bomb Cuba ! 
8700	br-k22	1	17	185892	Bomb Berlin ! 
8701	br-k22	1	18	185895	Let 's throw a_little nuclear hardware at them and show them who 's boss '' . 
8702	br-k22	1	19	185911	He was brigadier of the club 's locker-room light infantry , and at one time or another declared war on Russia , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and China . 
8703	br-k22	2	20	185940	It all began on an autumn afternoon - and who , after all these centuries , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ? 
8704	br-k22	2	21	185965	One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it . 
8705	br-k22	2	22	185990	The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year 's lights . 
8706	br-k22	2	23	186010	Leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginnings . 
8707	br-k22	2	24	186028	The boundless blue_air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum . 
8708	br-k22	2	25	186043	Leaving her house one late afternoon , Mrs._Pastern stopped to admire the October light . 
8709	br-k22	2	26	186058	It was the day to canvass for infectious_hepatitis . 
8710	br-k22	2	27	186067	Mrs._Pastern had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipts . 
8711	br-k22	2	28	186086	It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks . 
8712	br-k22	2	29	186100	Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got_into her car she looked at the houses below . 
8713	br-k22	2	30	186122	Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity . 
8714	br-k22	2	31	186141	Mrs._Balcolm worked for the brain . 
8715	br-k22	2	32	186147	Mrs._Ten_Eyke did mental_health . 
8716	br-k22	2	33	186151	Mrs._Trenchard worked for the blind . 
8717	br-k22	2	34	186157	Mrs._Horowitz was in_charge_of diseases of the nose and throat . 
8718	br-k22	2	35	186167	Mrs._Trempler was tuberculosis , Mrs._Surcliffe was Mothers ' March_of_Dimes , Mrs._Craven was cancer , and Mrs._Gilkson did the kidney . 
8719	br-k22	2	36	186187	Mrs._Hewlitt led the birthcontrol league , Mrs._Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate_roof of Ethel_Littleton 's house , a roof that signified gout . 
8720	br-k22	3	37	186218	Mrs._Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer . 
8721	br-k22	3	38	186239	It was her destiny ; it was her life . 
8722	br-k22	3	39	186249	Her mother had done it before her , and even her old grandmother , who had collected money for smallpox and unwed mothers . 
8723	br-k22	3	40	186273	Mrs._Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in_advance , and most of them were ready for her . 
8724	br-k22	3	41	186291	She experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias . 
8725	br-k22	3	42	186304	Here_and_there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry . 
8726	br-k22	3	43	186316	The contributions were ahead_of what she had got the previous year , and while the money , of_course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks . 
8727	br-k22	3	44	186350	She stopped at the Surcliffes ' after dusk , and had a Scotch-and-soda . 
8728	br-k22	3	45	186364	She stayed too late , and when she left , it was dark and time to go_home and cook supper for her husband . 
8729	br-k22	3	46	186388	`` I got a_hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund '' , she said excitedly when he walked in . 
8730	br-k22	3	47	186409	`` I did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans . 
8731	br-k22	3	48	186423	I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning - would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner '' ? 
8732	br-k22	4	49	186445	`` But I do n't know the Flannagans '' , Charlie_Pastern said . 
8733	br-k22	5	50	186458	`` Nobody does , but they gave me ten last year '' . 
8734	br-k22	6	51	186471	He was tired , he had his business worries , and the sight of his wife arranging pork_chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day . 
8735	br-k22	6	52	186502	He was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the Blevins ' , thinking that they might give him a drink . 
8736	br-k22	6	53	186529	But the Blevins were away ; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door . 
8737	br-k22	6	54	186551	Turning_in at the Flannagans ' driveway , he tried to remember if he had ever met them . 
8738	br-k22	6	55	186569	The name encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the_Irish . 
8739	br-k22	6	56	186584	There was a glass pane in the front_door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers . 
8740	br-k22	7	57	186613	`` Infectious_hepatitis '' , he shouted heartily . 
8741	br-k22	8	58	186621	She took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and , walking with very small steps , started toward the door . 
8742	br-k22	8	59	186647	`` Oh , please come_in '' , she said . 
8743	br-k22	8	60	186657	The girlish voice was nearly a whisper . 
8744	br-k22	8	61	186665	She was not a girl , he could see . 
8745	br-k22	8	62	186675	Her hair was dyed , and her bloom was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who cling_to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight . 
8746	br-k22	8	63	186716	`` Your wife just called '' , she said , separating one word from another , exactly like a child . 
8747	br-k22	8	64	186737	`` And I am not sure that I have any cash - any money , that_is - but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook . 
8748	br-k22	8	65	186776	Wo n't you step into the living_room , where it 's cozier '' ? 
8749	br-k22	9	66	186790	A fire had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been set_out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts was instantaneous . 
8750	br-k22	9	67	186822	Where was Mr._Flannagan , he wondered . 
8751	br-k22	9	68	186829	Travelling home on a late train ? 
8752	br-k22	9	69	186836	Changing his clothes upstairs ? 
8753	br-k22	9	70	186841	Taking a shower ? 
8754	br-k22	9	71	186845	At the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers , and she began to riffle these , making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation . 
8755	br-k22	9	72	186875	`` I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting '' , she said , `` but won't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ? 
8756	br-k22	9	73	186902	Everything 's on the table '' . 
8757	br-k22	10	74	186909	`` What train does Mr._Flannagan come_out on '' ? 
8758	br-k22	11	75	186918	`` Mr._Flannagan is away '' , she said . 
8759	br-k22	11	76	186927	Her voice dropped . 
8760	br-k22	11	77	186931	`` Mr._Flannagan has been away for six weeks '' . 
8761	br-k22	12	78	186941	`` I 'll have a drink , then , if you 'll have one with me '' . 
8762	br-k22	13	79	186959	`` If you will promise to make it weak '' . 
8763	br-k22	14	80	186970	`` Sit_down '' , he said , `` and enjoy your drink and look_for your checkbook later . 
8764	br-k22	14	81	186988	The only way to find things is to relax '' . 
8765	br-k22	15	82	186999	All_in_all , they had six drinks . 
8766	br-k22	15	83	187006	She described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly . 
8767	br-k22	15	84	187014	Mr._Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue_depressors . 
8768	br-k22	15	85	187019	He travelled all_over the world . 
8769	br-k22	15	86	187025	She did n't like to travel . 
8770	br-k22	15	87	187032	Planes made her feel faint , and in Tokyo , where she had gone that summer , she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home . 
8771	br-k22	15	88	187065	She and her husband had formerly lived in New_York , where she had many friends , but Mr._Flannagan thought the country would be safer in_case_of war . 
8772	br-k22	15	89	187092	She would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom . 
8773	br-k22	15	90	187105	She had no children ; she had made no friends . 
8774	br-k22	15	91	187116	`` I 've seen you , though , before '' , she said with enormous coyness , patting his knee . 
8775	br-k22	15	92	187137	`` I 've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible '' . 
8776	br-k22	16	93	187155	The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her plumpness . 
8777	br-k22	16	94	187178	Sheer plumpness , he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions . 
8778	br-k22	16	95	187198	It serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass . 
8779	br-k22	16	96	187212	And knowing its humble place in the scale of things , why did he , at this time_of_life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness ? 
8780	br-k22	16	97	187241	The remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at_first that he did n't know what to make_of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look_for her checkbook there . 
8781	br-k22	17	98	187289	`` I 've never done this before '' , she said later , when he was arranging himself to leave . 
8782	br-k22	17	99	187310	Her voice shook with feeling , and he thought it lovely . 
8783	br-k22	17	100	187322	He did n't doubt her truthfulness , although he had heard the words a_hundred_times . 
8784	br-k22	17	101	187337	`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders . 
8785	br-k22	17	102	187359	`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor . 
8786	br-k22	17	103	187381	`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , pouring another whiskey . 
8787	br-k22	17	104	187398	`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , putting_on their stockings . 
8788	br-k22	17	105	187415	On ships at_sea , on railroad_trains , in summer hotels with mountain views , they always said , `` I 've never done this before '' . 
8789	br-k22	18	106	187442	`` Where have you been '' ? 
8790	br-k22	18	107	187449	Mrs._Pastern asked sadly , when he came_in . 
8791	br-k22	18	108	187457	`` It 's after eleven '' . 
8792	br-k22	19	109	187464	`` I had a drink with the Flannagans '' . 
8793	br-k22	20	110	187474	`` She told me he was in Germany '' . 
8794	br-k22	21	111	187484	`` He came home unexpectedly '' . 
8795	br-k22	22	112	187491	Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went_into the TV_room to hear the news . 
8796	br-k22	22	113	187507	`` Bomb them '' ! he shouted . 
8797	br-k22	22	114	187515	`` Throw a_little nuclear hardware at them ! 
8798	br-k22	22	115	187523	Show them who 's boss '' ! 
8799	br-k22	22	116	187530	But in bed he had trouble sleeping . 
8800	br-k22	22	117	187538	He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college . 
8801	br-k22	22	118	187551	He loved them . 
8802	br-k22	22	119	187555	It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known . 
8803	br-k22	22	120	187569	Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his opponents , and his weather in_detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries . 
8804	br-k22	22	121	187612	His money was tied_up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him . 
8805	br-k22	22	122	187640	His worries harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window . 
8806	br-k22	22	123	187660	In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves . 
8807	br-k22	22	124	187673	During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga . 
8808	br-k22	22	125	187715	Maple and ash , beech and elm , one_hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one_hundred to win on Two in the eighth . 
8809	br-k22	22	126	187750	Children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage . 
8810	br-k22	22	127	187765	Then , getting_back into bed , he thought unashamedly of Mrs._Flannagan , planning where they would next meet and what they would do . 
8811	br-k22	22	128	187789	There are , he thought , so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed , as it did , a_little crude ? 
8812	br-k23	1	1	187824	It was not as_though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years , not since their last journey eastward to witness their Uncle_Izaak being lowered into the rocky soil ; that aside from due notification of certain major events in their lives ( two marriages , two births , one divorce ) , Christmas and Easter_cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the widowed years . 
8813	br-k23	1	2	187906	Her thoughts were not discrete . 
8814	br-k23	1	3	187912	But there was a look about her mouth as_though she were tasting lemons . 
8815	br-k23	2	4	187926	She grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight . 
8816	br-k23	2	5	187945	She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty legged escritoire , warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea_spray . 
8817	br-k23	2	6	187972	There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote_off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark . 
8818	br-k23	3	7	187992	Once her trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips . 
8819	br-k23	3	8	188028	And the stiffly regal look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver of age which , thwarting the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken_words like a thin ragged string . 
8820	br-k23	3	9	188065	`` Please come_down as_soon_as you conveniently can '' , the upright letters stalked from the broad nibbed pen , `` I have an important matter to discuss with you '' . 
8821	br-k23	3	10	188096	To Abel : 
8822	br-k23	3	11	188099	`` I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here . 
8823	br-k23	3	12	188113	I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters . 
8824	br-k23	3	13	188127	You may stay as long as you wish , of_course , but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into_account , I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in '' . 
8825	br-k23	3	14	188168	To Mark : `` Please give my regards to Myra '' . 
8826	br-k23	4	15	188180	She signed the letters quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town . 
8827	br-k23	4	16	188203	Then she went_back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water . 
8828	br-k23	5	17	188222	`` My nephews will be coming_down '' , she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining_room , the whole meal on a vast linen covered tray . 
8829	br-k23	5	18	188253	She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had faded to a near absence of color which had , possibly from her constant looking_at the water , something of the light of the sea in them . 
8830	br-k23	6	19	188319	Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew_off the cloth . 
8831	br-k23	6	20	188337	She smiled , and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face . 
8832	br-k23	6	21	188351	`` That will be so nice for you , Mrs._Packard '' , she said . 
8833	br-k23	6	22	188366	Her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in Sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose . 
8834	br-k23	7	23	188393	`` Um '' , said the old lady , and brought her eyes down to the tray . 
8835	br-k23	7	24	188411	`` You remember them , I suppose '' ? 
8836	br-k23	7	25	188420	She glinted suspiciously at the dish before her : `` Blowfish . 
8837	br-k23	7	26	188432	I hope Raphael bought them whole '' . 
8838	br-k23	8	27	188440	Angelina stepped back , her eyes roaming the tray for omissions . 
8839	br-k23	8	28	188452	Then she looked at the old_woman again , her eyes calm . 
8840	br-k23	9	29	188464	`` Yes '' , she said , `` I remember that they came here every summer . 
8841	br-k23	9	30	188481	I used_to play with the older one sometimes , when he 'd let me . 
8842	br-k23	9	31	188496	Abel '' ? 
8843	br-k23	9	32	188499	The name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips . 
8844	br-k23	9	33	188510	For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile . 
8845	br-k23	9	34	188524	She would have said triumph . 
8846	br-k23	9	35	188530	Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen . 
8847	br-k23	10	36	188543	Jessica_Packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips . 
8848	br-k23	10	37	188569	For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; then she snorted and groped_for her fork . 
8849	br-k23	11	38	188589	There 's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green_beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling_away of a family . 
8850	br-k23	11	39	188617	Procreation , expansion , proliferation - these are the laws of living_things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments : oblivion . 
8851	br-k23	11	40	188644	When the fate of the individual is visited on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted . 
8852	br-k23	11	41	188689	And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth . 
8853	br-k23	12	42	188701	She was the last living of the older generation . 
8854	br-k23	12	43	188711	What had once been a widespread family - at one time , she knew , there were enough Packards to populate an entire county - had now narrowed_down to the two boys , Abel and Mark . 
8855	br-k23	12	44	188748	She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans . 
8856	br-k23	12	45	188768	What hope lay_in the nephews , she asked the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear_on the Packard name ? 
8857	br-k23	13	46	188808	She ate . 
8858	br-k23	13	47	188811	It seemed to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table 's empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows . 
8859	br-k23	13	48	188849	Here , too , she talked low , quirking her head at one or another of the places , most often at Izaak 's armchair which faced her across the long table . 
8860	br-k23	13	49	188882	Or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed , consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years . 
8861	br-k23	14	50	188910	She thought again of her children , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies . 
8862	br-k23	14	51	188943	The girl , her first , she barely remembered . 
8863	br-k23	14	52	188953	It could have been anyone 's infant , for it had not survived the bassinet . 
8864	br-k23	14	53	188969	But the boy , the boy had been alive yesterday . 
8865	br-k23	14	54	188980	Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her . 
8866	br-k23	14	55	188995	He ran on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now_and_again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held_on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire . 
8867	br-k23	14	56	189044	In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her . 
8868	br-k23	14	57	189080	It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea . 
8869	br-k23	15	58	189100	The brothers drove down together in Mark 's small red sports_car , Mark at_the_wheel . 
8870	br-k23	15	59	189115	They rarely spoke . 
8871	br-k23	15	60	189119	Abel sat and regarded the farm country which , spreading_out from both sides of the road , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields . 
8872	br-k23	15	61	189156	He saw the land with a stranger 's eyes , all the old familiarness gone . 
8873	br-k23	15	62	189172	And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself . 
8874	br-k23	15	63	189191	There was stability there , too - a color which his life had had once . 
8875	br-k23	15	64	189207	That is what childhood is , he told himself . 
8876	br-k23	15	65	189217	Solid , settled , lost . 
8877	br-k23	15	66	189223	In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone_poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt_Jessica 's letter . 
8878	br-k23	15	67	189242	What bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown . 
8879	br-k23	15	68	189255	The boyhood summers preceding their uncle 's funeral might never have been . 
8880	br-k23	15	69	189268	They had closed over , absolutely , with the sealing of old Izaak 's grave . 
8881	br-k23	15	70	189284	The small car flew_on relentlessly . 
8882	br-k23	15	71	189290	The old_woman , stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took_on an ominous reality . 
8883	br-k23	15	72	189307	Abel moved and adjusted his long legs . 
8884	br-k23	16	73	189315	`` I suppose it has to do with the property '' , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters . 
8885	br-k23	16	74	189343	Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted_out in one shameful moment of covetousness . 
8886	br-k23	16	75	189374	He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape_Ann property which had seemed to have no_end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer . 
8887	br-k23	17	76	189410	Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother . 
8888	br-k23	17	77	189421	Mark held the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he 'd make in the years to come . 
8889	br-k23	17	78	189458	His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away . 
8890	br-k23	17	79	189478	Mark easily looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized . 
8891	br-k23	18	80	189493	The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea . 
8892	br-k23	18	81	189505	`` She did n't mention bringing Myra '' , Mark said , maneuvering the car into the next lane . 
8893	br-k23	18	82	189525	`` She 's probably getting old - crotchety , I mean - and we figured uh-uh , better not . 
8894	br-k23	18	83	189545	They 've never met , you_know . 
8895	br-k23	18	84	189552	But Myra would n't budge without an express invitation . 
8896	br-k23	18	85	189562	I feel kind_of bad about it '' . 
8897	br-k23	18	86	189570	He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt . 
8898	br-k23	19	87	189598	`` I imagine the old girl has n't missed us much '' , Mark added , his eyes on the road . 
8899	br-k23	19	88	189620	Abel ignored the half expressed bid for confirmation . 
8900	br-k23	19	89	189629	He smiled . 
8901	br-k23	19	90	189632	It was barely possible that his brother was right . 
8902	br-k23	20	91	189642	He could tell they were approaching the sea . 
8903	br-k23	20	92	189651	The air took_on a special strength now that they 'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind . 
8904	br-k23	20	93	189670	There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt_water , clams , seaweed and northern air . 
8905	br-k23	20	94	189696	He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin wife as the last century ended . 
8906	br-k23	21	95	189750	Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming_upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant . 
8907	br-k23	21	96	189790	`` Remember the Starbird ? '' 
8908	br-k23	21	97	189796	Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came_down . 
8909	br-k23	22	98	189835	`` The_Starbird , '' Abel said . 
8910	br-k23	22	99	189842	There was the day Uncle_Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed_over the pretty sloop to Abel for_keeps , on_condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy wished . 
8911	br-k23	22	100	189880	The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team . 
8912	br-k23	22	101	189892	All_of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could . 
8913	br-k23	22	102	189918	They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually . 
8914	br-k23	22	103	189945	He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky . 
8915	br-k23	22	104	189972	Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run_up her sails . 
8916	br-k23	22	105	189999	The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay . 
8917	br-k23	23	106	190011	They came unexpectedly upon the sea . 
8918	br-k23	23	107	190018	Meeting it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them . 
8919	br-k23	23	108	190036	They were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness , became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended . 
8920	br-k23	23	109	190069	Mark stopped the car and switched_off the lights and they sat looking_at the water , which , there being no moon out , at_first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars . 
8921	br-k24	1	1	190106	His eyes were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky they 'd glare at my noise , growing red and raising_up his rage . 
8922	br-k24	1	2	190134	I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I could n't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go_up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling . 
8923	br-k24	1	3	190192	Oh he 'd not care about the Pedersen kid . 
8924	br-k24	1	4	190202	He 'd not care about getting waked so he could give_up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding_places in_the_bargain . 
8925	br-k24	1	5	190232	That would make him mad enough if he was sober . 
8926	br-k24	1	6	190243	I did n't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen . 
8927	br-k24	2	7	190260	He was all shoveled_up like I thought he 'd be . 
8928	br-k24	2	8	190271	I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name . 
8929	br-k24	2	9	190281	I think his name stopped the snoring but he did n't move except to roll a_little when I shoved him . 
8930	br-k24	2	10	190302	The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall - there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster - and I thought , Well you do n't look much like a pig-drunk bully now . 
8931	br-k24	2	11	190360	I could n't be sure he was still asleep . 
8932	br-k24	2	12	190370	He was a cagey sonofabitch . 
8933	br-k24	2	13	190376	I shook him a_little harder and made some noise . 
8934	br-k24	2	14	190386	`` Pap-pap-pap-hey '' , I said . 
8935	br-k24	3	15	190393	I was leaning too far over . 
8936	br-k24	3	16	190400	I knew better . 
8937	br-k24	3	17	190404	He always slept close_to the wall so you had to lean to reach him . 
8938	br-k24	3	18	190419	Oh he was smart . 
8939	br-k24	3	19	190424	It put you off . 
8940	br-k24	3	20	190429	I knew better but I was thinking_of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough . 
8941	br-k24	3	21	190445	When his arm came_up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck , watering my eyes , and I backed_off to cough . 
8942	br-k24	3	22	190473	Pa was on his side , looking at me , his eyes winking , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow . 
8943	br-k24	4	23	190499	`` Get the hell out of here '' . 
8944	br-k24	5	24	190508	I did n't say anything , trying to get my throat clear , but I watched him . 
8945	br-k24	5	25	190526	He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear . 
8946	br-k24	5	26	190539	It was better , though , he 'd hit me . 
8947	br-k24	5	27	190550	He was bitter when he missed . 
8948	br-k24	6	28	190557	`` Get the hell out of here '' . 
8949	br-k24	7	29	190566	`` Big_Hans sent me . 
8950	br-k24	7	30	190571	He told me to wake you '' . 
8951	br-k24	8	31	190579	`` A fat hell on Big_Hans . 
8952	br-k24	8	32	190586	Get_out of here '' . 
8953	br-k24	9	33	190591	`` He found the Pedersen kid by the crib '' . 
8954	br-k24	10	34	190602	`` Get the hell out '' . 
8955	br-k24	11	35	190609	Pa pulled at the covers . 
8956	br-k24	11	36	190615	He was tasting his mouth . 
8957	br-k24	12	37	190621	`` The kid 's froze good . 
8958	br-k24	12	38	190628	Hans is rubbing him with snow . 
8959	br-k24	12	39	190635	He 's got him in the kitchen '' . 
8960	br-k24	13	40	190644	`` Pedersen '' ? 
8961	br-k24	14	41	190648	`` No , Pa . 
8962	br-k24	14	42	190653	It 's the Pedersen kid . 
8963	br-k24	14	43	190659	The kid '' . 
8964	br-k24	15	44	190663	`` Nothing to steal from the crib '' . 
8965	br-k24	16	45	190672	`` Not stealing , Pa . 
8966	br-k24	16	46	190678	He was just lying there . 
8967	br-k24	16	47	190684	Hans found him froze . 
8968	br-k24	16	48	190689	That 's where he was when Hans found him '' . 
8969	br-k24	17	49	190700	Pa laughed . 
8970	br-k24	18	50	190703	`` I ai n't hid nothing in the crib '' . 
8971	br-k24	19	51	190714	`` You do n't understand , Pa . 
8972	br-k24	19	52	190722	The Pedersen kid . 
8973	br-k24	19	53	190726	The kid '' - 
8974	br-k24	20	54	190730	`` I god_damn well understand '' . 
8975	br-k24	21	55	190737	Pa had his head up , glaring , his teeth gnawing at the place where he 'd grown a mustache once . 
8976	br-k24	22	56	190759	`` I god_damn well understand . 
8977	br-k24	22	57	190765	You know I do n't want to see Pedersen . 
8978	br-k24	22	58	190775	That cock . 
8979	br-k24	22	59	190778	Why should I ? 
8980	br-k24	22	60	190782	What did he come for , hey ? 
8981	br-k24	22	61	190790	God_dammit , get . 
8982	br-k24	22	62	190794	And do n't come_back . 
8983	br-k24	22	63	190799	Find_out something . 
8984	br-k24	22	64	190802	You 're a fool . 
8985	br-k24	22	65	190807	Both you and Hans . 
8986	br-k24	22	66	190812	Pedersen . 
8987	br-k24	22	67	190814	That cock . 
8988	br-k24	22	68	190817	Do n't come_back . 
8989	br-k24	22	69	190821	Out . 
8990	br-k24	22	70	190823	Out '' . 
8991	br-k24	23	71	190826	He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow . 
8992	br-k24	23	72	190840	He had long black hairs on his wrist . 
8993	br-k24	23	73	190849	They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt . 
8994	br-k24	24	74	190858	`` Big_Hans made me come . 
8995	br-k24	24	75	190864	Big_Hans said '' - 
8996	br-k24	25	76	190868	`` A fat_hell on Big_Hans . 
8997	br-k24	25	77	190874	He 's an even bigger fool than you are . 
8998	br-k24	25	78	190884	Fat , hey ? 
8999	br-k24	25	79	190888	I taught him , dammit , and I 'll teach you . 
9000	br-k24	25	80	190900	Out . 
9001	br-k24	25	81	190902	You want me to drop my pot '' ? 
9002	br-k24	26	82	190911	He was_about_to get_up so I got_out , slamming the door . 
9003	br-k24	26	83	190922	He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep . 
9004	br-k24	26	84	190934	Then he threw things . 
9005	br-k24	26	85	190939	Once he went_after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister . 
9006	br-k24	26	86	190951	Pa 'd been shit sick in that pot . 
9007	br-k24	26	87	190960	Hans got an axe . 
9008	br-k24	26	88	190965	He did n't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa 's door down before he stopped . 
9009	br-k24	26	89	190987	He might not have gone_that_far if Pa had n't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house . 
9010	br-k24	26	90	191006	That pot put Pa in an awful good_humor whenever he thought_of it . 
9011	br-k24	26	91	191019	I always felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out . 
9012	br-k24	26	92	191051	I heard Pa cursing all_the_way downstairs . 
9013	br-k24	27	93	191058	Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid 's chest and stomach . 
9014	br-k24	27	94	191071	He was rubbing snow on the kid 's legs and feet . 
9015	br-k24	27	95	191083	Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning pasty , sticking_to the kid 's back and behind . 
9016	br-k24	28	96	191120	`` Ai n't he going_to wake_up '' ? 
9017	br-k24	29	97	191128	`` What about your pa '' ? 
9018	br-k24	30	98	191135	`` He was awake when I left '' . 
9019	br-k24	31	99	191144	`` What 'd he say ? 
9020	br-k24	31	100	191150	Did you get the whisky '' ? 
9021	br-k24	32	101	191157	`` He said a fat_hell on Big_Hans '' . 
9022	br-k24	33	102	191166	`` Do n't be smart . 
9023	br-k24	33	103	191172	Did you ask him about the whisky '' ? 
9024	br-k24	34	104	191181	`` Yeah '' . 
9025	br-k24	35	105	191185	`` Well '' ? 
9026	br-k24	36	106	191189	`` He said a fat_hell on Big_Hans '' . 
9027	br-k24	37	107	191198	`` Do n't be smart . 
9028	br-k24	37	108	191204	What 's he going_to do '' ? 
9029	br-k24	38	109	191211	`` Go_back to sleep most likely '' . 
9030	br-k24	39	110	191219	`` You 'd best get that whisky '' . 
9031	br-k24	40	111	191228	`` You go . 
9032	br-k24	40	112	191232	Take the axe . 
9033	br-k24	40	113	191236	Pa 's scared to hell of axes '' . 
9034	br-k24	41	114	191245	`` Listen to me , Jorge , I 've had enough to your sassing . 
9035	br-k24	41	115	191260	This kid 's froze bad . 
9036	br-k24	41	116	191266	If I do n't get some whisky down him he might die . 
9037	br-k24	41	117	191279	You want the kid to die ? 
9038	br-k24	41	118	191286	Do you ? 
9039	br-k24	41	119	191289	Well , get your pa and get that whisky '' . 
9040	br-k24	42	120	191300	`` Pa do n't care about the kid '' . 
9041	br-k24	43	121	191310	`` Jorge '' . 
9042	br-k24	44	122	191314	`` Well he do n't . 
9043	br-k24	44	123	191320	He do n't care at_all , and I do n't care to get my head busted neither . 
9044	br-k24	44	124	191338	He do n't care , and I do n't care to have his shit flung on me . 
9045	br-k24	44	125	191356	He do n't care about anybody . 
9046	br-k24	44	126	191363	All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face . 
9047	br-k24	44	127	191378	Get pig-drunk - that 's what he wants . 
9048	br-k24	44	128	191387	He do n't care about nothing else at_all . 
9049	br-k24	44	129	191396	Nothing . 
9050	br-k24	44	130	191398	Not Pedersen 's kid neither . 
9051	br-k24	44	131	191404	That cock . 
9052	br-k24	44	132	191407	Not the kid neither '' . 
9053	br-k24	45	133	191413	`` I 'll get the spirits '' , Ma said . 
9054	br-k24	46	134	191424	I 'd wound Big_Hans up tight . 
9055	br-k24	46	135	191431	I was ready to jump but when Ma said she 'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran_down . 
9056	br-k24	46	136	191457	Ma never went near the old_man when he was sleeping_it_off . 
9057	br-k24	46	137	191468	Not any_more . 
9058	br-k24	46	138	191471	Not for years . 
9059	br-k24	46	139	191475	The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he 'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock popping_out as it flew . 
9060	br-k24	46	140	191520	It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big_Hans to remember going_after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa 's yellow sick insides . 
9061	br-k24	47	141	191554	`` No you won't '' , Big_Hans said . 
9062	br-k24	48	142	191563	`` Yes , Hans , if they 're needed '' , Ma said . 
9063	br-k24	49	143	191577	Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her . 
9064	br-k24	49	144	191590	If we had , then one of us would have had to go instead . 
9065	br-k24	49	145	191605	Hans rubbed the kid with more snow & & & rubbed & & & rubbed . 
9066	br-k24	50	146	191621	`` I 'll get more snow '' , I said . 
9067	br-k24	50	147	191632	I took the pail and shovel and went_out on the porch . 
9068	br-k24	50	148	191644	I do n't know where Ma went . 
9069	br-k24	50	149	191652	I thought she 'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had . 
9070	br-k24	50	150	191665	She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she 'd go , and_then she surprised him again when she came_back so quick like she must have , because when I came_in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat . 
9071	br-k24	51	151	191726	Oh , he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm . 
9072	br-k24	51	152	191754	He was awful angry because he 'd thought Ma was going_to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her . 
9073	br-k24	51	153	191777	I know him . 
9074	br-k24	51	154	191781	I know him . 
9075	br-k24	51	155	191785	We felt the same sometimes , while Ma was n't thinking_about that at_all , not anything like that . 
9076	br-k24	51	156	191804	There was no way of getting_even . 
9077	br-k24	51	157	191811	It was n't like getting cheated at the fair . 
9078	br-k24	51	158	191821	They were always trying so you got_to expect it . 
9079	br-k24	51	159	191831	Now Hans had given Ma something of his - we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa - something valuable ; but since she did n't know we 'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back . 
9080	br-k24	52	160	191879	Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap . 
9081	br-k24	52	161	191890	He was put_out too because there was only one way of understanding what she 'd done . 
9082	br-k24	52	162	191907	Ma had found one of Pa 's hiding_places . 
9083	br-k24	52	163	191916	She 'd found one and she had n't said a word while Big_Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one . 
9084	br-k24	52	164	191964	Pa had a knack for hiding . 
9085	br-k24	52	165	191971	He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it . 
9086	br-k24	52	166	191981	But now Ma . 
9087	br-k24	52	167	191985	She 'd found it by_luck most likely but she had n't said anything and we did n't know how long_ago it 'd been or how many other ones she 'd found , saying nothing . 
9088	br-k24	52	168	192020	Pa was sure to find_out . 
9089	br-k24	52	169	192026	Sometimes he did n't seem to because he hid them so well he could n't find them himself or because he looked and did n't find anything and figured he had n't hid one after_all or had drunk it up . 
9090	br-k24	52	170	192067	But he 'd find_out about this one because we were using it . 
9091	br-k24	52	171	192080	A fool could see what was going_on . 
9092	br-k24	52	172	192088	If he found_out Ma found it - that 'd be bad . 
9093	br-k24	52	173	192100	He took_pride in his hiding . 
9094	br-k24	52	174	192106	It was all the pride he had . 
9095	br-k24	52	175	192114	I guess fooling Hans and me took doing . 
9096	br-k24	52	176	192123	But he did n't figure Ma for much . 
9097	br-k24	52	177	192132	He did n't figure her at_all , and if he found_out * * h a woman * * h it 'd be bad . 
9098	br-k24	53	178	192156	Hans poured some in a tumbler . 
9099	br-k24	54	179	192163	`` You going_to put more towels on him '' ? 
9100	br-k24	55	180	192173	`` No '' . 
9101	br-k24	56	181	192177	`` Why not ? 
9102	br-k24	56	182	192181	That 's what he needs , something warm to his skin , do n't he '' ? 
9103	br-k24	57	183	192198	`` Not where he 's froze good . 
9104	br-k24	57	184	192206	Heat 's bad for frostbite . 
9105	br-k24	57	185	192212	That 's why I only put towels on his chest and belly . 
9106	br-k24	57	186	192225	He 's_got to thaw slow . 
9107	br-k24	57	187	192231	You ought to know that '' . 
9108	br-k24	58	188	192238	Colors on the towels had run . 
9109	br-k24	59	189	192245	Ma poked her toe in the kid 's clothes . 
9110	br-k24	60	190	192255	`` What are we going_to do with these '' ? 
9111	br-k24	61	191	192265	Big_Hans began pouring whisky in the kid 's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin . 
9112	br-k24	62	192	192295	`` Here , help me prop him up . 
9113	br-k24	62	193	192304	I got_hold his mouth open '' . 
9114	br-k24	63	194	192311	I did n't want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid 's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and did n't make any move to . 
9115	br-k24	64	195	192353	`` Come_on , Jorge '' . 
9116	br-k24	65	196	192359	`` All_right '' . 
9117	br-k24	66	197	192363	`` Lift , do n't shove * * h lift '' . 
9118	br-k24	67	198	192375	`` O.K. , I'm lifting '' . 
9119	br-k24	68	199	192382	I took him by the shoulders . 
9120	br-k24	68	200	192389	His head flopped back . 
9121	br-k24	68	201	192394	His mouth fell_open . 
9122	br-k24	68	202	192398	The skin on his neck was tight . 
9123	br-k24	68	203	192406	He was cold all_right . 
9124	br-k24	69	204	192411	`` Hold his head up . 
9125	br-k24	69	205	192417	He 'll choke '' . 
9126	br-k24	70	206	192422	`` His mouth is open '' . 
9127	br-k24	71	207	192429	`` His throat 's shut . 
9128	br-k24	71	208	192435	He 'll choke '' . 
9129	br-k24	72	209	192440	`` He 'll choke anyway '' . 
9130	br-k24	73	210	192447	`` Hold his head up '' . 
9131	br-k24	74	211	192454	`` I can n't '' . 
9132	br-k24	75	212	192460	`` Do n't hold him like that . 
9133	br-k24	75	213	192468	Put your arms around him '' . 
9134	br-k24	76	214	192475	`` Well_Jesus '' . 
9135	br-k24	77	215	192479	He was cold all_right . 
9136	br-k24	77	216	192484	I put my arm carefully around him . 
9137	br-k24	77	217	192492	Hans had his fingers in the kid 's mouth . 
9138	br-k24	78	218	192502	`` Now he 'll choke for_sure '' . 
9139	br-k24	79	219	192510	`` Shut_up . 
9140	br-k24	79	220	192513	Just hold him like I told you '' . 
9141	br-k24	80	221	192522	He was cold all_right , and wet . 
9142	br-k24	80	222	192530	I had my arm behind his back . 
9143	br-k25	1	1	192538	He was in his mid_fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once_again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn_off lecturing . 
9144	br-k25	1	2	192575	There was never a doubt any_more how his structures would be received ; it was always the same unqualified success now . 
9145	br-k25	1	3	192597	He could no_longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here_and_there he was taken_to_task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no_longer disputable as to its other values . 
9146	br-k25	1	4	192693	Stowey_Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality . 
9147	br-k25	1	5	192728	He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rose at half past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn_flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald_Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh_Gazette , then put_on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop . 
9148	br-k25	1	6	192805	This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil_geologist . 
9149	br-k25	1	7	192834	The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window_sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting_out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass_through a whole house , visible all_the_way up through wire gratings on each floor . 
9150	br-k25	1	8	192920	His files , desk , drafting_board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos . 
9151	br-k25	1	9	192939	Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as_though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac . 
9152	br-k25	1	10	192984	Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden_Cycly_Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller_skates which he occasionally used up_and_down front of his house . 
9153	br-k25	1	11	193037	He worked standing , with his left hand in his pocket as_though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person 's hand . 
9154	br-k25	1	12	193072	Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved . 
9155	br-k25	1	13	193099	It all seemed - if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows - as_though this broken nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler 's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss 's work . 
9156	br-k25	1	14	193143	This air of disengagement carried_over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine . 
9157	br-k25	1	15	193172	But he was not bored at_all ; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it . 
9158	br-k25	1	16	193212	There are , after_all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man . 
9159	br-k25	2	17	193248	He left his home the day after New_Year 's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat . 
9160	br-k25	2	18	193268	He would wear this same costume in Florida , despite his wife Cleota 's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him . 
9161	br-k25	2	19	193298	But he was too busy to hear what she was saying . 
9162	br-k25	2	20	193310	So they parted when she was in an impatient humor . 
9163	br-k25	2	21	193321	When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station_wagon , feeling in his trouser_cuffs for the ignition_key which he had dropped a moment before , she came_out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window . 
9164	br-k25	2	22	193386	Finding the key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed_up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , `` Defrost the refrigerator '' . 
9165	br-k25	3	23	193422	He saw the surprise in her face , and laughed as_though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen . 
9166	br-k25	3	24	193443	He kept_on laughing until she started laughing with him . 
9167	br-k25	3	25	193453	He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good_humor ; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it . 
9168	br-k25	3	26	193481	He would settle himself into his seat to laugh . 
9169	br-k25	3	27	193491	Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing . 
9170	br-k25	3	28	193501	And she was made to fall_in_love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog , mad as she was at his going_away when he really did n't have to , mad at their both got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go_by . 
9171	br-k25	3	29	193559	She was forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long_ago for a stubborn sort of prayer . 
9172	br-k25	3	30	193599	Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders . 
9173	br-k25	3	31	193628	There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are_born at the end of an ancestral line long_since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact . 
9174	br-k25	3	32	193673	She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves . 
9175	br-k25	3	33	193719	But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come_down bathed , brushed , and taking_breaths of air , and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so_to_speak , and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value . 
9176	br-k25	3	34	193796	She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp . 
9177	br-k25	4	35	193821	`` Now drive carefully , for_God's_sake '' ! she called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure . 
9178	br-k25	4	36	193843	But he did not notice , and was already backing the car down to the road , saying `` Toot-toot '' ! to the stump of a tree as he passed it , the same stump which had impaled the car of many_a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed . 
9179	br-k25	4	37	193900	She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road . 
9180	br-k25	4	38	193918	Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window . 
9181	br-k25	4	39	193939	She had begun to turn_back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood_still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word_of_farewell . 
9182	br-k25	4	40	193970	He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at_a_time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a_little and his breath came hard through his nicotine choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate_Gallery on a Thursday once . 
9183	br-k25	4	41	194037	Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure_enough he pointed at her with his index_finger and said `` Toot '' ! once_more and roared_off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked . 
9184	br-k25	4	42	194092	She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building . 
9185	br-k25	4	43	194115	There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind . 
9186	br-k25	5	44	194135	She enjoyed great parties when she would sit_up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the realest part of life . 
9187	br-k25	5	45	194174	Now she could let out the three parakeets without_fear they would be stepped_on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; she could dust the plants , then break_off suddenly and pick_up an old novel and read from the middle on ; improvise cha-chas on the harp ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as_well_as the news , registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire . 
9188	br-k25	5	46	194277	She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting_to be . 
9189	br-k25	5	47	194306	She fell_asleep leaning_on her hand , hearing the house creaking as_though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm . 
9190	br-k25	5	48	194367	Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers . 
9191	br-k25	5	49	194420	Then she fell_asleep again as suddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes . 
9192	br-k25	5	50	194449	She stood_up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming_in or going_out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in_a_moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests . 
9193	br-k25	5	51	194546	She went_into the living_room and turned_on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned_on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway . 
9194	br-k25	5	52	194581	She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself . 
9195	br-k25	5	53	194593	They were both so young , after_all , so unready for any final parting . 
9196	br-k25	5	54	194608	How could it have been thirty years already , she wondered ? 
9197	br-k25	5	55	194620	But yes , nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine , and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen . 
9198	br-k25	5	56	194641	She stood_still over the leg_of_lamb , rubbing herbs into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath , a sensation of violence that started her shivering . 
9199	br-k26	1	1	194676	But they all said , `` No , your time will come . 
9200	br-k26	1	2	194689	Enjoy being a bride while you can '' . 
9201	br-k26	2	3	194698	There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning_House ( where the Albright boys always took their brides , till they could get a house and a farm of their own ) . 
9202	br-k26	2	4	194732	So when the Big_House filled_up and ran_over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes . 
9203	br-k26	2	5	194751	And there was still not anything that Linda_Kay could do . 
9204	br-k26	3	6	194762	So Linda_Kay gave_up asking , and accepted her reprieve . 
9205	br-k26	3	7	194772	Without saying so , she was really grateful ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought_of the duties she would have as Bobby_Joe 's wife . 
9206	br-k26	3	8	194811	She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby_Joe . 
9207	br-k26	3	9	194845	She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought_of this . 
9208	br-k26	3	10	194866	People died , she would have said , in hospitals , or in cars on the highway at night . 
9209	br-k26	4	11	194886	Bobby_Joe was gone all day now , not coming_in for dinner and sometimes not for supper . 
9210	br-k26	4	12	194903	When they first married he had been working in the fields all day , and she would get_in the car and drive to wherever he was working , to take him a fresh hot meal . 
9211	br-k26	4	13	194939	Now there was no work in the fields , nor would there be till it rained , and she did not know where he went . 
9212	br-k26	4	14	194965	Not that she complained , or had any cause to . 
9213	br-k26	4	15	194976	Four or five of the cousins from East_Texas were about his age , so naturally they ran_around together . 
9214	br-k26	4	16	194995	There was no reason for her to ask what they did . 
9215	br-k26	5	17	195007	Thus a new pattern of days began to develop , for Granny_Albright did not die . 
9216	br-k26	5	18	195023	She lay still on the bed , her head hardly denting the pillow ; sometimes she opened her eyes and looked_around , and sometimes she took a_little milk or soup . 
9217	br-k26	5	19	195054	They stopped expecting her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two . 
9218	br-k26	5	20	195073	Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go_home , for she might die any time ; but they might as_well unpack their suitcases , for she might linger on . 
9219	br-k26	6	21	195108	So the pattern was established . 
9220	br-k26	6	22	195114	When Linda_Kay had put_up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs , she would go_to the Big_House . 
9221	br-k26	6	23	195133	There was not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be . 
9222	br-k26	6	24	195153	Bobby_Joe and the boys would come_by , say `` How 's Granny '' ? and sit on the porch a while . 
9223	br-k26	6	25	195175	The older men would be there at noon , and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town . 
9224	br-k26	7	26	195207	The women and children stayed_at the Albrights ' . 
9225	br-k26	7	27	195216	The women , keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living_room , sounded like chickens shut_up in a coop for the night . 
9226	br-k26	7	28	195246	The children had to play away from the house ( in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn ) , to maintain a proper quietness . 
9227	br-k26	8	29	195274	Off_and_on , all day , someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything . 
9228	br-k26	8	30	195293	The evaporative_cooler had been moved to Granny 's room , and her door was kept shut ; so that the rest of the house stayed open , though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way . 
9229	br-k26	9	31	195336	The dust clogged their throats , and the heat parched them , so that the women were always making ice_water . 
9230	br-k26	9	32	195357	They had cleaned_up an old ice_box and begun to buy fifty pound blocks of ice in town , as the electric_refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there . 
9231	br-k26	10	33	195393	One afternoon , as the women sat clucking softly , a new carload of people pulled_up at the gate . 
9232	br-k26	10	34	195413	It was a Cadillac , black grayed with the dust of the road , its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of_it would be cool and unwrinkled . 
9233	br-k26	10	35	195447	They were an old fat couple ( as Linda_Kay described them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man , and a girl about ten or twelve . 
9234	br-k26	11	36	195475	There was much embracing , much exclaiming . 
9235	br-k26	11	37	195483	`` Cousin_Ada ! 
9236	br-k26	11	38	195486	Cousin_John '' ! 
9237	br-k26	11	39	195489	`` Cousin_Lura '' ! 
9238	br-k26	11	40	195493	`` Cousin_Howard '' ! 
9239	br-k26	11	41	195497	`` And how is she '' ? 
9240	br-k26	11	42	195504	`` About the same , John , about the same '' . 
9241	br-k26	12	43	195516	All the women got_up and offered their chairs , and when they were all seated again , the guests made their inquiries and their explanations . 
9242	br-k26	13	44	195542	`` We were on our vacation in Canada '' , Howard explained , in a muffled voice that must have been used_to booming , `` and the news did n't catch_up_with us till we were nearly home . 
9243	br-k26	13	45	195580	We came_on as_soon_as we could '' . 
9244	br-k26	14	46	195587	There was the suggestion of ice_water , and - in_spite of the protest `` We 're not really thirsty '' - Linda_Kay , to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices , hurried to the kitchen . 
9245	br-k26	15	47	195626	She filled a big pitcher and set it , with glasses , on a tray . 
9246	br-k26	15	48	195642	Carrying it to the living_room , she imagined the picture she made : tall and roundly slim , a_bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath , with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band . 
9247	br-k26	15	49	195684	Almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain , at such a time , in such a place , and she tossed_back her long yellow hair , smiling shyly as she entered the room . 
9248	br-k26	16	50	195721	Howard ( the thick middle-aged man ) was looking at her . 
9249	br-k26	16	51	195733	She felt the look and looked back because she could not help it , seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at_first believed . 
9250	br-k26	17	52	195763	`` And who is this '' ? he asked , when she passed him a glass . 
9251	br-k26	18	53	195780	`` Oh that 's Linda_Kay '' , Mama_Albright said fondly . 
9252	br-k26	18	54	195791	`` She married our baby boy , Bobby_Joe , this summer '' . 
9253	br-k26	19	55	195804	`` Let 's see '' , Cousin_Ada said . 
9254	br-k26	19	56	195813	`` He 's a right_smart younger than the rest '' ? 
9255	br-k26	20	57	195824	`` Oh yes '' , Mama laughed . 
9256	br-k26	20	58	195832	`` He 's ten years younger than Ernest . 
9257	br-k26	20	59	195841	We did n't expect him to come_along ; thought for the longest he was a tumor '' . 
9258	br-k26	21	60	195859	This joke was not funny to Linda_Kay , and she blushed , as she always did ; then , hearing the muffled boom of Howard 's laughter , blushed redder . 
9259	br-k26	22	61	195890	`` Who is Howard , anyway '' ? she asked Bobby_Joe that night . 
9260	br-k26	22	62	195904	`` He makes me uncomfortable '' . 
9261	br-k26	23	63	195911	`` Oh he 's a second_cousin or something . 
9262	br-k26	23	64	195920	He got_in the oil_business out at Odessa and lucked_into some money '' . 
9263	br-k26	24	65	195933	`` How old is he '' ? 
9264	br-k26	25	66	195940	`` Gosh , I do n't know . 
9265	br-k26	25	67	195948	Thirty-five , I guess . 
9266	br-k26	25	68	195953	He 's been married and got this half grown kid . 
9267	br-k26	25	69	195964	If he bothers you , do n't pay him any mind . 
9268	br-k26	25	70	195976	He 's just a big windbag '' . 
9269	br-k26	25	71	195984	Bobby_Joe was thinking_about something else . 
9270	br-k26	25	72	195990	`` Say , did you know they 're fixing to have a two day antelope season on the Double_X '' ? 
9271	br-k26	26	73	196011	He was talking_about antelope again when they woke_up . 
9272	br-k26	26	74	196020	`` Listen , I never had a chance to kill an antelope . 
9273	br-k26	26	75	196033	There never was a season before , but now they want to thin 'em out on_account_of the drouth '' . 
9274	br-k26	27	76	196053	`` Did he ever visit here when he was a kid '' ? 
9275	br-k26	27	77	196066	Linda_Kay asked . 
9276	br-k26	28	78	196069	`` Who '' ? 
9277	br-k26	29	79	196073	`` Howard '' . 
9278	br-k26	30	80	196077	`` Hell , I do n't know . 
9279	br-k26	30	81	196085	When he was a kid I was n't around '' . 
9280	br-k26	31	82	196096	Bobby_Joe took a gun from behind the door , and with a quick `` Bye_now '' was gone for the day . 
9281	br-k26	32	83	196118	Almost immediately Howard and his daughter Debora drove_up in the Cadillac . 
9282	br-k26	33	84	196130	`` We 're going_after ice '' , Howard said , `` and thought maybe you 'd go along and keep us company '' . 
9283	br-k26	34	85	196154	There was really no reason to refuse , and Linda_Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac . 
9284	br-k26	35	86	196171	Driving along the caliche-topped road to town , Howard talked . 
9285	br-k26	35	87	196182	Finally he said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda_Kay told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life . 
9286	br-k26	35	88	196210	She was such a well-rounded teenager , having been a twirler , Future_Farmers sweetheart , and secretary of Future_Homemakers . 
9287	br-k26	35	89	196230	In her sophomore year she had started going_steady with Bobby_Joe , who was a football_player , Future_Homemakers sweetheart , and president of Future_Farmers . 
9288	br-k26	35	90	196254	It was easy to see that they were made_for each other , and they knew what they wanted . 
9289	br-k26	35	91	196273	Bobby_Joe would be a senior this year , and he planned to graduate . 
9290	br-k26	35	92	196287	But there was no need for Linda_Kay to go_on , since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby_Joe and ( blushing ) raise his children . 
9291	br-k26	36	93	196318	Howard sighed . 
9292	br-k26	36	94	196321	`` You lucky kids '' , he said . 
9293	br-k26	36	95	196330	`` I 'd give anything if I could have found a girl like you '' . 
9294	br-k26	36	96	196346	Then he told Linda_Kay about himself . 
9295	br-k26	36	97	196353	Of_course he could n't say much , really , because of Debora , but Linda_Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw_deal he had_got . 
9296	br-k26	36	98	196385	It made her feel different about Howard . 
9297	br-k26	37	99	196393	She was going_to tell Bobby_Joe about how mistaken she had been , but he brought one of the cousins home for supper , and all they did was talk_about antelope . 
9298	br-k26	38	100	196424	Bobby_Joe was trying to get Linda_Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home . 
9299	br-k26	39	101	196442	`` Cook a whole antelope '' ? she exclaimed . 
9300	br-k26	39	102	196452	`` Why , I could n't even cook a piece of antelope steak ; I never even saw any '' . 
9301	br-k26	40	103	196473	`` Oh , you could . 
9302	br-k26	40	104	196479	I want to roast the whole_thing , and have it for the boys '' . 
9303	br-k26	41	105	196494	Linda_Kay told him he could n't do anything like that with his Grandma dying , and he said well they had_to eat , did n't they , they were n't all dying . 
9304	br-k26	41	106	196527	Linda_Kay felt_like going_off to the bedroom to cry ; but they were going_up to the Big_House after supper , and she had_to put_on a clean dress and fix her hair a_little . 
9305	br-k26	42	107	196559	Every_night they all went_to Mama and Papa Albright 's , and sat on the open front_porch , where they could get the breeze . 
9306	br-k26	42	108	196583	It was full-of-the-moon ( or a_little past ) , and nearly light as day . 
9307	br-k26	42	109	196598	They all sat around and drank ice_water , and the men smoked , and everybody had a good time . 
9308	br-k26	42	110	196618	Once_in_a_while they said what a shame it was , with Granny dying , but they all agreed she would n't have wanted it any other way . 
9309	br-k26	43	111	196645	That night the older men got_to talking_about going possum hunting on a moonlight night . 
9310	br-k26	43	112	196660	Bobby_Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum hunting , and Uncle_Bill_Farnworth ( from Mama_Albright 's side of the family ) said he would just get_up from there and take them , right then . 
9311	br-k26	44	113	196702	After they had left , some of the people moved around , to find more comfortable places to sit . 
9312	br-k26	44	114	196722	There were not many chairs , so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch , resting their feet on the ground , and_others liked to sit where they could lean_back against the wall . 
9313	br-k26	44	115	196760	Howard , who had been sitting against the wall , said he needed more fresh air , and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby_Joe had been sitting . 
9314	br-k26	45	116	196793	`` You 'll be a darn sight more comfortable there , Howard '' , Ernest said , laughing , and they all laughed . 
9315	br-k26	46	117	196817	Linda_Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable . 
9316	br-k26	46	118	196827	Bobby_Joe had been sitting close to her , touching her actually , and holding her hand from_time_to_time , but it seemed at_once that Howard sat much closer . 
9317	br-k26	46	119	196855	Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh , so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers ; but she had never been so aware of anyone 's flesh before . 
9318	br-k26	47	120	196893	Still she was not sorry he sat by her , but in_fact was flattered . 
9319	br-k26	47	121	196908	He had become the center of the company , such stories he had to tell . 
9320	br-k26	47	122	196924	He had sold oil stock to Bob_Hope and Bing_Crosby in_person ; he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights . 
9321	br-k27	1	1	196949	`` But tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the hatching '' ? 
9322	br-k27	1	2	196966	Alex asked . 
9323	br-k27	2	3	196969	`` That will have to be in the hotel '' , the doctor retorted , confirming Alex 's anticipations . 
9324	br-k27	2	4	196989	`` What I want you to do is to go_to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel '' . 
9325	br-k27	3	5	197017	The doctor paid the bill and they repaired_to the hotel , room number nine , to initiate Alex further into these undertakings . 
9326	br-k27	4	6	197040	The doctor opened the smallest of his cases , an unimposing straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex 's inspection . 
9327	br-k27	4	7	197063	Inside , carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens ' eggs . 
9328	br-k27	4	8	197104	There was little enough time to contemplate them , however ; in an instant the doctor was stalking across the room with an antique ledger in his hands , thoroughly eared and big as a table_top . 
9329	br-k27	4	9	197141	He placed it on Alex 's lap . 
9330	br-k27	5	10	197149	`` This is my hen ledger '' , he informed him in an absorbed way . 
9331	br-k27	5	11	197165	`` It 's been going since 1908 when I was a junior in college . 
9332	br-k27	5	12	197180	That first entry there is the Vermont_Flumenophobe , the earliest and one of the most successful of my eighty-three varieties - great big scapulars and hardly any primaries at_all . 
9333	br-k27	5	13	197210	Could n't take them near a river , though , or they 'd squawk like a turkey_cock the day before Thanksgiving '' . 
9334	br-k27	6	14	197233	The ledger was full of most precise information : 
9335	br-k27	6	15	197242	date of laying , length of incubation_period , number of chicks reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster 's wattles and_so_on , all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than English , the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen . 
9336	br-k27	6	16	197298	Below these particulars was a series of alpha beta gammas connected by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed . 
9337	br-k27	6	17	197321	Alex 's instruction was rapid , for the doctor had_to go_off to the Rue_Ecole_de_Medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all . 
9338	br-k27	6	18	197354	But after the doctor 's return that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its egg hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen . 
9339	br-k27	7	19	197409	A knocking at Alex 's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning . 
9340	br-k27	7	20	197424	It was the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in_haste . 
9341	br-k27	7	21	197448	The doctor stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the still dark hallways , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street . 
9342	br-k27	7	22	197496	The market was not far and , once there , the doctor 's sense of immediacy left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him . 
9343	br-k27	7	23	197528	He stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks , he gobbled with the turkeys and they at_once were all attention , he quacked with the ducks , and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese . 
9344	br-k27	7	24	197567	The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done_with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery . 
9345	br-k27	7	25	197590	It was a fine broody_hen , white , with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen . 
9346	br-k27	7	26	197616	The doctor , with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope , drew Alex 's attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color in comb and wattles , the length and quality of neck and saddle_hackles , the firm , wide spread of the toes , and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets . 
9347	br-k27	7	27	197684	All search was ended ; he had found his fowl . 
9348	br-k27	7	28	197695	The purchase was effected and they made_their_way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set_up , nestling in the doctor 's arms . 
9349	br-k27	8	29	197727	The clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance ; and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex 's well exercised breast . 
9350	br-k27	8	30	197759	The doctor was wearing a long New_England greatcoat , hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens . 
9351	br-k27	8	31	197787	Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who , for all his care , manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled . 
9352	br-k27	8	32	197817	They advanced in a line across the entrance_hall to the stairway and up , with gingerly steps , towards the first landing . 
9353	br-k27	8	33	197840	It was then that they heard the tread of one descending and , in some perturbation glancing up , saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing . 
9354	br-k27	9	34	197871	`` Bonjour , messieurs , vous etes matinals '' , she greeted them pleasantly . 
9355	br-k27	9	35	197886	Alex explained that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around behind him , attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind Alex 's arm and back . 
9356	br-k27	10	36	197922	`` Vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors '' ? their hostess enquired . 
9357	br-k27	10	37	197938	Alex told her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts , trying at_the_same_time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him . 
9358	br-k27	10	38	197965	The doctor , he noticed , was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well . 
9359	br-k27	10	39	198002	Eyes swerved in the patronne 's head , Alex coughed loudly , and the doctor , with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him , took to the stairs in long_shanked leaps . 
9360	br-k27	11	40	198036	`` Comment '' ? ejaculated the surprised woman , looking at Alex for an explanation but he , parting from her without ceremony , only offered a_few words about the doctor 's provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought_on by the demands of his work . 
9361	br-k27	11	41	198084	With_that he hurried up_the_stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze . 
9362	br-k27	12	42	198095	When Alex entered his room , the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case , six eggs ready for the hen 's attentions . 
9363	br-k27	12	43	198122	There was no reference to the incident on the stairs , his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business . 
9364	br-k27	12	44	198143	The hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle_down to the performance of them . 
9365	br-k27	12	45	198165	One part of her audience was totally engaged , the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the connoisseur , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in_that which he does not fully understand . 
9366	br-k27	12	46	198213	The spectacle progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote ; the audience attended . 
9367	br-k27	12	47	198229	Time elapsed but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature . 
9368	br-k27	12	48	198253	Startled , he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view , and Alex went_to the door . 
9369	br-k27	12	49	198273	He opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling , coughing , and scraping noise as possible in_order to drown emanations from the hen who had begun to protest . 
9370	br-k27	12	50	198307	It was Giselle , the fille_de_chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears pricked_up and regard all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird . 
9371	br-k27	12	51	198359	Giselle was reluctant but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come_back in five minutes and the door was shut again . 
9372	br-k27	13	52	198380	`` Who was that , young feller '' ? the doctor instantly asked . 
9373	br-k27	14	53	198394	`` That was the fille_de_chambre , the one you thought could n't get the eggs out . 
9374	br-k27	14	54	198411	She looked mighty interested , though . 
9375	br-k27	14	55	198418	Anyhow she 's coming_back in five minutes to do the room '' . 
9376	br-k27	15	56	198431	The doctor 's mind was working at a great speed ; he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed Alex in a muted voice . 
9377	br-k27	16	57	198457	`` Have you got our keys handy '' ? 
9378	br-k27	17	58	198466	`` Right in my pocket '' . 
9379	br-k27	18	59	198473	`` All_right . 
9380	br-k27	18	60	198476	Now you go outside and beckon me when it 's safe '' . 
9381	br-k27	18	61	198489	The hall was empty and Alex beckoned ; they climbed the stairs which creaked , very_loudly to their sensitive ears , and reached the next floor . 
9382	br-k27	18	62	198516	A guest was locking his room ; they passed behind him and got to Alex 's room unnoticed . 
9383	br-k27	18	63	198535	The doctor sat_down rather wearily , caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry loving man , but no_sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once_more . 
9384	br-k27	18	64	198582	At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille_de_chambre to return in ten minutes . 
9385	br-k27	18	65	198599	It was evident that a second transfer had to be effected , and that it had to take_place between the time the fille finished the doctor 's room and the time she began Alex 's . 
9386	br-k27	18	66	198635	They waited three minutes and_then crept out on tip-toe ; the halls were empty and they passed down_the_stairs to number nine and listened at the door . 
9387	br-k27	18	67	198662	A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille_de_chambre 's presence inside ; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact . 
9388	br-k27	18	68	198693	The doctor shot_down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory was occupied . 
9389	br-k27	18	69	198714	Although a look of alarm passed_over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower_room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine . 
9390	br-k27	18	70	198743	Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat ; unwarranted they were in_any_case for , as he stood facing the fille_de_chambre , his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower_room . 
9391	br-k27	18	71	198789	The events of the last quarter of an hour , mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard , had overcome the doctor 's hen and she gave_out a series of cackly wails , perhaps mourning her nest , but briefly enjoyed . 
9392	br-k27	18	72	198838	The doctor 's wits had not left him , however , for all his sixty-eight years , and the wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing_out from the showerhead . 
9393	br-k27	18	73	198872	Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking_place and entered the doctor 's room . 
9394	br-k27	18	74	198890	Shortly , the doctor himself entered , his hair somewhat wet from the shower , but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures . 
9395	br-k27	18	75	198915	Without comment he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside . 
9396	br-k27	18	76	198941	Next , the hen was nested and all seemed well . 
9397	br-k27	18	77	198952	The two men sat for some time , savoring the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings , before they got_up and left the hotel , the doctor to go_to the conference_house and Alex to go_to the main post_office . 
9398	br-k27	19	78	198996	Alex returned to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospects of a role , in the late afternoon , but found the doctor in an ebullient mood . 
9399	br-k27	19	79	199027	At the time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen , who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of the morning . 
9400	br-k27	20	80	199061	`` Chickens have short memories '' , the doctor remarked , `` that 's why they are better company than most people I know '' , and he went_on to break some important news to Alex . 
9401	br-k27	20	81	199098	`` Well '' , he began , `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference_house do . 
9402	br-k27	20	82	199128	They 've got a big vulture from Tanganika at the zoo here , with a wife for him , too , very rare birds , both of them , the only Vulturidae of their species outside Africa . 
9403	br-k27	20	83	199166	Seems like she 's willing , but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy who took Jeannie_May behind the barn and_then did n't know what to do , and the people at the zoo have n't got any vulture chicks to show for their trouble . 
9404	br-k28	1	1	199216	Going downstairs with the tray , Winston wished he could have given_in to Miss_Ada , but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little girl look . 
9405	br-k28	1	2	199249	There were times it was n't right to make a person happy , like the times she came_in the kitchen and asked for a peanut_butter sandwich . 
9406	br-k28	1	3	199276	`` You know we do n't keep peanut_butter in_this house '' , he always told her . 
9407	br-k28	1	4	199293	`` Why , Winston '' , she 'd cry , `` I just_now saw you eating it out of the jar '' ! 
9408	br-k28	1	5	199316	But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure . 
9409	br-k28	2	6	199330	In the kitchen , Leona , his little young wife , was reading the morning paper . 
9410	br-k28	2	7	199347	Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool . 
9411	br-k28	3	8	199362	`` Here '' , Winston said gently , `` what 's these dishes doing not washed '' ? 
9412	br-k28	3	9	199380	The enormous plates which had held Mr._Jack 's four fried_eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink . 
9413	br-k28	4	10	199402	`` Leave me alone '' , Leona said . 
9414	br-k28	4	11	199411	`` Ca n't you see I'm busy '' ? 
9415	br-k28	4	12	199420	She looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper . 
9416	br-k28	5	13	199432	`` This is moving day '' , Winston reminded her , `` and I bet you left things every_which_way upstairs , your clothes all_over the floor and the bed not made . 
9417	br-k28	5	14	199464	Leona '' ! 
9418	br-k28	5	15	199467	His eye had fastened on her leg ; bending , he touched her knee . 
9419	br-k28	5	16	199482	`` If I catch you one more time down here without stockings '' - 
9420	br-k28	6	17	199496	She twitched her leg away . 
9421	br-k28	6	18	199502	`` Fuss , fuss , old_man '' . 
9422	br-k28	6	19	199510	She had an alley_cat 's manners . 
9423	br-k28	7	20	199517	Winston stacked Miss_Ada 's thin pink dishes in the sink . 
9424	br-k28	7	21	199528	Then he spread_out the last list on the counter . 
9425	br-k28	7	22	199538	`` To Be Left Behind '' was printed at the top in Miss_Ada ; fine hand . 
9426	br-k28	7	23	199555	Winston took_out a pencil , admired the point , and wrote slowly and heavily , `` Clothes Stand '' . 
9427	br-k28	8	24	199575	Sighing , Leona dropped the paper and stood_up . 
9428	br-k28	8	25	199584	`` I guess I better get ready to go '' . 
9429	br-k28	9	26	199595	Winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron . 
9430	br-k28	9	27	199604	`` Here '' . 
9431	br-k28	9	28	199608	Carefully , he undid the bow . 
9432	br-k28	9	29	199615	`` How_come your bows is always cockeyed '' ? 
9433	br-k28	10	30	199624	She turned and put her arms around his neck . 
9434	br-k28	10	31	199634	`` I do n't want to leave here , Winston '' . 
9435	br-k28	11	32	199646	`` Now listen to that '' . 
9436	br-k28	11	33	199653	He drew_back , embarrassed and pleased . 
9437	br-k28	11	34	199660	`` I thought you was sick_to_death of_this big house . 
9438	br-k28	11	35	199670	Said you wore yourself out , cleaning all these empty rooms '' . 
9439	br-k28	12	36	199683	`` At_least there is room here '' , she said . 
9440	br-k28	12	37	199694	`` What room is there going_to be in an apartment for any child '' ? 
9441	br-k28	13	38	199709	`` I told you what Miss_Ada 's doctor said '' . 
9442	br-k28	14	39	199720	`` I do n't mean Miss_Ada ! 
9443	br-k28	14	40	199727	What you think I care about that ? 
9444	br-k28	14	41	199735	I mean our children '' . 
9445	br-k28	14	42	199741	She sounded as though they already existed . 
9446	br-k28	15	43	199749	In_spite of the hundred things he had on his mind , Winston went and put his arm around her waist . 
9447	br-k28	15	44	199770	`` We 've got plenty of time to think_about that . 
9448	br-k28	15	45	199781	All the time in_the_world . 
9449	br-k28	15	46	199786	We 've only been married four years , January '' . 
9450	br-k28	16	47	199797	`` Four years '' ! she wailed . 
9451	br-k28	16	48	199805	`` That 's a long_time , waiting '' . 
9452	br-k28	17	49	199814	`` How many times have I told you '' - he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off - `` Too many times '' ! 
9453	br-k28	17	50	199843	- and flounced to the sink , where she began noisily to wash her hands . 
9454	br-k28	18	51	199859	Too many times was the truth of_it , Winston thought . 
9455	br-k28	18	52	199870	He hardly believed his reason himself any_more . 
9456	br-k28	18	53	199878	Although it had seemed a good reason , to_begin_with : no couple could afford to have children . 
9457	br-k28	19	54	199896	`` How you going to work with a child hanging_on you '' ? 
9458	br-k28	19	55	199909	he asked Leona . 
9459	br-k28	19	56	199913	`` You want to keep this job , do n't you '' ? 
9460	br-k28	19	57	199926	He doubted whether she heard him , over the running water . 
9461	br-k28	20	58	199938	He sat for_a_while with his hands on his knees , watching the bend of her back as she gathered_up her things - a comb , a bottle of aspirin - to take upstairs and pack . 
9462	br-k28	20	59	199974	She made him sad some days , and he was never sure why ; it was something to do with her back , the thinness of_it , and the quick , jerky way she bent . 
9463	br-k28	20	60	200010	She was too young , that was all ; too young and thin and straight . 
9464	br-k28	21	61	200026	`` Winston '' ! 
9465	br-k28	22	62	200030	It was Mr._Jack , bellowing out in the hall . 
9466	br-k28	22	63	200040	Winston hurried through the swinging_door . 
9467	br-k28	22	64	200046	`` I 've been bursting my lungs for you '' , Mr._Jack complained . 
9468	br-k28	22	65	200060	He was standing in_front_of the mirror , tightening his tie . 
9469	br-k28	22	66	200071	He had_on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat , and his brief_case lay on the bench . 
9470	br-k28	22	67	200090	`` I do n't know what you think you 've been doing about my clothes '' , he said . 
9471	br-k28	22	68	200110	`` This coat looks_like a rag heap '' . 
9472	br-k28	23	69	200119	There were a_few blades of lint on the shoulder . 
9473	br-k28	23	70	200129	Winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work . 
9474	br-k28	23	71	200142	He gave Mr._Jack a real going_over ; he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long , firm strokes . 
9475	br-k28	23	72	200165	`` Hey '' ! 
9476	br-k28	23	73	200169	Mr._Jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes . 
9477	br-k28	24	74	200182	Winston apologized and quickly set the hat right . 
9478	br-k28	24	75	200191	Then he stood_back to look at Mr._Jack , who was pulling on his pigskin gloves . 
9479	br-k28	24	76	200207	Winston enjoyed seeing him start_out ; he wore his clothes with style . 
9480	br-k28	24	77	200220	When he was going_to town , nothing was good enough - he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace . 
9481	br-k28	24	78	200247	At home , he would n't even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys . 
9482	br-k28	24	79	200274	The velvet smoking_jackets , pearl gray , wine , and blue , which Miss_Ada had bought him hung brushed and unworn in the closet . 
9483	br-k28	25	80	200299	`` Good-by , Winston '' , Mr._Jack said , giving a final set to his hat . 
9484	br-k28	25	81	200316	`` Look_out for those movers '' ! 
9485	br-k28	25	82	200323	Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car ; a handsome , fine-looking man it made him proud to see . 
9486	br-k28	26	83	200346	After Mr._Jack drove away , Winston went_on looking out the window . 
9487	br-k28	26	84	200358	He noticed a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger . 
9488	br-k28	26	85	200375	Then he looked at his finger , at the wrinkled , heavy knuckle and the thick nail he used like a knife to pry up , slit , and open . 
9489	br-k28	26	86	200406	For_the_first_time , he let himself be sad about the move . 
9490	br-k28	26	87	200417	That house was ten years off his life . 
9491	br-k28	26	88	200426	Each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward , and he knew how to get_at the dust in the china flowers and how to take_down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier . 
9492	br-k28	26	89	200462	He knew the house like a blind_man , through his fingers , and he did not like to think_of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up . 
9493	br-k28	27	90	200496	Ten years ago , he had come to the house to be interviewed . 
9494	br-k28	27	91	200510	The tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing . 
9495	br-k28	27	92	200535	Miss_Ada had been out back , in a straw_hat , planting flowers . 
9496	br-k28	27	93	200548	She had talked to him right there , with the hot sun in his face , which made him sweat and feel ashamed . 
9497	br-k28	27	94	200572	Winston had been surprised at her for that . 
9498	br-k28	27	95	200581	Still , he had liked the way she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton dress - citron yellow , if he remembered . 
9499	br-k28	27	96	200607	She had had a dignity about her , even barefoot and almost too tan . 
9500	br-k28	28	97	200622	Since then , the flowers she had planted had spread all_over the hill . 
9501	br-k28	28	98	200636	Already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front gate , and the periwinkles were coming_on , blue by the porch steps . 
9502	br-k28	28	99	200661	In a week the hyacinths would spike_out . 
9503	br-k28	28	100	200669	And the dogwood in early May , for Miss_Ada 's alfresco party ; and after that the Japanese_cherries . 
9504	br-k28	28	101	200688	Now the yard looked wet and bald , the trees bare under their buds , but in a while Miss_Ada 's flowers would bloom like a marching parade . 
9505	br-k28	28	102	200717	She had dug a hole for each bulb , each tree wore a tag with her writing on_it ; where would she go for her gardening now ? 
9506	br-k28	28	103	200745	Somehow Winston did n't think she 'd take_to window_boxes . 
9507	br-k28	29	104	200755	Sighing , he hurried to the living_room . 
9508	br-k28	29	105	200763	He had a_thousand things to see to . 
9509	br-k28	29	106	200771	Still , he could n't help thinking , we 're all getting old , getting small ; the snail is pulling_in her horns . 
9510	br-k28	30	107	200795	In the living_room , Miss_Ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in her hand . 
9511	br-k28	30	108	200814	She was looking out at the garden . 
9512	br-k28	31	109	200822	`` Winston '' , she said , `` get the basket for the breakables '' . 
9513	br-k28	32	110	200838	Winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall . 
9514	br-k28	32	111	200849	He brought it in and put it down beside her . 
9515	br-k28	32	112	200860	Miss_Ada was looking fine ; she had_on her Easter suit , blue , with lavender binding . 
9516	br-k28	32	113	200877	Halfway across the house , he could have smelled her morning perfume . 
9517	br-k28	32	114	200890	It hung_in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; sometimes when he was pressing , Winston raised her dresses to his face . 
9518	br-k28	33	115	200915	Frowning , Miss_Ada studied the list . 
9519	br-k28	33	116	200922	`` Well , let 's see . 
9520	br-k28	33	117	200929	The china lemon_tree . 
9521	br-k28	33	118	200933	The alabaster cockatoo '' . 
9522	br-k28	33	119	200938	Winston followed her around the room , collecting the small frail objects ( Christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and wrapping them in tissue_paper . 
9523	br-k28	33	120	200964	Neither of them trusted the movers . 
9524	br-k28	34	121	200971	When they came to Mr._Jack 's photograph , twenty by twelve inches in a curly silver frame , Miss_Ada said , `` By_rights I ought to leave that , seeing he won n't take my clotheshorse '' . 
9525	br-k28	34	122	201009	She smiled at Winston , and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes . 
9526	br-k28	34	123	201025	He picked_up the photograph and began to wrap it . 
9527	br-k28	35	124	201035	`` At_least you could leave it for the movers '' , Miss_Ada said . 
9528	br-k28	35	125	201049	`` What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea '' ? 
9529	br-k28	36	126	201065	Winston folded the tissue_paper carefully . 
9530	br-k28	36	127	201071	`` He 's used it every_day ; every morning , I lay_out his clothes on_it '' . 
9531	br-k28	37	128	201088	`` Well , that 's over now . 
9532	br-k28	37	129	201096	And it was his main present ! 
9533	br-k28	37	130	201103	Leave that fool picture out '' , she added sharply . 
9534	br-k28	38	131	201114	Winston laid it in the basket . 
9535	br-k28	38	132	201121	`` Mr._Jack sets store by that '' . 
9536	br-k28	39	133	201129	`` Really , Winston . 
9537	br-k28	39	134	201134	It was meant to be my present '' . 
9538	br-k28	39	135	201143	But she went_on down the list . 
9539	br-k28	40	136	201150	Winston was relieved ; those presents had been on his mind . 
9540	br-k28	40	137	201162	He had only agreed with Miss_Ada about getting the valet , but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr._Jack . 
9541	br-k28	40	138	201183	`` You know what she likes , Winston '' , he had said wearily , one evening in November when Winston was pulling_off his overshoes . 
9542	br-k28	40	139	201209	`` Tell me what to get her for Christmas '' . 
9543	br-k28	41	140	201220	`` She 's been talking_about a picture '' , Winston had told him . 
9544	br-k28	42	141	201234	`` Picture ! 
9545	br-k28	42	142	201237	You mean picture of me '' ? 
9546	br-k28	42	143	201244	But Winston had persuaded him . 
9547	br-k28	43	144	201250	On Christmas night , they had had a disagreement about it . 
9548	br-k28	43	145	201262	Winston had heard because he was setting_up the liquor tray in the next room . 
9549	br-k28	43	146	201277	Through the door , he had seen Mr._Jack walking_around , waiting for Miss_Ada . 
9550	br-k28	43	147	201291	Finally she had come_down ; Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown . 
9551	br-k28	44	148	201312	`` How do you like it '' ? she had asked . 
9552	br-k28	45	149	201324	Mr._Jack had said , `` You look about fifteen years old '' . 
9553	br-k28	46	150	201337	`` Is that a compliment '' ? 
9554	br-k28	47	151	201344	`` I do n't know '' . 
9555	br-k28	47	152	201351	He had stood at a_little distance , studying her , as though he would walk_around next and look at the back of her head . 
9556	br-k28	48	153	201376	`` Lovie , you make me feel naked '' . 
9557	br-k28	48	154	201386	Miss_Ada had giggled , and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and sank down . 
9558	br-k28	49	155	201403	`` You look like that picture I have at the office '' , Mr._Jack had started . 
9559	br-k28	49	156	201420	`` Not a line , not a wrinkle . 
9560	br-k28	49	157	201429	I look_like an old_man , compared '' , and he had picked_up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still on_it . 
9561	br-k28	49	158	201451	`` Look , an old_man . 
9562	br-k28	49	159	201457	Will you wear pink when you 're sixty '' ? 
9563	br-k28	50	160	201467	`` Darling , I love that photograph . 
9564	br-k28	50	161	201475	I'm going_to put it on my dresser '' . 
9565	br-k28	51	162	201484	`` I guess it 's children make a woman old . 
9566	br-k28	51	163	201495	A man gets old anyhow '' . 
9567	br-k28	51	164	201502	After a minute he went_on , `` People must think the curse is on me , seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray '' . 
9568	br-k28	52	165	201531	`` I 'll give you a medical certificate , framed , if you like '' , Miss_Ada had said . 
9569	br-k28	53	166	201551	`` No . 
9570	br-k28	53	167	201554	All I want is a picture - with a_few lines . 
9571	br-k28	53	168	201565	Make the man put them in if he has to '' . 
9572	br-k28	54	169	201577	After that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word . 
9573	br-k28	54	170	201590	Then Miss_Ada had stood_up , rustling and rustling , and gone upstairs . 
9574	br-k29	1	1	201603	Was it love ? 
9575	br-k29	1	2	201607	I had no_doubt that it was . 
9576	br-k29	1	3	201614	During the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster_casts and spatter prints of Catskill flowers and leaves was all_but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served_up to me for contemplation and delight . 
9577	br-k29	2	4	201655	Nothing in_all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world . 
9578	br-k29	2	5	201708	In final separation from them , in the railroad_terminal across the river from New_York , I would nearly cry . 
9579	br-k29	2	6	201728	My parents ' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted . 
9580	br-k29	2	7	201741	But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or mess-hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond . 
9581	br-k29	3	8	201816	These letters became the center of my existence . 
9582	br-k29	3	9	201825	I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . 
9583	br-k29	3	10	201861	My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and_others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commencing again her piano_lessons , her private_school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe . 
9584	br-k29	4	11	201961	In my letters I took_on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real_life . 
9585	br-k29	4	12	201978	Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after_school class I was enrolled . 
9586	br-k29	4	13	202027	The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young_man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot_Sands - he of the porch steps anecdotes - who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked_off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them . 
9587	br-k29	4	14	202086	Like Eliot , in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night 's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love . 
9588	br-k29	4	15	202160	The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle - it must have been late in September - I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and bloody , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life . 
9589	br-k29	4	16	202219	For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in_that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie_awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep . 
9590	br-k29	5	17	202268	The weeks went_by , and the longer our separation grew , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became . 
9591	br-k29	5	18	202289	They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer and at_the_same_time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again . 
9592	br-k29	6	19	202325	As it turned_out , Jessica took matters into her own hands . 
9593	br-k29	6	20	202337	Having received permission to give a camp reunion Halloween party , she asked that I come and be her date . 
9594	br-k29	6	21	202358	I went and , mum and nervous , all_but made a fool of myself . 
9595	br-k29	6	22	202373	Again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates , I was shy with Jessie and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing_for_effect , to be detached and unconcerned with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom , later , in the privacy of our bunks , we would think in_terms_of the most elaborate romance . 
9596	br-k29	6	23	202438	I remember standing in a corner , watching Jessica act the hostess , serving soft_drinks to her guests . 
9597	br-k29	6	24	202457	She was wearing her dark hair in two , thick braids to attain an `` American_Girl '' effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween . 
9598	br-k29	6	25	202482	It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it . 
9599	br-k29	6	26	202508	Yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter_writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality . 
9600	br-k29	6	27	202540	It was late , we were playing kissing games , and Jessica and I called_on to kiss in_front_of the others . 
9601	br-k29	6	28	202561	We blushed and were flustered , and it turned_out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek . 
9602	br-k29	6	29	202580	The kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote , exciting premonitions of lust , all the mysterious sensations that I had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me . 
9603	br-k29	7	30	202621	It was at that party that , finally overcoming my timidity , inspired by tales only half understood and overheard among older boys , I asked Jessie to spend New_Year's_Eve with me . 
9604	br-k29	7	31	202654	Lovingly , she accepted , and so great was my emotion that all I could think_of saying was , `` You 're amazing , you_know '' ? 
9605	br-k29	7	32	202681	Later , we agreed to think_of how we wished to spend that night . 
9606	br-k29	7	33	202695	We would write to one another and make a definite plan . 
9607	br-k29	7	34	202707	She was terribly pleased . 
9608	br-k29	8	35	202712	Among my school and neighborhood friends , during the next months , I bragged and swaggered and pompously described my impending date . 
9609	br-k29	8	36	202735	But though I boasted and gave_off a dapper front , I was beneath_it_all frightened . 
9610	br-k29	8	37	202750	It would be the first time I had ever been completely alone with a girl I loved . 
9611	br-k29	8	38	202768	I had no idea of_what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl , or how one behaved : 
9612	br-k29	8	39	202787	Should I hold her hand while walking or only when crossing the street ? 
9613	br-k29	8	40	202801	Should I bring along a corsage or send one to her ? 
9614	br-k29	8	41	202813	Was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city ? 
9615	br-k29	8	42	202826	Should I accompany her to the door of her home , or should I ask to be invited in ? 
9616	br-k29	8	43	202846	In or out , should I kiss her good-night ? 
9617	br-k29	8	44	202856	All this was unknown to me , and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year ! 
9618	br-k29	9	45	202881	When in one letter Jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going_out alone on New_Year's_Eve , I knew for a moment an immense relief ; but the letter went_on : she had cried , she had implored , she had been miserable at his refusal , and finally he had relented - and now how happy she was , how expectant ! 
9619	br-k29	10	46	202949	Her optimism gave me heart . 
9620	br-k29	10	47	202955	I forced confidence into myself . 
9621	br-k29	10	48	202961	I made inquiries , I read a book of etiquette . 
9622	br-k29	10	49	202972	In December I wrote her with_authority that we would meet on the steps of the Hotel_Astor , a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated . 
9623	br-k29	10	50	203001	We would attend a film and , later_on , I stated , we might go to the Mayflower_Coffee_Shop or Child 's or Toffenetti 's for waffles . 
9624	br-k29	10	51	203028	I set the hour of our meeting for seven . 
9625	br-k29	11	52	203038	At five o'clock that night it was already dark , and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a groom . 
9626	br-k29	11	53	203062	I wore a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels like a devil 's ears . 
9627	br-k29	11	54	203084	My camp made leather wallet , bulky with twisted , raised stitches around the edges , I stuffed with money I had been saving . 
9628	br-k29	11	55	203109	Hatless , in an overcoat of rough blue wool , I was given a proud farewell by my mother and father , and I set_out into the strangely still streets of Brooklyn . 
9629	br-k29	11	56	203142	I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving_behind , felt older than my years , and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of_that dull borough and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement of Manhattan . 
9630	br-k29	12	57	203193	Times_Square , when I ascended to_it with my fellow subway travellers ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly impassable , the sidewalks swarming_with celebrants , with bundled_up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey . 
9631	br-k29	12	58	203250	Heavy_coated , severe looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling_out in_front of the crawling traffic . 
9632	br-k29	12	59	203274	The night was cold but the crowd kept one warm . 
9633	br-k29	12	60	203285	The giant electric signs and marquees were lit_up for_the_first_time since blackout regulations had been instituted , and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around_the_corner . 
9634	br-k29	12	61	203315	Cardboard noisemakers , substitutes for the unavailable tin models , were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards along Broadway , and one 's ears were continually serenaded by the horns ' rasps and bleats . 
9635	br-k29	12	62	203354	An old gentlemen next to me held a Boy_Scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at every fourth step and during the interim shouted_out , `` V for Victory '' ! 
9636	br-k29	12	63	203386	His neighbors cheered him on . 
9637	br-k29	12	64	203392	There was a great sense of camaraderie . 
9638	br-k29	12	65	203400	How did one join them ? 
9639	br-k29	12	66	203406	Where were they all walking to ? 
9640	br-k29	12	67	203413	Was I supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica ? 
9641	br-k29	13	68	203427	It was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed_me_up among the other gallants who had established the Astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking . 
9642	br-k29	13	69	203459	I looked over their faces and felt a twinge : they all looked so much more knowing than I . 
9643	br-k29	13	70	203479	I looked_away . 
9644	br-k29	13	71	203482	I looked_for Jessica to materialize out of the clogging , curdling crowd and , as the time passed and I waited , a fiend came_to_life beside me and whispered in my ear : How was I planning to greet Jessica ? 
9645	br-k29	13	72	203523	Where exactly would we go after the movie ? 
9646	br-k29	13	73	203532	Suppose the lines in_front_of the movie_houses were too long and we could n't get_in ? 
9647	br-k29	13	74	203547	Suppose I had n't brought along enough money ? 
9648	br-k29	13	75	203556	I felt for my wallet . 
9649	br-k29	13	76	203562	Its thick , substantial outline calmed me . 
9650	br-k29	14	77	203570	But when I saw that it was already ten past seven , I began to wonder if something had gone_wrong . 
9651	br-k29	14	78	203591	Suppose her father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave ? 
9652	br-k29	14	79	203606	Suppose at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans ? 
9653	br-k29	14	80	203625	I grew uneasy . 
9654	br-k29	14	81	203629	All about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings taking_place , like abrupt , jerky scenes in old silent_movies , joyous greetings and beginnings , huggings and kissings , enthusiastic forays into the festive night . 
9655	br-k29	14	82	203666	Whole platoons were taking_up new positions on the steps , arriving and departing , while I stayed glued , like a signpost , to one spot . 
9656	br-k29	15	83	203693	At 7 : 25 two hotel doormen came thumping down the steps , carrying a saw-horse to be set_up as a barricade in_front_of the haberdashery_store window next to the entranceway , and as I watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground , their golden , fringed epaulets and spic , red visored caps , I suddenly saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd . 
9657	br-k29	15	84	203768	My heart almost stopped beating . 
9658	br-l11	1	1	203774	`` Right '' , said the fingerprint_man . 
9659	br-l11	1	2	203782	`` Also , if you 're going_to believe those prints , you 'll have to look_for a killer who 's a top-grade piano_player '' . 
9660	br-l11	2	3	203807	He demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano , doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack . 
9661	br-l11	2	4	203825	To make it clearer he shifted to acting_out , but with no change of manner , the killing of Rose_Mallory . 
9662	br-l11	2	5	203846	His hands snatched at an imaginary bucket , swooping down hard to grab it and coming_away with equal snap like a ball that 's been bounced hard . 
9663	br-l11	2	6	203874	In the same way he pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that , pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that . 
9664	br-l11	2	7	203901	He was moving like a ballet_dancer , playing for laughs . 
9665	br-l11	2	8	203912	If Rose_Mallory 's killer acted this way , catching_up_with him was going_to be a cinch . 
9666	br-l11	2	9	203928	We 'd know him by his stretch_pants and the flowers he 'd wear twined in his hair . 
9667	br-l11	3	10	203946	Perhaps if Felix had first come_upon us when this boy was not cavorting so gaily up_and_down the hall outside the murdered woman 's apartment , we might have had less trouble convincing Felix of our seriousness . 
9668	br-l11	3	11	203983	This , you will remember , was still New_Year's_Day . 
9669	br-l11	3	12	203993	By the time Felix turned_up it was early afternoon , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by then , except for small children and a_few hardy souls who had not_yet sobered_up , it could have been expected that people would no_longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night 's noisemakers and paper hats . 
9670	br-l11	4	13	204057	Felix was the exception . 
9671	br-l11	4	14	204062	He had retained his hat and his horn , and , whatever fun might still be going , he was ready to join it . 
9672	br-l11	4	15	204087	That , incidentally , might give you some idea of what Felix was like . 
9673	br-l11	4	16	204102	After_all , he had n't happened_upon us in_that second floor hall without warning . 
9674	br-l11	5	17	204116	The ME 's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination and the body had been removed for autopsy . 
9675	br-l11	5	18	204134	The meat wagon , therefore , was not out in_front of the house any_more , but the cluster of squad_cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings . 
9676	br-l11	5	19	204173	There was , furthermore , the crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance . 
9677	br-l11	6	20	204200	Just put yourself in Felix 's place for a moment . 
9678	br-l11	6	21	204211	You 're a taxpayer , householder , landlord . 
9679	br-l11	6	22	204220	You 've been away from home for the New_Year festivities , but now the party is over and you come home . 
9680	br-l11	6	23	204242	Defining sobriety in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol ingested and not_yet eliminated from the system , you are sober . 
9681	br-l11	7	24	204272	You still have your paper hat and you 're wearing it , but then , it is an extraordinary paper hat and , in_addition to anything else you may be , you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame out in the back_yard . 
9682	br-l11	7	25	204319	It 's not too_much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr._Average_Citizen . 
9683	br-l11	8	26	204340	You have your paper horn clutched in your big , craggy fist , and for your entrance you have planned a noisy , colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and tenants . 
9684	br-l11	8	27	204373	You find your house a focus of public and police attention . 
9685	br-l11	8	28	204385	Can you imagine yourself forgetting under_the_circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn ? 
9686	br-l11	9	29	204410	Maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness . 
9687	br-l11	9	30	204418	You shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door . 
9688	br-l11	9	31	204439	You identify yourself and ask him what 's going_on . 
9689	br-l11	9	32	204449	Instead of answering you , he sticks his head in the door and shouts up_the_stairs . 
9690	br-l11	10	33	204465	`` Got the upstairs guy '' , he bellows . 
9691	br-l11	10	34	204475	`` The owner . 
9692	br-l11	10	35	204479	Do I send him up '' ? 
9693	br-l11	10	36	204486	Then he turns_back to you . 
9694	br-l11	10	37	204492	`` Go_on in '' , he says . 
9695	br-l11	10	38	204500	`` They 'll tell you what 's cooking '' . 
9696	br-l11	11	39	204510	Even then , as you go_into the house oppressed by the knowledge that something_is_cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable , official control , could you go_on forgetting that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand ? 
9697	br-l11	12	40	204563	What I'm getting at is that we were fully prepared for Felix 's being an odd one . 
9698	br-l11	12	41	204581	We 'd seen his handiwork out in the back_yard , and the little his tenants had told us of him did make him sound a_little special . 
9699	br-l11	12	42	204608	We were not , however , prepared_for anything like the apparition that confronted us as Felix came_up the stairs . 
9700	br-l11	12	43	204628	He , of_course , must have been equally unprepared for what confronted him , but , nonetheless , I did find his reaction startling . 
9701	br-l11	13	44	204653	If Felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn because he 'd forgotten about them , he now remembered . 
9702	br-l11	13	45	204675	He came bounding up_the_stairs and joined the dance . 
9703	br-l11	13	46	204684	He adjusted the hat , lifted the horn to his lips as_though it were a flute , and fell_in alongside our fingerprint_expert to cavort with him . 
9704	br-l11	14	47	204711	Our man stopped_dead and glowered at Felix . 
9705	br-l11	14	48	204719	Felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house . 
9706	br-l11	14	49	204740	This was a bull of a man . 
9707	br-l11	14	50	204748	He was big_chested , big-shouldered and heavy-armed . 
9708	br-l11	14	51	204756	His face was ruddy and heavy and unlined , and when he laughed he showed his teeth , which were big and white and strong and unquestionably home-grown . 
9709	br-l11	14	52	204785	I do n't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at_the_same_time quite so emphatically not dentures . 
9710	br-l11	14	53	204805	His hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck . 
9711	br-l11	14	54	204820	He had only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short . 
9712	br-l11	14	55	204834	It was almost as white as his teeth . 
9713	br-l11	14	56	204843	For a man of his mass he was curiously short . 
9714	br-l11	14	57	204854	He was n't a dwarf but he was a_bit of a comic figure . 
9715	br-l11	14	58	204868	A man with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand taller than five feet five . 
9716	br-l11	14	59	204895	For Felix it was a_bit of a stretch to make even that measurement . 
9717	br-l11	14	60	204909	The man was just this side of being a freak . 
9718	br-l11	15	61	204920	We waited till he had finished laughing , and that gave us a_few moments for taking_stock of him . 
9719	br-l11	15	62	204939	He was dressed in a manner Esquire might suggest for the outdoor_man 's country weekend . 
9720	br-l11	15	63	204955	Dark gray sports_jacket , lighter gray slacks , pink flannel shirt , black silk necktie . 
9721	br-l11	15	64	204971	His eyes were clear . 
9722	br-l11	15	65	204976	He was freshly shaved , and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have missed detecting some scent of_it on the massive gusts of his laughter . 
9723	br-l11	15	66	205007	Not even a whiff . 
9724	br-l11	15	67	205012	Eventually he subsided . 
9725	br-l11	16	68	205016	`` Felix '' ? 
9726	br-l11	16	69	205020	Gibby said . 
9727	br-l11	17	70	205023	`` Me '' , he said merrily . 
9728	br-l11	17	71	205031	`` Me , the happy one '' . 
9729	br-l11	18	72	205039	`` That_much Latin we remember '' , Gibby said dryly . 
9730	br-l11	18	73	205050	`` You always live_up_to your name , always like this , always making_happy '' ? 
9731	br-l11	19	74	205065	`` I try '' , Felix said blithely . 
9732	br-l11	19	75	205074	`` The world is full of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene . 
9733	br-l11	19	76	205091	I 've never noticed that it improves things any '' . 
9734	br-l11	20	77	205102	`` Bully for you '' , Gibby said . 
9735	br-l11	20	78	205111	`` What 's the rest of your name '' ? 
9736	br-l11	21	79	205121	`` No rest of_it . 
9737	br-l11	21	80	205126	Felix is all there is '' . 
9738	br-l11	22	81	205133	`` All there ever was '' ? 
9739	br-l11	23	82	205140	`` The past I leave to historians '' , Felix intoned , demonstrating that he could be pompous as_well_as happy . 
9740	br-l11	24	83	205161	`` You live in the present '' ? 
9741	br-l11	25	84	205169	`` In the present '' , Felix proclaimed . 
9742	br-l11	25	85	205178	`` For the future . 
9743	br-l11	25	86	205183	Is there any other time in which a man can live '' ? 
9744	br-l11	26	87	205196	`` We '' , Gibby announced , `` are not philosophers . 
9745	br-l11	26	88	205208	We are Assistant_District_Attorneys . 
9746	br-l11	26	89	205212	This gentleman is a police_officer . 
9747	br-l11	26	90	205218	He is a fingerprint_specialist . 
9748	br-l11	26	91	205223	Could your future , your immediate future , be made to include taking us upstairs , giving us a_bit of space in which our friend can work , and making available to him your finger_tips '' ? 
9749	br-l11	27	92	205260	The happy one could never have looked happier . 
9750	br-l11	27	93	205269	This was more_than joy . 
9751	br-l11	27	94	205274	It was ecstasy . 
9752	br-l11	28	95	205278	`` Those lovely whorls '' , he chortled . 
9753	br-l11	28	96	205287	`` So intricate , so beautiful . 
9754	br-l11	28	97	205294	Come_right_along . 
9755	br-l11	28	98	205296	I love fingerprints '' . 
9756	br-l11	29	99	205301	He was prancing along the hall , heading for the next flight_of_stairs . 
9757	br-l11	30	100	205314	Gibby called him back . 
9758	br-l11	30	101	205319	`` We 're here because of_what happened last night '' , he said . 
9759	br-l11	30	102	205333	`` Past , yes , but important . 
9760	br-l11	30	103	205341	Since it is important , for the record let 's have the full name '' . 
9761	br-l11	31	104	205357	`` That important '' ? 
9762	br-l11	31	105	205362	Felix asked . 
9763	br-l11	32	106	205365	`` That important '' . 
9764	br-l11	33	107	205370	`` Grubb '' , Felix whispered . 
9765	br-l11	34	108	205377	`` Felix_Grubb '' ? 
9766	br-l11	34	109	205381	Gibby asked , not bothering to whisper . 
9767	br-l11	35	110	205389	`` Shh '' , Felix implored . 
9768	br-l11	35	111	205396	`` I can n't see what would make it necessary for you to know . 
9769	br-l11	35	112	205411	Nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world '' . 
9770	br-l11	36	113	205425	Obligingly Gibby lowered his voice . 
9771	br-l11	36	114	205431	`` Felix_Grubb '' ? 
9772	br-l11	36	115	205435	he repeated . 
9773	br-l11	36	116	205438	`` No . 
9774	br-l11	36	117	205441	Edmund , but not for years . 
9775	br-l11	36	118	205448	For years it 's been just Felix . 
9776	br-l11	36	119	205456	First thing I did after my twenty-first birthday was go_into court and have it officially changed , and this is something I do n't tell everybody . 
9777	br-l11	36	120	205483	That was almost forty years ago '' . 
9778	br-l11	37	121	205491	Having volunteered that he was a man of about sixty , he bounded up_the_stairs and with each leap rendered the number less credible . 
9779	br-l11	37	122	205515	This was a broth_of_a_boy , our Felix , and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice and spirit . 
9780	br-l11	37	123	205547	We followed him up_the_stairs . 
9781	br-l11	37	124	205552	The cops would gather_up Connor and the foursome on the third floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting . 
9782	br-l11	38	125	205577	You may think we did n't need Nancy and Jean , but you always get what you can when you can , and we had no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them could n't be useful before we were through_with this case . 
9783	br-l11	38	126	205621	Also , if we had excluded the ladies we would have_to that extent let the whole world know at_least that much of where we stood . 
9784	br-l11	38	127	205647	The killer , if in our present group , would certainly be interested in knowing that much , and even_though with the fingerprint evidence what it was I could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation , there might always be some way . 
9785	br-l11	38	128	205699	If you can possibly avoid it , you do n't hand_out any extra chances . 
9786	br-l11	39	129	205714	Felix took us into his studio . 
9787	br-l11	39	130	205721	It was that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house , where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope . 
9788	br-l11	39	131	205750	At each angle of its pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades . 
9789	br-l11	40	132	205779	When Felix first opened the door on_it , all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night . 
9790	br-l11	40	133	205803	He quickly fixed that , rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens on the others . 
9791	br-l11	40	134	205824	He flew about the place making these adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience . 
9792	br-l11	40	135	205848	None of his movements was tentative . 
9793	br-l11	40	136	205855	There was no process of trial_and_error . 
9794	br-l11	40	137	205862	Starting with the room completely blacked_out , as it was when we came_in , he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting even so much as a crack of glare . 
9795	br-l11	41	138	205906	Expecting something more-than average wacky , I was surprised by what we found . 
9796	br-l11	41	139	205920	There was no display of either works_in_progress or of finished work . 
9797	br-l11	41	140	205932	Here_and_there on work_table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped over it . 
9798	br-l11	41	141	205950	These shapes might have been mad , but there was no telling . 
9799	br-l11	41	142	205963	They were all completely shrouded . 
9800	br-l11	41	143	205969	The equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition . 
9801	br-l11	41	144	205980	Everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the workman 's comfort , convenience and efficiency . 
9802	br-l11	41	145	205999	There were tools about but they were neatly kept . 
9803	br-l11	41	146	206009	There was no confusion and no litter . 
9804	br-l11	41	147	206017	Supplies of sheet_metal were neatly stacked in bins . 
9805	br-l12	1	1	206026	Andy did not see the newspapers the next day . 
9806	br-l12	1	2	206036	Someone on his staff - he suspected it was Ed_Thornburg - intercepted them and for this Andy was grateful . 
9807	br-l12	2	3	206056	He finally fell_asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping_capsule , a crutch he rarely used , and did n't awaken until early afternoon . 
9808	br-l12	2	4	206085	Memory flooded him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach . 
9809	br-l12	3	5	206102	Outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day . 
9810	br-l12	3	6	206111	Presumably the same sun was shining upon little Drew also , and those who had kidnapped him . 
9811	br-l12	3	7	206129	But where ? 
9812	br-l12	3	8	206132	It was still a very big world , despite all the modern cant to_the_contrary . 
9813	br-l12	4	9	206147	Hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door . 
9814	br-l12	4	10	206159	He was dozing , perhaps the only sleep he 'd gotten . 
9815	br-l12	4	11	206171	He snapped to alertness at Andy 's entrance . 
9816	br-l12	4	12	206180	`` Sorry , Mr._Paxton . 
9817	br-l12	4	13	206185	Nothing new . 
9818	br-l12	4	14	206188	Lot of people waiting to see you , though '' . 
9819	br-l12	5	15	206199	`` Reporters '' ? 
9820	br-l12	6	16	206203	`` Our own people . 
9821	br-l12	6	17	206208	Questions about the show tonight '' . 
9822	br-l12	6	18	206215	Hub picked_up the telephone . 
9823	br-l12	6	19	206220	`` Shall I let them know you 're awake '' ? 
9824	br-l12	7	20	206231	`` I suppose . 
9825	br-l12	7	21	206235	How 's Lissa , do you know '' ? 
9826	br-l12	8	22	206244	Hub considered . 
9827	br-l12	8	23	206247	`` Some better . 
9828	br-l12	8	24	206251	She 's got plenty of guts , Mr._Paxton . 
9829	br-l12	8	25	206260	You want me to call her '' ? 
9830	br-l12	9	26	206268	`` She expecting me to '' ? 
9831	br-l12	9	27	206275	Hub shook his head so Andy told him not to bother . 
9832	br-l12	9	28	206287	The only reason for contacting Lissa was to comfort or to be comforted . 
9833	br-l12	9	29	206301	He could not manage the former or expect the latter ; they had nothing to give to each other . 
9834	br-l12	9	30	206321	The omission might look peculiar to outsiders , but Andy could not bring himself to go_through_the_motions simply for the sake of appearances . 
9835	br-l12	10	31	206344	He had little time to himself , anyway . 
9836	br-l12	10	32	206353	As the afternoon sped toward evening , the suite saw a steady procession of Paxton aides pass in and out , each with his own special problem . 
9837	br-l12	10	33	206381	Thornburg arrived with the writers . 
9838	br-l12	10	34	206387	They had spent the morning revising the act , eliminating all the gay songs , patter and dancing with a view of the best public_relations . 
9839	br-l12	10	35	206413	What remained lacked the original verve but it was at_least dignified , as befitting the tragic circumstances . 
9840	br-l12	10	36	206431	Raymond_Fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed `` Cradle_Song '' in_case it was needed . 
9841	br-l12	10	37	206447	Charlie_Marble was back_and_forth on several occasions , first to confer_with Andy on the advisability of cancelling the Las_Vegas engagement - they decided it was wise - and later to announce that a prominent comedian , also an agency client , had agreed to fill the casino 's open date . 
9842	br-l12	10	38	206497	And once Bake slipped in , pale and drawn , last night 's liquor still on his breath with some of today 's added to_it . 
9843	br-l12	10	39	206523	He asked if there was anything he could do . 
9844	br-l12	10	40	206533	Andy invented a job to keep him busy , sending him ahead to El_Dorado to supervise last_minute arrangements . 
9845	br-l12	11	41	206552	But from Rocco_Vecchio , they heard nothing . 
9846	br-l12	12	42	206560	At_last it was time to depart . 
9847	br-l12	12	43	206567	Hub , nosing about , spotted reporters in the lobby , so Andy was hustled away quietly through the hotel 's service_entrance in a strange car which Hub had procured somewhere . 
9848	br-l12	13	44	206599	They succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel , but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub . 
9849	br-l12	13	45	206621	El_Dorado was surrounded by a mob . 
9850	br-l12	13	46	206628	They overflowed the parking_lot , making progress by automobile difficult . 
9851	br-l12	13	47	206639	Long before he reached the protection of the stage_door , Andy was recognized . 
9852	br-l12	13	48	206653	Word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brush-fire . 
9853	br-l12	13	49	206665	They surged around him , fingers pointing , eyes prying . 
9854	br-l12	13	50	206676	It was not a hostile gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last night 's hero-worshippers . 
9855	br-l12	13	51	206693	They had come not to admire but to observe . 
9856	br-l12	14	52	206703	`` It 's worse inside '' , Thornburg informed Andy . 
9857	br-l12	14	53	206714	`` Skolman 's jammed in every table he could find . 
9858	br-l12	14	54	206725	Under the heading of_it 's an ill wind , et_cetera '' . 
9859	br-l12	15	55	206737	Backstage was tomb like by contrast . 
9860	br-l12	15	56	206744	Andy 's co-workers kept their distance , awed by the tragedy . 
9861	br-l12	15	57	206756	But in his dressing_room was a large bouquet and a card that read , `` We 're with you all_the_way '' . 
9862	br-l12	15	58	206778	It was signed by everyone in the troupe . 
9863	br-l12	15	59	206787	Andy could n't help but be touched . 
9864	br-l12	15	60	206795	He instructed Shirl_Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call_board . 
9865	br-l12	16	61	206811	Bake was waiting to report that Lou_DuVol had been sobered_up to the point where he could function efficiently . 
9866	br-l12	16	62	206830	Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment . 
9867	br-l12	16	63	206840	Bake himself looked better ; any kind of job was better than brooding . 
9868	br-l12	17	64	206854	Andy told him , `` Bake , I wish you 'd talk to Skolman , see if some kind of p._a._system can be rigged_up outside . 
9869	br-l12	17	65	206880	It 's just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper was n't able to get a table . 
9870	br-l12	17	66	206899	I would n't want him to miss the message '' . 
9871	br-l12	18	67	206910	`` I 'll try . 
9872	br-l12	18	68	206915	Skolman is n't going_to like it much , though , giving_away what he should be selling '' . 
9873	br-l12	19	69	206933	Skolman was n't the only one who did n't care_for Andy 's scheme . 
9874	br-l12	19	70	206947	A short time later , Lieutenant_Bonner stomped into the dressing_room . 
9875	br-l12	19	71	206958	`` I got_a_bone_to_pick with you , Mr._Paxton . 
9876	br-l12	19	72	206966	It 's those damn loudspeakers '' . 
9877	br-l12	20	73	206973	Andy rolled_up the revised script he had been studying . 
9878	br-l12	20	74	206983	`` What about them '' ? 
9879	br-l12	21	75	206989	`` They 're going_to louse me up good . 
9880	br-l12	21	76	206998	My men have been here all afternoon , setting_up for this thing '' . 
9881	br-l12	21	77	207012	Bonner explained that , with the nightclub 's cooperation , the police had occupied El_Dorado like a battlefield . 
9882	br-l12	21	78	207031	Motion_picture cameras had been installed to film the audience , the reservation list was being checked_out name by name , and a special detail was already at_work in the parking_lot scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead . 
9883	br-l12	21	79	207068	However , it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside , even if Bonner had manpower available for the purpose . 
9884	br-l12	21	80	207090	`` I want you to have the speakers taken_out '' . 
9885	br-l12	22	81	207101	Andy sighed . 
9886	br-l12	22	82	207104	`` Seems like we 're never going to see_eye_to_eye , Lieutenant . 
9887	br-l12	22	83	207116	Did n't they tell you what I wanted the p._a._system for '' ? 
9888	br-l12	23	84	207129	`` Sure , I know . 
9889	br-l12	23	85	207135	But it 's such a long_shot '' - 
9890	br-l12	24	86	207143	`` No longer than yours . 
9891	br-l12	24	87	207149	What do you expect to get tonight , anyway ? 
9892	br-l12	24	88	207159	You think somebody is going_to stand_up in the audience and make guilty faces ? 
9893	br-l12	24	89	207173	Or have a sign on his car that says , ' Here Comes the Paxton Kidnapper '' ' ? 
9894	br-l12	24	90	207192	Andy crumbled the script in his fist . 
9895	br-l12	24	91	207200	`` I can n't stop you from doing what you think is right . 
9896	br-l12	24	92	207214	But do n't try to stop me , either '' . 
9897	br-l12	25	93	207225	`` Someday '' , Bonner said , `` you 're going_to ask us for help . 
9898	br-l12	25	94	207241	I can hardly wait '' . 
9899	br-l12	26	95	207247	`` What you do n't understand is that I'm asking for it now '' . 
9900	br-l12	27	96	207262	But Bonner departed , still full of ill_will . 
9901	br-l12	27	97	207271	He had gotten stuck_with a job too big for his imagination ; he had to cling_to routine , tested procedures . 
9902	br-l12	27	98	207292	To act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness . 
9903	br-l12	27	99	207302	But , admit or not , Bonner was helpless . 
9904	br-l12	27	100	207312	The crime showed too much planning , the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist . 
9905	br-l12	28	101	207331	Andy 's performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock . 
9906	br-l12	28	102	207340	He stalled for a half-hour longer , hoping to hear something from Vecchio about the ransom_money . 
9907	br-l12	28	103	207357	Bake and Shirl_Winter , on separate telephones , could not reach him at any conceivable location in Los_Angeles , nor could they secure any clear-cut information regarding his efforts . 
9908	br-l12	29	104	207387	Bake cursed . 
9909	br-l12	29	105	207390	`` The sweaty bastard 's probably halfway to Peru with our money by now '' . 
9910	br-l12	29	106	207406	When no one smiled , he felt constrained to add , `` Just kidding , natch '' . 
9911	br-l12	30	107	207424	Thornburg popped_in to advise , `` Andy , Skolman 's sending_up_smoke_signals . 
9912	br-l12	30	108	207436	You about ready '' ? 
9913	br-l12	31	109	207441	`` What 's he complaining about '' ? 
9914	br-l12	31	110	207449	Bake asked . 
9915	br-l12	31	111	207452	`` They 're drinking , are n't they '' ? 
9916	br-l12	32	112	207462	`` No . 
9917	br-l12	32	113	207465	We got a bunch of sippers out there tonight . 
9918	br-l12	32	114	207475	I guess nobody wants to pass_out and miss anything '' . 
9919	br-l12	32	115	207486	Thornburg added in a lower voice but Andy overheard , `` They act more like a jury than an audience '' . 
9920	br-l12	33	116	207508	Andy said , `` Well , I guess we can n't wait any longer . 
9921	br-l12	33	117	207523	Hub , you stick by the stage_door . 
9922	br-l12	33	118	207531	If Rock shows_up during the number - or you hear anything - give me the signal '' . 
9923	br-l12	34	119	207549	Shirl_Winter said , `` I 'll stay on the phone , Mr._Paxton . 
9924	br-l12	34	120	207562	There 's a_couple_of call-backs I can work_on '' . 
9925	br-l12	35	121	207571	`` You 're a sweetheart - but leave one line open . 
9926	br-l12	35	122	207583	He may try to phone us '' . 
9927	br-l12	35	123	207591	Andy passed into the corridor , their `` good_lucks '' ! following him . 
9928	br-l12	35	124	207605	It was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different , as if he really needed it . 
9929	br-l12	36	125	207626	They were right . 
9930	br-l12	36	126	207630	The act , cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon , had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone . 
9931	br-l12	36	127	207652	The result had nothing of the polish , pace or cohesion of the previous night . 
9932	br-l12	36	128	207668	Here 's where luck would normally step_in . 
9933	br-l12	36	129	207676	But this was no ordinary show and Andy knew it . 
9934	br-l12	36	130	207687	Whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with_it . 
9935	br-l12	36	131	207699	The audience had come not to be entertained but to judge . 
9936	br-l12	36	132	207711	Twenty-four_hours had changed him from a performer to a freak . 
9937	br-l12	37	133	207722	Within this framework , what followed was strained , even macabre . 
9938	br-l12	37	134	207734	Eliminating the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy . 
9939	br-l12	37	135	207752	The effect was as depressing as a gravestone , the applause irresolute and short-lived . 
9940	br-l12	37	136	207767	Yet Andy plowed_ahead , mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning , and gradually his listeners warmed_to him . 
9941	br-l12	37	137	207789	Their clapping grew more fervent ; the evening was still not beyond salvaging , not as a show but for him as a person . 
9942	br-l12	38	138	207814	The worst was yet to come . 
9943	br-l12	39	139	207821	As Andy reached the finale of his act , a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings . 
9944	br-l12	39	140	207841	Rocco_Vecchio - a perspiring , haggard Vecchio - was standing there , flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored transport guards . 
9945	br-l12	39	141	207865	Vecchio was nodding and pointing at the large suitcase he held . 
9946	br-l12	40	142	207877	Andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief . 
9947	br-l12	40	143	207886	He waved at Fox to cut_off the finale introduction . 
9948	br-l12	40	144	207896	The music died_away discordantly . 
9949	br-l12	40	145	207901	He drew a deep breath . 
9950	br-l12	40	146	207907	`` Ladies and gentlemen , in_place_of my regular closing number tonight , I 'd like to sing something of a different nature for you . 
9951	br-l12	40	147	207932	Ray , if you please - the ' Cradle_Song '' ' . 
9952	br-l12	41	148	207944	He sensed rather_than heard the gasp that swept across the audience . 
9953	br-l12	41	149	207956	Nor could he blame them . 
9954	br-l12	41	150	207962	This particular song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste , callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency . 
9955	br-l12	41	151	207988	Having no choice , he plunged into it , anyway , holding onto the microphone for support . 
9956	br-l12	42	152	208006	`` Lullaby_and_goodnight '' . 
9957	br-l12	43	153	208010	voice shook . 
9958	br-l12	43	154	208013	For_the_first_time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway through and had to cover_up by humming the rest . 
9959	br-l12	43	155	208032	He wondered if the audience would let him finish . 
9960	br-l12	44	156	208042	They did ; though contemptuous , they were still polite . 
9961	br-l12	44	157	208053	But when he was finally through , their scorn was made apparent . 
9962	br-l12	44	158	208066	Someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped . 
9963	br-l12	44	159	208073	Otherwise , the silence was complete . 
9964	br-l12	44	160	208080	As the lights came_up , Andy could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward the exit . 
9965	br-l12	45	161	208102	He stumbled off-stage . 
9966	br-l12	45	162	208106	`` My_God '' , he muttered . 
9967	br-l12	45	163	208113	`` My_God '' . 
9968	br-l12	46	164	208117	Hub was there to support him . 
9969	br-l12	46	165	208124	`` It 's okay , Mr._Paxton . 
9970	br-l12	46	166	208131	The money 's here , all_of it '' . 
9971	br-l12	47	167	208140	At this moment , all he could think_of was what he 'd been forced to undergo . 
9972	br-l12	47	168	208157	`` Did you hear them ? 
9973	br-l12	47	169	208163	Do you know what they think_of me '' ? 
9974	br-l12	48	170	208172	`` Bunch of damn jerks '' , Hub growled . 
9975	br-l12	48	171	208182	`` Who needs them '' ? 
9976	br-l12	49	172	208188	Thornburg patted his arm . 
9977	br-l12	49	173	208193	`` Sure , Andy , it 'll be all_right . 
9978	br-l12	49	174	208203	Nothing broken that can n't be mended '' . 
9979	br-l12	49	175	208212	The words were hollow . 
9980	br-l12	49	176	208217	Thornburg knew , better than any of them , that a public image was as fragile as Humpty_Dumpty . 
9981	br-l12	49	177	208236	All the king 's horses and all the king 's men . 
9982	br-l12	50	178	208248	Vecchio shouldered_in . 
9983	br-l12	50	179	208251	`` I got_it , Andy . 
9984	br-l12	50	180	208257	God_knows_how , but I got_it . 
9985	br-l12	50	181	208263	You 'll never believe the places I 've been today . 
9986	br-l12	50	182	208274	I practically had to sign your life away , you 'll probably fire me for some of the deals I had to go_for , but '' - 
9987	br-l12	51	183	208301	Andy nodded dully . 
9988	br-l12	51	184	208305	`` It does n't matter , Rock . 
9989	br-l12	51	185	208313	We 've done our part '' . 
9990	br-l12	52	186	208320	He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing_room . 
9991	br-l12	52	187	208333	The usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent ; the place had the air of a morgue . 
9992	br-l12	52	188	208350	Andy had no desire to linger himself but Hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to disperse them . 
9993	br-m01	1	1	208377	Now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers , merge without let . 
9994	br-m01	1	2	208400	Self 's integrity was and is and ever had been . 
9995	br-m01	1	3	208411	Mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves , the many threes-fulfilled on Mars , corporate and discorporate , the precious few on Earth - the unknown powers of three on Earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at_last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself . 
9996	br-m01	2	4	208463	Mike remained in trance ; there was much to grok , loose_ends to puzzle_over and fit into his growing - all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel_Foster_Tabernacle ( not just cusp when he and Digby had come face_to_face alone ) - why Bishop_Senator_Boone made him warily uneasy , how Miss_Dawn_Ardent tasted like a water_brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping_up_and_down and wailing - 
9997	br-m01	3	5	208541	Jubal 's conversations coming and going - Jubal 's words troubled him most ; he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in . 
9998	br-m01	3	6	208592	The word `` church '' which turned_up over_and_over_again among Jubal 's words gave him knotty difficulty ; there was no Martian concept to match it - unless one took `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` God '' and `` congregation '' and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only world he had known during growing waiting & & & then forced the concept back into English in_that phrase which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by Jubal , by Mahmoud , by Digby . 
9999	br-m01	4	7	208686	`` Thou art God '' . 
10000	br-m01	4	8	208692	He was closer to understanding it in English now , although it could never have the inevitability of the Martian concept it stood_for . 
10001	br-m01	4	9	208716	In his mind he spoke simultaneously the English sentence and the Martian word and felt closer grokking . 
10002	br-m01	4	10	208734	Repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the lotus he sank into nirvana . 
10003	br-m01	5	11	208753	Before midnight he speeded his heart , resumed normal breathing , ran_down his check_list , uncurled and sat_up . 
10004	br-m01	5	12	208772	He had been weary ; now he felt light and gay and clear-headed , ready for the many actions he saw spreading_out before him . 
10005	br-m01	6	13	208797	He felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet . 
10006	br-m01	6	14	208813	He stepped_out into the hall , was delighted to encounter a water_brother . 
10007	br-m01	6	15	208826	`` Hi '' ! 
10008	br-m01	7	16	208830	`` Oh . 
10009	br-m01	7	17	208833	Hello , Mike . 
10010	br-m01	7	18	208837	My , you look chipper '' . 
10011	br-m01	8	19	208844	`` I feel fine ! 
10012	br-m01	8	20	208849	Where is everybody '' ? 
10013	br-m01	9	21	208854	`` Asleep . 
10014	br-m01	9	22	208857	Ben and Stinky went_home an hour ago and people started going_to_bed '' . 
10015	br-m01	10	23	208870	`` Oh '' . 
10016	br-m01	10	24	208874	Mike felt disappointed that Mahmoud had left ; he wanted to explain his new grokking . 
10017	br-m01	11	25	208890	`` I ought to be asleep , too , but I felt_like a snack . 
10018	br-m01	11	26	208905	Are you hungry '' ? 
10019	br-m01	12	27	208910	`` Sure , I'm hungry '' ! 
10020	br-m01	13	28	208917	`` Come_on , there 's some cold chicken and we 'll see what else '' . 
10021	br-m01	13	29	208933	They went downstairs , loaded a tray lavishly . 
10022	br-m01	13	30	208942	`` Let 's take it outside . 
10023	br-m01	13	31	208949	It 's plenty warm '' . 
10024	br-m01	14	32	208955	`` A fine idea '' , Mike agreed . 
10025	br-m01	15	33	208964	`` Warm enough to swim - real Indian_summer . 
10026	br-m01	15	34	208973	I 'll switch_on the floods '' . 
10027	br-m01	16	35	208980	`` Do n't bother '' , Mike answered . 
10028	br-m01	16	36	208989	`` I 'll carry the tray '' . 
10029	br-m01	16	37	208997	He could see in almost total_darkness . 
10030	br-m01	16	38	209004	Jubal said that his night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown_up , and Mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to_it ; his foster_parents had taught him to see . 
10031	br-m01	16	39	209042	As for the night being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on Mount_Everest but his water_brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure ; he was considerate of their weakness , once he learned of_it . 
10032	br-m01	16	40	209082	But he was looking_forward to snow - seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual , as he had read - walking barefoot , rolling in it . 
10033	br-m01	17	41	209118	In_the_meantime he was pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water_brother . 
10034	br-m01	18	42	209136	`` Okay , take the tray . 
10035	br-m01	18	43	209143	I 'll switch_on the underwater lights . 
10036	br-m01	18	44	209150	That 'll be plenty to eat by '' . 
10037	br-m01	19	45	209159	`` Fine '' . 
10038	br-m01	19	46	209163	Mike liked having light up through the ripples ; it was a goodness , beauty . 
10039	br-m01	19	47	209179	They picnicked by the pool , then lay back on the grass and looked at stars . 
10040	br-m01	20	48	209196	`` Mike , there 's Mars . 
10041	br-m01	20	49	209203	It is Mars , is n't it ? 
10042	br-m01	20	50	209211	Or Antares '' ? 
10043	br-m01	21	51	209215	`` It is Mars '' . 
10044	br-m01	22	52	209221	`` Mike ? 
10045	br-m01	22	53	209224	What are they doing on Mars '' ? 
10046	br-m01	23	54	209232	He hesitated ; the question was too wide for the sparse English_language . 
10047	br-m01	23	55	209245	`` On the side toward the horizon - the southern_hemisphere - it is spring ; plants are being taught to grow '' . 
10048	br-m01	24	56	209268	`` ' Taught to grow '' ' ? 
10049	br-m01	25	57	209276	He hesitated . 
10050	br-m01	25	58	209279	`` Larry teaches plants to grow . 
10051	br-m01	25	59	209286	I have helped him . 
10052	br-m01	25	60	209291	But my people - Martians , I mean ; I now grok you are my people - teach plants another way . 
10053	br-m01	25	61	209313	In the other hemisphere it is growing colder and nymphs , those who stayed alive through the summer , are being brought into nests for quickening and more growing '' . 
10054	br-m01	25	62	209344	He thought . 
10055	br-m01	25	63	209347	`` Of the humans we left at the equator , one has discorporated and the others are sad '' . 
10056	br-m01	26	64	209367	Yes , I heard it in the news `` . 
10057	br-m01	27	65	209377	Mike had not heard it ; he had not known it until asked . 
10058	br-m01	27	66	209391	`` They should not be sad . 
10059	br-m01	27	67	209398	Mr._Booker_T._W._Jones_Food_Technician First_Class is not sad ; the Old_Ones have cherished him '' . 
10060	br-m01	28	68	209411	`` You knew him '' ? 
10061	br-m01	29	69	209417	`` Yes . 
10062	br-m01	29	70	209420	He had his own face , dark and beautiful . 
10063	br-m01	29	71	209430	But he was homesick '' . 
10064	br-m01	30	72	209436	`` Oh , dear ! 
10065	br-m01	30	73	209441	Mike & & & do you ever get homesick ? 
10066	br-m01	30	74	209451	For Mars '' ? 
10067	br-m01	31	75	209455	`` At_first I was homesick '' , he answered . 
10068	br-m01	31	76	209465	`` I was lonely always '' . 
10069	br-m01	31	77	209472	He rolled toward her and took her in his arms . 
10070	br-m01	31	78	209483	`` But now I am not lonely . 
10071	br-m01	31	79	209491	I grok I shall never be lonely again '' . 
10072	br-m01	32	80	209501	`` Mike darling '' - They kissed , and went_on kissing . 
10073	br-m01	33	81	209513	Presently his water_brother said breathlessly . 
10074	br-m01	33	82	209519	`` Oh , my ! 
10075	br-m01	33	83	209524	That was almost worse than the first time '' . 
10076	br-m01	34	84	209534	`` You are all_right , my brother '' ? 
10077	br-m01	35	85	209543	`` Yes . 
10078	br-m01	35	86	209546	Yes indeed . 
10079	br-m01	35	87	209549	Kiss me again '' . 
10080	br-m01	36	88	209554	A long_time later , by cosmic clock , she said , `` Mike ? 
10081	br-m01	36	89	209568	Is that - I mean , ' Do you know '' ' - 
10082	br-m01	37	90	209581	`` I know . 
10083	br-m01	37	91	209585	It is for growing closer . 
10084	br-m01	37	92	209591	Now we grow closer '' . 
10085	br-m01	38	93	209597	`` Well & & & I 've been ready a long_time - goodness , we all have , but & & & never_mind , dear ; turn just a_little . 
10086	br-m01	38	94	209627	I 'll help '' . 
10087	br-m01	39	95	209632	As they merged , grokking together , Mike said softly and triumphantly : `` Thou art God '' . 
10088	br-m01	40	96	209651	Her answer was not in words . 
10089	br-m01	40	97	209658	Then , as their grokking made them ever closer and Mike felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice called him back : `` Oh ! 
10090	br-m01	40	98	209684	Oh ! 
10091	br-m01	40	99	209686	Thou art God '' ! 
10092	br-m01	41	100	209691	`` We grok God '' . 
10093	br-m01	42	101	209697	On Mars humans were building pressure_domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship . 
10094	br-m01	42	102	209716	This went faster than scheduled as the Martians were helpful . 
10095	br-m01	42	103	209727	Part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of Mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations . 
10096	br-m01	43	104	209762	The Old_Ones neither helped nor hindered this plan ; time was not_yet . 
10097	br-m01	43	105	209775	Their meditations were approaching a violent cusp that would shape Martian art for many millennia . 
10098	br-m01	43	106	209791	On Earth elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited_edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation_marks and spaces ; Time_magazine reviewed it and suggested that the Federation_Assembly_Daily_Record should be translated into the medium . 
10099	br-m01	44	107	209827	A colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs of plants and Mrs._Joseph_Shadow_of_Greatness_Douglas was quoted as saying : `` I would no_more sit_down without flowers on my table than without serviettes '' . 
10100	br-m01	44	108	209860	A Tibetan swami from Palermo , Sicily , announced in Beverly_Hills a newly discovered , ancient yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction between sexes . 
10101	br-m01	44	109	209891	His chelas were required to assume the matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud from Rig-Veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another room - nothing was stolen ; the purpose was less immediate . 
10102	br-m01	45	110	209931	The President_of_the_United_States proclaimed the first Sunday in November as `` National_Grandmothers_'_Day '' and urged America to say it with flowers . 
10103	br-m01	45	111	209952	A funeral_parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting . 
10104	br-m01	45	112	209960	Fosterite bishops , after secret conclave , announced the Church 's second Major_Miracle : Supreme_Bishop_Digby had been translated bodily to Heaven and spot-promoted to Archangel , ranking with-but-after Archangel_Foster . 
10105	br-m01	45	113	209990	The glorious news had been held_up pending Heavenly confirmation of the elevation of a new Supreme_Bishop , Huey_Short - a candidate accepted by the Boone faction after lots had been cast repeatedly . 
10106	br-m01	46	114	210023	L'Unita and Hoy published identical denunciations of Short 's elevation , l'Osservatore_Romano and the Christian_Science_Monitor ignored it , Times_of_India snickered at it , and the Manchester_Guardian simply reported it - the Fosterites in England were few but extremely militant . 
10107	br-m01	47	115	210063	Digby was not pleased with his promotion . 
10108	br-m01	47	116	210071	The Man_from_Mars had interrupted him with his work half finished - and that stupid jackass Short was certain to louse_it_up . 
10109	br-m01	47	117	210092	Foster listened with angelic patience until Digby ran_down , then said , `` Listen , junior , you 're an angel now - so forget it . 
10110	br-m01	47	118	210119	Eternity is no time for recriminations . 
10111	br-m01	47	119	210126	You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me . 
10112	br-m01	47	120	210137	Afterwards you did well enough . 
10113	br-m01	47	121	210143	Now that Short is Supreme_Bishop he 'll do all_right , he can n't help it . 
10114	br-m01	47	122	210159	Same as with the Popes . 
10115	br-m01	47	123	210165	Some of them were warts until they got promoted . 
10116	br-m01	47	124	210175	Check with one of them , go_ahead - there 's no professional jealousy here '' . 
10117	br-m01	48	125	210191	Digby calmed_down , but made one request . 
10118	br-m01	49	126	210199	Foster shook his halo . 
10119	br-m01	49	127	210204	`` You can n't touch him . 
10120	br-m01	49	128	210211	You should n't have tried to . 
10121	br-m01	49	129	210218	Oh , you can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself . 
10122	br-m01	49	130	210238	But , I'm telling you , it 'll be turned_down - you do n't understand the System yet . 
10123	br-m01	49	131	210257	The Martians have their own setup , different from ours , and as_long_as they need him , we can n't touch him . 
10124	br-m01	49	132	210280	They run_their_show their way - the Universe has variety , something for everybody - a fact you field workers often miss '' . 
10125	br-m01	50	133	210303	`` You mean this punk can brush me aside and I 've got_to hold still for it '' ? 
10126	br-m01	51	134	210322	`` I held still for the same thing , did n't I ? 
10127	br-m01	51	135	210335	I'm helping you now , am I not ? 
10128	br-m01	51	136	210344	Now look , there 's work to be done and lots of it . 
10129	br-m01	51	137	210358	The Boss wants performance , not gripes . 
10130	br-m01	51	138	210366	If you need a Day_off to calm_down , duck over to the Muslim_Paradise and take it . 
10131	br-m01	51	139	210383	Otherwise , straighten your halo , square your wings , and dig_in . 
10132	br-m01	51	140	210396	The sooner you act like an angel the quicker you 'll feel angelic . 
10133	br-m01	51	141	210410	Get Happy , junior '' ! 
10134	br-m01	52	142	210416	Digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh . 
10135	br-m01	52	143	210423	`` Okay , I'm Happy . 
10136	br-m01	52	144	210429	Where do I start '' ? 
10137	br-m01	53	145	210435	Jubal did not hear of Digby 's disappearance when it was announced , and , when he did , while he had a fleeting suspicion , he dismissed it ; if Mike had had_a_finger_in it , he had gotten_away_with it - and what happened to supreme bishops worried Jubal not at_all as_long_as he was n't bothered . 
10138	br-m01	54	146	210492	His household had gone_through an upset . 
10139	br-m01	54	147	210499	Jubal deduced what had happened but did not know with whom - and did n't want to inquire . 
10140	br-m01	54	148	210518	Mike was of legal_age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches . 
10141	br-m01	54	149	210532	Anyhow , it was high_time the boy was salted . 
10142	br-m01	55	150	210542	Jubal could n't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting - ABC vs D , then BCD vs A & & & or AB vs CD , or AD vs CB , through all ways that four women can gang_up on each other . 
10143	br-m01	56	151	210592	This continued most of the week following that ill-starred trip to church , during which period Mike stayed in his room and usually in a trance so deep that Jubal would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before . 
10144	br-m01	56	152	210634	Jubal would not have minded it if service had not gone_to_pieces . 
10145	br-m01	56	153	210646	The girls seemed to spend half their time tiptoeing in `` to see if Mike was all_right '' and they were too preoccupied to cook , much less be secretaries . 
10146	br-m01	56	154	210677	Even rock-steady Anne - Hell , Anne was the worst ! 
10147	br-m01	56	155	210688	Absent-minded , subject_to unexplained tears . 
10148	br-m01	56	156	210694	Jubal would have bet his life that if Anne were to witness the Second_Coming , she would memorize date , time , personae , events , and barometric_pressure without batting her calm blue eyes . 
10149	br-m02	1	1	210729	The expense and time involved are astronomical . 
10150	br-m02	1	2	210737	However , we sent a third vessel out , a much smaller and faster one than the first two . 
10151	br-m02	1	3	210757	We have learned much about interstellar drives since a_hundred years ago ; that is all I can tell you about them . 
10152	br-m02	2	4	210779	`` But the third ship came_back several years ago and reported & & & '' . 
10153	br-m02	3	5	210795	`` That it had found a planet on which human_beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings '' ! said Hal , forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak . 
10154	br-m02	4	6	210833	Macneff stopped pacing to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes . 
10155	br-m02	5	7	210846	`` How did you know '' ? he said sharply . 
10156	br-m02	6	8	210857	`` Forgive me , Sandalphon '' , said Hal . 
10157	br-m02	6	9	210867	`` But it was inevitable ! 
10158	br-m02	6	10	210873	Did not the Forerunner predict in his Time and the World_Line that such a planet would be found ? 
10159	br-m02	6	11	210892	I believe it was on page 573 '' ! 
10160	br-m02	7	12	210901	Macneff smiled and said , `` I am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression '' . 
10161	br-m02	8	13	210921	How could they not ? 
10162	br-m02	8	14	210926	thought Hal . 
10163	br-m02	8	15	210929	Besides , they were not the only impressions . 
10164	br-m02	8	16	210938	I still bear scars on my back where Pornsen , my gapt , whipped me because I had not learned my lessons well enough . 
10165	br-m02	8	17	210963	He was a good impresser , that Pornsen . 
10166	br-m02	8	18	210972	Was ? 
10167	br-m02	8	19	210974	Is ! 
10168	br-m02	8	20	210976	As I grew older and was promoted , so was he , always where I was . 
10169	br-m02	8	21	210993	He was my gapt in the creche . 
10170	br-m02	8	22	211001	He was the dormitory gapt when I went_to college and thought I was getting_away from him . 
10171	br-m02	8	23	211018	He is now my block gapt . 
10172	br-m02	8	24	211025	He is the one responsible_for my getting such low M.R. 's . 
10173	br-m02	9	25	211037	Swiftly , came the revulsion , the protest . 
10174	br-m02	9	26	211046	No , not he , for I , and I alone , am responsible_for whatever happens to me . 
10175	br-m02	9	27	211065	If I get a low M._R. , I do so because I want it that way or my dark self does . 
10176	br-m02	9	28	211087	If I die , I die because I willed it so . 
10177	br-m02	9	29	211099	So , forgive me , Sigmen , for the contrary to reality thoughts ! 
10178	br-m02	10	30	211113	`` Please pardon me again , Sandalphon '' , said Hal . 
10179	br-m02	10	31	211125	`` But did the expedition find any records of the Forerunner having been on this planet ? 
10180	br-m02	10	32	211142	Perhaps , even , though this is too_much to wish , find the Forerunner himself '' ? 
10181	br-m02	11	33	211159	`` No '' , said Macneff . 
10182	br-m02	11	34	211166	`` Though that does not mean that there may not be such records there . 
10183	br-m02	11	35	211181	The expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and_then to return to Earth . 
10184	br-m02	11	36	211199	I can n't tell you now the distance in light_years or what star this was , though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere . 
10185	br-m02	11	37	211230	If you volunteer , you will be told where you 're going after the ship leaves . 
10186	br-m02	11	38	211247	And it leaves very soon '' . 
10187	br-m02	12	39	211254	`` You need a linguist '' ? said Hal . 
10188	br-m02	13	40	211264	`` The ship is huge '' , said Macneff , `` but the number of military_men and specialists we are taking limits the linguists to one . 
10189	br-m02	13	41	211291	We have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion . 
10190	br-m02	13	42	211306	Unfortunately & & & '' . 
10191	br-m02	14	43	211312	Hal waited : Macneff paced some more , frowning . 
10192	br-m02	14	44	211322	Then , he said , `` Unfortunately , only one lamechian linguist exists , and he is too old for this expedition . 
10193	br-m02	14	45	211345	Therefore & & & '' . 
10194	br-m02	15	46	211351	`` A_thousand pardons '' , said Hal . 
10195	br-m02	15	47	211359	`` But I have just thought_of one thing . 
10196	br-m02	15	48	211368	I am married '' . 
10197	br-m02	16	49	211373	`` No problem at_all '' , said Macneff . 
10198	br-m02	16	50	211382	`` There will be no women aboard the Gabriel . 
10199	br-m02	16	51	211392	And , if a man is married , he will automatically be given a divorce '' . 
10200	br-m02	17	52	211409	Hal gasped , and he said , `` A divorce '' ? 
10201	br-m02	18	53	211421	Macneff raised his hands apologetically and said , `` You are horrified , of_course . 
10202	br-m02	18	54	211436	But , from our reading of the Western_Talmud , we Urielites believe that the Forerunner , knowing this situation would arise , made reference to and provision for divorce . 
10203	br-m02	18	55	211466	It 's inevitable in_this case , for the couple will be separated for , at_the_least , forty years . 
10204	br-m02	18	56	211485	Naturally , he couched the provision in obscure language . 
10205	br-m02	18	57	211495	In his great and glorious wisdom , he knew that our enemies the Israelites must not be able to read therein what we planned '' . 
10206	br-m02	19	58	211521	`` I volunteer '' , said Hal . 
10207	br-m02	19	59	211529	`` Tell me more , Sandalphon '' . 
10208	br-m02	20	60	211537	Six months later , Hal_Yarrow stood in the observation_dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth dwindle above him . 
10209	br-m02	20	61	211559	It was night on this hemisphere , but the light blazed from the megalopolises of Australia , Japan , China , Southeast_Asia , India , Siberia . 
10210	br-m02	20	62	211586	Hal , the linguist , saw the glittering discs and necklaces in_terms_of the languages spoken therein . 
10211	br-m02	20	63	211603	Australia , the Philippine_Islands , Japan , and northern China were inhabited by those members of the Haijac_Union that spoke American . 
10212	br-m02	21	64	211625	Southern_China , all_of southeast Asia , southern India and Ceylon , these states of the Malay_Federation spoke Bazaar . 
10213	br-m02	22	65	211644	Siberia spoke Icelandic . 
10214	br-m02	23	66	211648	His mind turned the globe swiftly for him , and he visualized Africa , which used Swahili south of the Sahara_Sea . 
10215	br-m02	23	67	211670	All_around the Mediterranean_Sea , Asia_Minor , northern India , and Tibet , Hebrew was the native tongue . 
10216	br-m02	23	68	211688	In southern Europe , between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic_speaking peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called March . 
10217	br-m02	23	69	211715	This was no_man's_land , disputed by the Haijac_Union and the Israeli_Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years . 
10218	br-m02	23	70	211739	Neither nation would give_up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic_War . 
10219	br-m02	23	71	211763	So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own borders ) . 
10220	br-m02	23	72	211791	Its citizens spoke all_of the world 's surviving tongues , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet_of_paper . 
10221	br-m02	24	73	211833	Hal saw in his mind the rest of Earth : Iceland , Greenland , the Caribbean_Islands , and the eastern half of South_America . 
10222	br-m02	24	74	211857	Here the peoples spoke the tongue of Iceland because that island had gotten_the_jump_on the Hawaiian Americans who were busy resettling North_America and the western half of South_America after the Apocalyptic_War . 
10223	br-m02	25	75	211888	Then there was North_America , where American was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of French-Canadians living on the Hudson_Bay_Preserve . 
10224	br-m02	26	76	211912	Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone , Sigmen_City would blaze_out into space . 
10225	br-m02	26	77	211932	And , somewhere in_that enormous light , was his apartment . 
10226	br-m02	26	78	211943	But Mary would soon no_longer be living there , for she would be notified in a_few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti . 
10227	br-m02	26	79	211975	She would weep in_private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way , though in_public she would be dry_eyed . 
10228	br-m02	26	80	212000	Her friends and professional associates would sympathize_with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically . 
10229	br-m02	26	81	212031	If Hal_Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way . 
10230	br-m02	26	82	212048	There was no such thing as an `` accident '' . 
10231	br-m02	26	83	212059	Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in_this web of elaborate frauds to cover_up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die . 
10232	br-m02	26	84	212095	And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony . 
10233	br-m02	26	85	212119	No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared . 
10234	br-m02	27	86	212133	Hal felt sorry_for Mary ; he had_a_time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation_dome . 
10235	br-m02	28	87	212159	Yet , he told himself , this was the best way . 
10236	br-m02	28	88	212171	He and Mary would no_longer have to tear and rend at each other ; their mutual torture would be over . 
10237	br-m02	28	89	212192	Mary was free to marry again , not knowing that the Sturch had secretly given her a divorce , thinking that death had dissolved her marriage . 
10238	br-m02	28	90	212219	She would have a year in which to make_up her mind , to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt . 
10239	br-m02	28	91	212243	Perhaps , the psychological barriers that had prevented her from conceiving Hal 's child would no_longer be present . 
10240	br-m02	28	92	212262	Perhaps . 
10241	br-m02	28	93	212264	Hal doubted if this happy event would occur . 
10242	br-m02	28	94	212273	Mary was as frozen below the navel as he . 
10243	br-m02	28	95	212283	No_matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt . 
10244	br-m02	29	96	212294	The gapt . 
10245	br-m02	29	97	212297	Pornsen . 
10246	br-m02	29	98	212299	He would no_longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice . 
10247	br-m02	30	99	212314	`` Hal_Yarrow '' ! said the whining voice . 
10248	br-m02	31	100	212323	And , slowly , feeling himself icy yet burning , Hal turned . 
10249	br-m02	32	101	212336	There was the squat loose_jowled man , smiling lopsidedly up at him . 
10250	br-m02	33	102	212349	`` My beloved ward , my perennial gadfly '' , said the whining voice . 
10251	br-m02	33	103	212364	`` I had no idea that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage . 
10252	br-m02	33	104	212381	But I might have known ! 
10253	br-m02	33	105	212387	We seem to be bound by love ; Sigmen himself must have foreseen it . 
10254	br-m02	33	106	212402	Love to you , my ward '' . 
10255	br-m02	34	107	212410	`` Sigmen love you , too , my guardian '' , said Hal , choking . 
10256	br-m02	34	108	212426	`` How wonderful to see your cherished self . 
10257	br-m02	34	109	212435	I had thought we would never again speak_to each other '' . 
10258	br-m02	35	110	212447	The Gabriel pointed towards her destination and , under one gee acceleration , began to build_up towards her ultimate velocity , 99.1 percent of the speed_of_light . 
10259	br-m02	35	111	212474	Meanwhile , all the personnel except those few needed to carry_out the performance of the ship , went_into the suspensor . 
10260	br-m02	35	112	212495	Here they would lie in suspended_animation for many years . 
10261	br-m02	35	113	212505	Some time later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others . 
10262	br-m02	35	114	212527	They would sleep while the Gabriel 's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured . 
10263	br-m02	35	115	212554	Upon reaching the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut_off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey 's end . 
10264	br-m02	36	116	212587	Many years later , the photon counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration . 
10265	br-m02	36	117	212613	Again , a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied . 
10266	br-m02	36	118	212628	Then , after slowing the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a one gee deceleration . 
10267	br-m02	36	119	212646	And the crew would be automatically brought_out of their suspended_animation . 
10268	br-m02	36	120	212657	These members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel . 
10269	br-m02	36	121	212668	And , in the half year left before reaching their destination , the men would carry_out whatever preparations were needed . 
10270	br-m02	37	122	212689	Hal_Yarrow was among the last to go_into the suspensor and among the first to come_out . 
10271	br-m02	37	123	212705	He had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen , Siddo . 
10272	br-m02	37	124	212723	And , from the first , he faced a difficult task . 
10273	br-m02	37	125	212735	The expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words . 
10274	br-m02	37	126	212757	The description of the Siddo syntax was very restricted . 
10275	br-m02	37	127	212767	And , as Hal found_out , obviously mistaken in many cases . 
10276	br-m02	38	128	212779	This discovery caused Hal anxiety . 
10277	br-m02	38	129	212785	His duty was to write a school_text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen . 
10278	br-m02	38	130	212806	Yet , if he used all_of the little means at his disposal , he would be instructing his students wrongly . 
10279	br-m02	38	131	212827	Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult . 
10280	br-m02	39	132	212837	For_one_thing , the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen 's ; the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , dissimilar . 
10281	br-m02	39	133	212865	It was true that they could be approximated , but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations ? 
10282	br-m02	40	134	212882	Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo . 
10283	br-m02	40	135	212891	Consider the tense_system . 
10284	br-m02	40	136	212895	Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future , Siddo used an entirely different word . 
10285	br-m02	40	137	212919	Thus , the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , meaning to live , was , in the perfect_tense , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future , mai'teipa . 
10286	br-m02	40	138	212947	The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses . 
10287	br-m02	40	139	212962	Plus the fact that Siddo not_only had the normal ( to Earthmen ) three genders of masculine , feminine , and neuter , but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual . 
10288	br-m02	40	140	212994	Fortunately , gender was inflected , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo . 
10289	br-m02	40	141	213015	The system of indicating gender varied according to tense . 
10290	br-m02	41	142	213025	All the other parts_of_speech : nouns , pronouns , adjectives , adverbs , and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs . 
10291	br-n05	1	1	213049	She was carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist . 
10292	br-n05	2	2	213073	`` I saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger . 
10293	br-n05	2	3	213094	`` You could burn_down this whole mountainside with a fire that size . 
10294	br-n05	2	4	213107	It would n't matter_to a fool like you . 
10295	br-n05	2	5	213116	It would to me '' . 
10296	br-n05	3	6	213122	`` All_right '' , Wilson said quickly . 
10297	br-n05	3	7	213130	`` The fire 's too big . 
10298	br-n05	3	8	213137	And I appreciate the advice '' . 
10299	br-n05	4	9	213144	He was losing patience again . 
10300	br-n05	4	10	213150	An hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company . 
10301	br-n05	4	11	213171	She had helped him change his mind . 
10302	br-n05	5	12	213179	`` I'm not advising you '' , she said . 
10303	br-n05	5	13	213189	`` I'm telling you . 
10304	br-n05	5	14	213194	That fire 's too big . 
10305	br-n05	5	15	213200	Let it burn_down . 
10306	br-n05	5	16	213204	And make_sure it 's out when you leave in the morning '' . 
10307	br-n05	6	17	213217	He was taken_aback . 
10308	br-n05	6	18	213221	It took him a long_time to compose himself . 
10309	br-n05	7	19	213230	`` There 's some mistake '' , he said finally . 
10310	br-n05	7	20	213241	`` You 're right about the fire . 
10311	br-n05	7	21	213249	It 's bigger than it has to be , though I do n't see where it 's doing any harm . 
10312	br-n05	7	22	213270	But you 're wrong about the rest of_it . 
10313	br-n05	7	23	213279	I'm not leaving in the morning . 
10314	br-n05	7	24	213286	Why should I ? 
10315	br-n05	7	25	213290	I own the place '' . 
10316	br-n05	8	26	213296	She showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face . 
10317	br-n05	8	27	213321	It did n't seem to tell her anything . 
10318	br-n05	8	28	213330	She glanced around the clearing , taking_in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground , the two kids , the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight . 
10319	br-n05	8	29	213372	She studied it for a long_time . 
10320	br-n05	8	30	213379	Then she turned_back to Wilson and smiled , and he was n't quite sure what she meant by it . 
10321	br-n05	9	31	213399	`` You own this place '' ? she said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly . 
10322	br-n05	9	32	213420	`` You bought it '' ? 
10323	br-n05	10	33	213426	`` From a man in St._Louis '' , Wilson said . 
10324	br-n05	10	34	213437	`` Jake_Carwood . 
10325	br-n05	10	35	213440	Maybe you know him '' . 
10326	br-n05	11	36	213446	The girl laughed . 
10327	br-n05	11	37	213450	`` I know him . 
10328	br-n05	11	38	213455	I ought to . 
10329	br-n05	11	39	213459	My father ran him off here six years ago '' . 
10330	br-n05	12	40	213470	Wilson did n't say anything . 
10331	br-n05	12	41	213476	He stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next . 
10332	br-n05	12	42	213488	She had picked_up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him . 
10333	br-n05	13	43	213505	`` Carwood did n't tell you that '' , she said . 
10334	br-n05	14	44	213517	`` No '' , Wilson said . 
10335	br-n05	14	45	213524	`` But it 's understandable . 
10336	br-n05	14	46	213530	It 's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of . 
10337	br-n05	14	47	213545	And it does n't make any difference . 
10338	br-n05	14	48	213553	He sold me a clear title . 
10339	br-n05	14	49	213560	I have it with me , right here . 
10340	br-n05	14	50	213569	If you want to see '' - 
10341	br-n05	15	51	213576	`` Never_mind '' , she said sternly . 
10342	br-n05	15	52	213584	`` It would n't matter_to my father , and not to me . 
10343	br-n05	15	53	213597	I meant what I said about that fire . 
10344	br-n05	15	54	213606	Be sure it 's out when you leave . 
10345	br-n05	15	55	213615	That 's all . 
10346	br-n05	15	56	213619	I 'll let you go_back to doing the dishes now '' . 
10347	br-n05	16	57	213631	It was meant to insult him , and did n't quite succeed . 
10348	br-n05	16	58	213644	He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now . 
10349	br-n05	16	59	213666	`` I do n't mind washing dishes now_and_then '' , he said pleasantly . 
10350	br-n05	16	60	213680	`` It does n't hurt . 
10351	br-n05	16	61	213686	It might hurt you , though . 
10352	br-n05	16	62	213693	Somebody might mistake you for a woman '' . 
10353	br-n05	17	63	213702	He meant to say more , but he never got the chance . 
10354	br-n05	17	64	213715	She was quick . 
10355	br-n05	17	65	213719	She brought the quirt down , slashing it across his cheek , and he tried to step back . 
10356	br-n05	17	66	213738	She swung the quirt again , and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle . 
10357	br-n05	18	67	213759	She came_down against him , and he tried to break her fall . 
10358	br-n05	18	68	213772	He grabbed her by the shoulders and went_down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him . 
10359	br-n05	18	69	213799	It made him a_little sick , and he let_go_of her . 
10360	br-n05	18	70	213810	He got_up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her . 
10361	br-n05	18	71	213828	He wiped the blood from his cheek . 
10362	br-n05	19	72	213836	`` I ought to '' - he said . 
10363	br-n05	19	73	213845	He was shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful gasps . 
10364	br-n05	19	74	213860	`` That quirt - I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good . 
10365	br-n05	19	75	213880	If you were a man '' - 
10366	br-n05	20	76	213887	`` She is n't , mister '' . 
10367	br-n05	21	77	213895	The voice came from behind him , and Wilson turned . 
10368	br-n05	21	78	213906	The fire had gone_down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees . 
10369	br-n05	21	79	213922	But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him . 
10370	br-n05	21	80	213944	He was tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed , Wilson thought . 
10371	br-n05	21	81	213956	And he was handsome , despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek . 
10372	br-n05	22	82	213972	`` She 's not a man , mister '' , he said . 
10373	br-n05	22	83	213985	`` I am . 
10374	br-n05	22	84	213989	If you 've got any ideas '' . 
10375	br-n05	22	85	213997	He raised the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson 's chest . 
10376	br-n05	23	86	214009	`` Put the rifle down , Joseph '' , the girl said . 
10377	br-n05	23	87	214022	She seemed irritated . 
10378	br-n05	23	88	214026	`` I thought I told you to stay home '' . 
10379	br-n05	24	89	214037	The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap . 
10380	br-n05	24	90	214050	The scar looked pure white in the half darkness ; his eyes were black and deep-set , and expressionless . 
10381	br-n05	24	91	214070	`` You should n't be riding up_here after dark , Judith '' , he said quietly . 
10382	br-n05	24	92	214087	`` I can take_care of this . 
10383	br-n05	24	93	214094	It 's no job for you '' . 
10384	br-n05	25	94	214102	The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him . 
10385	br-n05	25	95	214116	He took it without flinching . 
10386	br-n05	26	96	214122	`` I said go_home , Joseph . 
10387	br-n05	26	97	214129	You 've got no business up_here '' . 
10388	br-n05	27	98	214137	The half-breed did n't answer this time . 
10389	br-n05	27	99	214145	But the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eyes were hurt and angry . 
10390	br-n05	27	100	214167	It made Wilson wonder . 
10391	br-n05	27	101	214172	He watched the half-breed as he turned silently . 
10392	br-n05	27	102	214181	They could hear the pony 's feet on the dry leaves for_a_while , then the sound faded_out . 
10393	br-n05	28	103	214199	Wilson brushed the dust from his coat . 
10394	br-n05	28	104	214207	`` Who was that '' ? he asked . 
10395	br-n05	28	105	214216	`` Your personal guard ? 
10396	br-n05	28	106	214221	You 're pretty hard on him '' . 
10397	br-n05	29	107	214229	`` He works for my father '' , the girl said , and_then seemed to change her mind . 
10398	br-n05	29	108	214248	`` He 's a friend . 
10399	br-n05	29	109	214254	His name 's Joseph_Sanchez . 
10400	br-n05	29	110	214259	Is there anything else you want to know '' ? 
10401	br-n05	30	111	214269	`` Not now '' , Wilson said . 
10402	br-n05	30	112	214277	`` I guess I 'll find_out soon_enough . 
10403	br-n05	30	113	214285	You 've got blood on your cheek . 
10404	br-n05	30	114	214293	Not yours . 
10405	br-n05	30	115	214296	Mine . 
10406	br-n05	30	116	214298	It must have got there when you fell against me '' . 
10407	br-n05	31	117	214310	She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat . 
10408	br-n05	32	118	214321	`` I 'll bet that 's as_close_as you 've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said . 
10409	br-n05	33	119	214344	He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist . 
10410	br-n05	33	120	214368	`` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now . 
10411	br-n05	33	121	214384	`` I 've had enough of_that . 
10412	br-n05	33	122	214391	I 've had enough of you . 
10413	br-n05	33	123	214398	I do n't know what goes_on around here , and I do n't care . 
10414	br-n05	33	124	214413	I do n't know what makes you think you can get_away with this kind_of business , and I do n't care about that , either . 
10415	br-n05	33	125	214439	You took me by surprise . 
10416	br-n05	33	126	214445	But I 'll know how to handle you next time '' . 
10417	br-n05	34	127	214457	She brought_up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker . 
10418	br-n05	34	128	214473	He side-stepped her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding . 
10419	br-n05	34	129	214486	She finally regained her balance and got_up in the saddle . 
10420	br-n05	34	130	214497	Her hat had come_off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before . 
10421	br-n05	34	131	214528	He had forgotten that she was so pretty . 
10422	br-n05	34	132	214537	But her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : 
10423	br-n05	34	133	214556	cruelty , meanness , self-will . 
10424	br-n05	34	134	214562	He had known women like that , one woman in_particular . 
10425	br-n05	34	135	214573	And one had been too many . 
10426	br-n05	34	136	214580	He watched the girl until she had gone_into the trees , and waited until he could n't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went_up to where the children were sleeping . 
10427	br-n05	35	137	214615	They were n't sleeping , of_course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending . 
10428	br-n05	35	138	214634	He had n't shown_up too well in their eyes , letting himself be browbeaten by a woman . 
10429	br-n05	35	139	214652	They expected greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed . 
10430	br-n05	35	140	214671	And determined not to show it . 
10431	br-n05	35	141	214678	They lay a_little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed . 
10432	br-n05	36	142	214692	`` Go_to_sleep '' , he said . 
10433	br-n05	36	143	214699	`` Both of you . 
10434	br-n05	36	144	214704	There 's better things to do than listen to something like that . 
10435	br-n05	36	145	214717	I 'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes , if you want me '' . 
10436	br-n05	37	146	214734	He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream . 
10437	br-n05	37	147	214752	The coyote was calling again , and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it . 
10438	br-n05	37	148	214774	Not tonight , at_any_rate . 
10439	br-n05	37	149	214779	He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble . 
10440	br-n05	37	150	214789	If she did , he could stand it better in the light . 
10441	br-n05	38	151	214802	He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned_out . 
10442	br-n05	38	152	214816	That afternoon when they had pulled_up in_front_of the broken-down ranch_house , his hopes had been high . 
10443	br-n05	38	153	214833	Already some of the pain had gone from Amelia 's death . 
10444	br-n05	38	154	214845	Not all_of it . 
10445	br-n05	38	155	214849	There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief . 
10446	br-n05	38	156	214864	But they were starting a new life . 
10447	br-n05	38	157	214872	And they had almost everything they needed : land , a house , two whiteface bulls , three horses . 
10448	br-n05	39	158	214892	The land was n't all Wilson had expected of_it . 
10449	br-n05	39	159	214902	Six hundred and forty acres , the old_man back in St._Louis had said ; good grass , good water . 
10450	br-n05	39	160	214922	Well , the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it . 
10451	br-n05	39	161	214946	The water was there , so much of_it that it spread all_through the dead orchard . 
10452	br-n05	39	162	214962	And there was a house ; livable perhaps , but badly in_need_of repairs . 
10453	br-n05	40	163	214976	In_the_last_analysis , though , Wilson had little cause to complain . 
10454	br-n05	40	164	214987	The place had been cheap - just the little he had left after Amelia 's burial - and it would serve its purpose . 
10455	br-n05	40	165	215011	There was only one place where Jake_Carwood 's description had gone badly awry : the peace and quiet . 
10456	br-n05	40	166	215030	It had n't started_out that way . 
10457	br-n05	40	167	215037	And he had a feeling - thanks to the girl - that things would get worse before they got better . 
10458	br-n05	41	168	215058	They had the house cleaned_up by noon , and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses . 
10459	br-n05	41	169	215081	He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness , and finally went over to help him . 
10460	br-n05	41	170	215103	Kathy was already in the wagon . 
10461	br-n05	41	171	215110	They were going_to town , and they were both excited . 
10462	br-n05	42	172	215121	Wilson backed the team into the traces , and wished they were n't going_to town at_all . 
10463	br-n05	42	173	215138	He had an uneasy feeling about it . 
10464	br-n05	42	174	215146	That girl last night , what was her name ? 
10465	br-n05	42	175	215156	Judith_Pierce . 
10466	br-n05	42	176	215158	It was the only thing about her that was the_least_bit hard to remember . 
10467	br-n05	43	177	215172	He finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him . 
10468	br-n05	43	178	215187	He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than Judith_Pierce had made it seem . 
10469	br-n05	43	179	215215	There was brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow under , and places so steep that cattle would n't stop to graze . 
10470	br-n05	43	180	215242	But there was water . 
10471	br-n05	43	181	215247	There was an artificial_lake just out_of_sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen springs that popped_out of the ground above the hillside orchard . 
10472	br-n05	43	182	215276	Yes , there was plenty of water , too_much , and that was probably the trouble . 
10473	br-n05	43	183	215293	There were tracks of cattle all_over his six hundred and forty acres . 
10474	br-n05	44	184	215306	The first part of the road was steep , but it leveled_off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley . 
10475	br-n05	44	185	215329	It was hotter once they reached the flat , and drier , but the grass was better . 
10476	br-n05	44	186	215347	A warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves . 
10477	br-n05	44	187	215359	A red-tailed_hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir_up from the side of the road . 
10478	br-n05	44	188	215386	It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville . 
10479	br-n05	45	189	215401	The town was about what Wilson expected : one main_street with its rows of false-fronted buildings , a water_tower , a_few warehouses , a single hotel ; all dusty and sunbaked . 
10480	br-n05	45	190	215433	The place was quiet . 
10481	br-p01	1	1	215438	They neither liked nor disliked the Old_Man . 
10482	br-p01	1	2	215446	To them he could have been the broken bell in the church_tower which rang before and after Mass , and at noon , and at six each evening - its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets . 
10483	br-p01	1	3	215490	The Old_Man was unimportant . 
10484	br-p01	2	4	215495	Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen_door in early June ; or the smell of thick tomato_paste - the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour - rising_up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly dotted cheesecloth . 
10485	br-p01	2	5	215552	Or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street_lights . 
10486	br-p01	2	6	215577	Or the bay of female dogs in heat . 
10487	br-p01	3	7	215586	They never called him by name , although he had one . 
10488	br-p01	3	8	215598	Filippo_Rossi , that 's what he was called in the old_country ; but here he was just Signore or the Old_Man . 
10489	br-p01	3	9	215620	But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders . 
10490	br-p01	3	10	215641	Youth obeyed when commanded . 
10491	br-p01	3	11	215646	It went_to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went_to confession . 
10492	br-p01	3	12	215659	But youth asked nothing of its parents - not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in_passing . 
10493	br-p01	4	13	215679	The only thing unusual about the Old_Man had long_since happened . 
10494	br-p01	4	14	215690	But the past was dead here as the present was dead . 
10495	br-p01	4	15	215702	Once the Old_Man had had a wife . 
10496	br-p01	4	16	215710	And once she , too , ignored him . 
10497	br-p01	4	17	215719	With a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders , she wiggled her satin covered buttocks down the street before him and did n't stop . 
10498	br-p01	4	18	215744	In one hand she clutched a hundred_dollar_bill and in the other a straw suitcase . 
10499	br-p01	4	19	215759	The way she strutted down the street , the Old_Man would have been blind not to have noticed both . 
10500	br-p01	4	20	215779	Without looking at him , without looking at anything except Drexel_Street directly in_front of her , she climbed_up into one of those orange streetcars , rode_away in it , and never came_back . 
10501	br-p01	5	21	215812	`` But she should n't have come here in_the_first_place '' , the women had said . 
10502	br-p01	6	22	215828	`` No , no . 
10503	br-p01	6	23	215833	Not that one . 
10504	br-p01	6	24	215837	She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino '' . 
10505	br-p01	7	25	215852	`` Eh , Torino ! 
10506	br-p01	7	26	215857	She gave herself fancy airs ! 
10507	br-p01	7	27	215863	Just because she had a part on_the_stage in the old_country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours '' . 
10508	br-p01	7	28	215886	They had slapped their thighs . 
10509	br-p01	8	29	215892	`` It 's not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good '' . 
10510	br-p01	9	30	215910	`` Henh '' ! 
10511	br-p01	9	31	215914	Calloused fingers , caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted , never to be tweezed away . 
10512	br-p01	9	32	215944	Mauve colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man 's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again_and_again . 
10513	br-p01	9	33	215975	`` Puttana '' ! 
10514	br-p01	10	34	215979	But if the Old_Man even thought_about his wife now , nobody cared_a_fig . 
10515	br-p01	10	35	215992	It was enough for people to know that at_one_time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed - watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner . 
10516	br-p01	10	36	216041	His voice had not commanded her to stop . 
10517	br-p01	10	37	216050	It had not questioned why . 
10518	br-p01	10	38	216056	The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; but he might have been shooing_away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him . 
10519	br-p01	10	39	216085	( He was never without that dog . ) 
10520	br-p01	10	40	216094	And his eyes - those miniature sundials of variegated yellow - had not altered their expression or direction . 
10521	br-p01	10	41	216113	The Old_Man 's very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he would n't have had anyone know it . 
10522	br-p01	11	42	216138	Perhaps he had known then where that hundred_dollar_bill had come from and where it was taking his wife . 
10523	br-p01	11	43	216157	But when he called_for his withered , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ? 
10524	br-p01	12	44	216196	There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel_Street and his back in_opposition to the church behind him . 
10525	br-p01	12	45	216225	For all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the outskirts of Philadelphia . 
10526	br-p01	12	46	216249	It could have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled . 
10527	br-p01	12	47	216262	What did it matter_to him that the park at the foot of Ash_Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city 's center at half-hour intervals ? 
10528	br-p01	12	48	216294	Or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the Schuylkill ? 
10529	br-p01	12	49	216307	This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness . 
10530	br-p01	12	50	216325	To him they were one_and_the_same . 
10531	br-p01	13	51	216331	Sameness for the Old_Man was framed_in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city . 
10532	br-p01	13	52	216351	Sameness lined the streets with two story houses the color of ash . 
10533	br-p01	13	53	216364	It slashed the sloping manure scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches . 
10534	br-p01	13	54	216382	It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen_doors . 
10535	br-p01	14	55	216397	Even the stable garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it . 
10536	br-p01	14	56	216418	And the coffee_shop on Drexel_Street , where the men spent their evenings and Sundays playing cards , had a rose hedge beneath its window . 
10537	br-p01	14	57	216443	The hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it . 
10538	br-p01	15	58	216453	Only one house on the street had no lawn before it . 
10539	br-p01	15	59	216465	It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade . 
10540	br-p01	15	60	216483	That was Bartoli 's shop . 
10541	br-p01	15	61	216489	Above it , from a second story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood . 
10542	br-p01	15	62	216504	Did the Old_Man remember them there ? 
10543	br-p01	16	63	216511	Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square_blocks - like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery . 
10544	br-p01	16	64	216550	Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man 's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy . 
10545	br-p01	16	65	216594	Love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by fig_trees and grape_vines . 
10546	br-p01	16	66	216610	And the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back_porch to back_porch . 
10547	br-p01	17	67	216625	The Old_Man silently fed_upon these streets . 
10548	br-p01	17	68	216632	They kept him alive , waiting . 
10549	br-p01	17	69	216639	Waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not . 
10550	br-p01	17	70	216654	It was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not_yet time to pay the price . 
10551	br-p01	17	71	216678	He was holding_out for something . 
10552	br-p01	17	72	216684	He was determined to hold_out . 
10553	br-p01	18	73	216690	The Old_Man 's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking_in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich . 
10554	br-p01	18	74	216722	At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother , that he could n't remember her face or her touch ; neither did he care that Aunt_Rose provided for him . 
10555	br-p01	19	75	216755	He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either . 
10556	br-p01	19	76	216777	To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep . 
10557	br-p01	20	77	216796	When he would be a man , he would be a rich_man . 
10558	br-p01	20	78	216809	He would not be like the `` rich Americans '' who lived in white columned houses on the other side of the park . 
10559	br-p01	20	79	216833	He would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning . 
10560	br-p01	20	80	216846	He would not carry a brief_case . 
10561	br-p01	20	81	216853	Nor would he work at_all . 
10562	br-p01	20	82	216859	He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step . 
10563	br-p01	20	83	216872	He would sit inside the coffee_shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling_out in her bowing , `` At your service '' . 
10564	br-p01	20	84	216912	He would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest_pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff - he would not remove his gloves - and light and smoke . 
10565	br-p01	20	85	216947	He could do that when he would be a man . 
10566	br-p01	21	86	216958	`` Hey , Laura '' ! he called to his sister on the porch above the steps . 
10567	br-p01	21	87	216976	She was only ten months older than he . 
10568	br-p01	21	88	216985	`` Laura , what would you say if I smoked a pipe '' ? 
10569	br-p01	22	89	216999	Laura did not answer him . 
10570	br-p01	22	90	217005	She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair in the sun . 
10571	br-p01	22	91	217026	One lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales . 
10572	br-p01	22	92	217042	Her tanned foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed artfully toward tapering toes - toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white . 
10573	br-p01	22	93	217068	All the while she sat there , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest . 
10574	br-p01	23	94	217083	Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii . 
10575	br-p01	23	95	217093	It was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours . 
10576	br-p01	23	96	217123	The eyes , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality . 
10577	br-p01	23	97	217137	Even_though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance . 
10578	br-p01	23	98	217153	He was never sure they fully took him in . 
10579	br-p01	24	99	217163	Pompeii called again , `` Laura '' ! 
10580	br-p01	24	100	217171	But the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it . 
10581	br-p01	25	101	217192	`` She 's in_a_mood '' , he thought `` There 's not a month she does n't get herself in_a_mood '' . 
10582	br-p01	26	102	217214	Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ? 
10583	br-p01	26	103	217233	And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him . 
10584	br-p01	26	104	217251	Not even Laura . 
10585	br-p01	27	105	217255	Suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat 's claret tongue , feasting against the salt taste of him . 
10586	br-p01	27	106	217296	Above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stared unfalteringly at him . 
10587	br-p01	28	107	217323	`` Christ_sake , goat , git '' ! 
10588	br-p01	28	108	217331	But the goat would not . 
10589	br-p01	29	109	217337	`` You 're boiling milk , ai n't you '' ? soothing it with his hand , knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch . 
10590	br-p01	29	110	217371	Pompeii rolled_over . 
10591	br-p01	29	111	217374	His head undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats . 
10592	br-p01	29	112	217396	With his mouth opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light , earthy taste of it . 
10593	br-p01	29	113	217426	The boy 's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did . 
10594	br-p01	30	114	217452	Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm_cloud . 
10595	br-p01	30	115	217462	Its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane . 
10596	br-p01	30	116	217473	But the boy could see only the goat 's belly . 
10597	br-p01	31	117	217484	The Old_Man near the corner let the shadow pass_over him , sensing something portentous in it . 
10598	br-p01	31	118	217501	He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he would n't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog 's back . 
10599	br-p01	31	119	217530	There would be time enough , perhaps the Old_Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due . 
10600	br-p01	31	120	217549	Time enough to give_up his soul . 
10601	br-p01	32	121	217556	In_the_meantime , six sandals , stained an ocher , the same color as Pompeii 's shaved hair , edged_up close to him . 
10602	br-p01	32	122	217579	The clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks . 
10603	br-p01	33	123	217615	He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta 's idiot brother . 
10604	br-p01	33	124	217646	Pompeii expected Romeo 's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground . 
10605	br-p01	33	125	217661	He expected Concetta 's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything . 
10606	br-r05	1	1	217698	Nothing in English has been ridiculed as_much_as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences . 
10607	br-r05	1	2	217720	Ben_Franklin said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr._Fogg . 
10608	br-r05	1	3	217729	You explain English by Greek '' . 
10609	br-r05	1	4	217736	Richard_Brinsley_Sheridan said , `` I think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two '' . 
10610	br-r05	1	5	217755	And a witty American journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` Many_a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can n't understand his own meaning '' . 
10611	br-r05	2	6	217793	There are many types of ambiguity and many_of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology , parisology , and other ologies . 
10612	br-r05	2	7	217819	In common parlance they would be described as misses - misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds . 
10613	br-r05	3	8	217838	One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition . 
10614	br-r05	3	9	217849	`` Did you or did you not say what I said you said , because Jane said you never said what I said '' ? 
10615	br-r05	4	10	217874	Another woman , addressing Christmas_cards , said to her husband : `` We sent them one last year but they did n't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they 'll think we won't send them one because they did n't last year , do n't you think , or shall we '' ? 
10616	br-r05	5	11	217935	Such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours . 
10617	br-r05	5	12	217959	Ambiguity of a non repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in . 
10618	br-r05	5	13	217974	`` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend . 
10619	br-r05	5	14	217985	`` I wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I did n't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind - and he seems to have misunderstood me '' . 
10620	br-r05	5	15	218024	Evidently Bill was another of those men who simply do n't understand women . 
10621	br-r05	6	16	218038	Another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped_up a politician . 
10622	br-r05	6	17	218049	`` Mr._Jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement . 
10623	br-r05	6	18	218072	Now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard_to it '' ? 
10624	br-r05	7	19	218089	Questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician . 
10625	br-r05	7	20	218111	They recall Byron 's classic comment : `` I wish he would explain his explanation '' . 
10626	br-r05	7	21	218128	Similarly , when a reporter once questioned Lincoln in cryptic fashion , Lincoln refused to make any further statement . 
10627	br-r05	7	22	218148	`` I fear explanations explanatory of things explained '' , he said , leaving the biter bit - and bitter . 
10628	br-r05	8	23	218169	The obscurity of politicians may_not always be as innocent as it looks . 
10629	br-r05	8	24	218182	`` Senator '' , said an interviewer , `` your constituents can n't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' . 
10630	br-r05	8	25	218210	`` Good '' ! 
10631	br-r05	8	26	218214	replied the Senator . 
10632	br-r05	8	27	218218	`` It took me five hours to write it that way '' . 
10633	br-r05	9	28	218231	The misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach . 
10634	br-r05	9	29	218249	This creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word . 
10635	br-r05	9	30	218270	A verse familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain : 
10636	br-r05	9	31	218280	`` I saw a man once beat his wife When on a drunken spree . 
10637	br-r05	9	32	218295	Now can you tell me who was drunk - The man , his wife , or me '' ? 
10638	br-r05	10	33	218314	The `` wooden-leg '' gag of vaudeville , another standby of this sort , had endless variations . 
10639	br-r05	11	34	218332	`` '' There 's a man outside with a wooden_leg named Smith `` . 
10640	br-r05	11	35	218346	'' What 's the name of his other leg `` '' ? 
10641	br-r05	12	36	218358	Another stock vaudeville gag ran : `` Mother is home sick in bed with the doctor '' . 
10642	br-r05	13	37	218376	When radio came_in , it continued the misplaced modifier in its routines as a standard device . 
10643	br-r05	14	38	218393	`` '' Do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on `` ? 
10644	br-r05	14	39	218411	'' I see the girl but I do n't see the car with slacks on `` '' . 
10645	br-r05	15	40	218429	In recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline . 
10646	br-r05	15	41	218453	In one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the doorman : `` Excuse me , but when we came_out we found that we had left my daughter 's handbag and my wife 's behind '' . 
10647	br-r05	16	42	218498	Journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips . 
10648	br-r05	16	43	218509	Not long_ago a newspaper advised those taking_part in a contest that `` snapshots must be of a person not larger than * * f inches '' . 
10649	br-r05	17	44	218536	Classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions . 
10650	br-r05	17	45	218545	Readers of the Reader_'s_Digest are familiar_with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips , like the ad in a California paper that advertised `` House for rent . 
10651	br-r05	17	46	218577	View takes_in five counties , two bedrooms '' . 
10652	br-r05	18	47	218586	Since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as_well as wit , newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples . 
10653	br-r05	18	48	218606	`` Officials Meet on Rubbish . 
10654	br-r05	18	49	218612	Many Shapes in Bathtubs . 
10655	br-r05	18	50	218617	Son and Daughter of Local Couple Married '' . 
10656	br-r05	19	51	218626	Apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese , journalism contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising matter . 
10657	br-r05	20	52	218648	A weekly newspaper reported a local romance : `` and the couple were married last Saturday , thus ending a friendship which began in their schooldays '' . 
10658	br-r05	21	53	218676	An item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a subscription , adding : `` I personally enjoy your newspaper as_much_as my husband '' . 
10659	br-r05	22	54	218702	Then there was the caterer 's ad which read : `` Are you getting_married or having an affair ? 
10660	br-r05	22	55	218721	We have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people '' . 
10661	br-r05	23	56	218731	The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical . 
10662	br-r05	23	57	218742	This slip is so-called because its semi ambiguous English always seems to refer to a person 's anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say . 
10663	br-r05	23	58	218770	Samples : 
10664	br-r05	23	59	218772	He walked in upon her invitation . 
10665	br-r05	23	60	218779	She kissed him passionately upon his reappearance . 
10666	br-r05	23	61	218787	He kissed her back . 
10667	br-r05	24	62	218792	Not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese . 
10668	br-r05	24	63	218804	In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs . 
10669	br-r05	24	64	218823	`` While Henry_Morgan was escorting Miss_Vera_Green from the church social last Saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit Mr._Morgan on the public_square '' . 
10670	br-r05	25	65	218850	Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie_star : `` The area in which Miss_N - was injured is spectacularly scenic '' . 
10671	br-r05	26	66	218878	The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of Weber and Fields . 
10672	br-r05	26	67	218900	When a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus , he replied , `` No , it was in the stomach '' . 
10673	br-r05	26	68	218930	Strangely_enough , this always brought_the_house_down . 
10674	br-r05	27	69	218936	Apart from journalese and vaudeville gags , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature . 
10675	br-r05	27	70	218952	A conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor . 
10676	br-r05	27	71	218962	Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor 's notes on an emergency case . 
10677	br-r05	27	72	218983	It read : `` Shot in the lumbar region '' . 
10678	br-r05	27	73	218994	After a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she typed into the record : `` Shot in the woods '' . 
10679	br-r05	28	74	219024	There are many grammatical misconstructions other_than dangling_modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations . 
10680	br-r05	28	75	219039	At the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving . 
10681	br-r05	28	76	219057	`` I want the fish served whole , with head and tail '' , the epicure explained , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth '' . 
10682	br-r05	28	77	219085	The maid demurred . 
10683	br-r05	28	78	219089	`` That 's silly - lemon in mouth '' , she said . 
10684	br-r05	28	79	219102	But since the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at_the_most fashionable dinners , the girl reluctantly agreed . 
10685	br-r05	28	80	219122	So she brought the fish in whole , and she carried a lemon in her mouth . 
10686	br-r05	29	81	219139	Another specimen of such double-entendre is illustrated by a woman in a department_store . 
10687	br-r05	29	82	219153	She said to the saleslady , `` I want a dress to put_on around the house '' . 
10688	br-r05	29	83	219171	The puzzled saleslady inquired , `` How large is your house , Madam '' ? 
10689	br-r05	30	84	219186	This saleslady was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department . 
10690	br-r05	30	85	219203	When a customer asked for alligator shoes , she said , `` What size is your alligator '' ? 
10691	br-r05	31	86	219222	The comic indefinite comprises an extensive class of comedy . 
10692	br-r05	31	87	219232	One species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person , place , time or thing . 
10693	br-r05	31	88	219255	A woman met a famous author at a literary tea . 
10694	br-r05	31	89	219266	`` Oh , I'm so delighted to meet you '' , she gushed . 
10695	br-r05	31	90	219280	`` It was only the other day that I saw something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine '' . 
10696	br-r05	32	91	219304	This baffling lack of distinct details recalls the secretary whose employer was leaving the office and told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence . 
10697	br-r05	32	92	219332	`` I may be back '' , he explained , `` and then_again , I may_not '' . 
10698	br-r05	32	93	219350	The girl nodded understandingly . 
10699	br-r05	32	94	219355	`` Yes , sir '' , she said , `` is that definite '' ? 
10700	br-r05	33	95	219370	An old-fashioned mother said to her modern daughter , `` You must have gotten_in quite late last night , dear . 
10701	br-r05	33	96	219391	Where were you '' ? 
10702	br-r05	33	97	219396	The daughter replied , `` Oh , I had dinner with - well , you do n't know him but he 's awfully nice - and we went_to a_couple_of places - I do n't suppose you 've heard of them - and we finished_up at a cute little night_club - I forget the name of it . 
10703	br-r05	33	98	219453	Why , it 's all_right , is n't it , Mother '' ? 
10704	br-r05	33	99	219466	Her woolly minded parent agreed . 
10705	br-r05	33	100	219472	`` Of_course , dear '' , she said . 
10706	br-r05	33	101	219481	`` It 's only that I like to know where you go '' . 
10707	br-r05	34	102	219495	No less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain clergyman 's sermon . 
10708	br-r05	34	103	219508	`` Dearly beloved '' , he preached , `` unless you repent of your sins in a measure , and become converted to a degree , you will , I regret to say , be damned to a more_or_less extent '' . 
10709	br-r05	34	104	219550	This clergyman should have referred to Shakespeare 's dictum : `` So-so is a good , very good , very excellent maxim . 
10710	br-r05	34	105	219573	And yet it is not . 
10711	br-r05	34	106	219579	It is but so-so '' . 
10712	br-r05	35	107	219585	Indefinite reference also carries double meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another . 
10713	br-r05	35	108	219605	A news item described the launching of a ship : `` Completing the ceremony , the beautiful movie_star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea '' . 
10714	br-r05	36	109	219643	This is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor_pool : `` Four trucks to Fort_Mason gym , 7 : 30 tonight , for hauling girls to dance . 
10715	br-r05	36	110	219676	The bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped_off '' . 
10716	br-r05	37	111	219686	A politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a minor public official who had just died . 
10717	br-r05	37	112	219706	`` What are my chances for taking Joe 's place '' ? he asked . 
10718	br-r05	37	113	219721	`` If you can fix it up with the undertaker '' , returned the politician , `` it 's all_right with me '' . 
10719	br-r05	38	114	219745	The manager of a movie_theater received a telephone_call from a woman who was equally indefinite . 
10720	br-r05	38	115	219761	`` What have you got_on today '' ? she inquired . 
10721	br-r05	38	116	219772	`` A blue suit '' , he answered . 
10722	br-r05	38	117	219781	`` Who 's in it '' ? she continued . 
10723	br-r05	38	118	219791	`` I am '' , he said . 
10724	br-r05	38	119	219799	There was a short pause for reflection . 
10725	br-r05	38	120	219807	`` Oh '' , said the woman , `` I 've seen that picture already '' . 
10726	br-r05	39	121	219824	Another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb . 
10727	br-r05	39	122	219839	When a question contains two verbs , the response does not make clear which of them is being answered . 
10728	br-r05	40	123	219859	The moonlit night was made_for romance , and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time . 
10729	br-r05	40	124	219878	Finally he asked , `` Do you object to petting '' ? 
10730	br-r05	40	125	219890	`` That 's one thing I 've never done '' , she said promptly . 
10731	br-r05	40	126	219905	He thought a moment , then inquired , `` You mean petted '' ? 
10732	br-r05	40	127	219919	`` No '' , she smiled , `` objected '' . 
10733	br-r05	41	128	219930	Replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre . 
10734	br-r05	41	129	219943	It would be hard to find anything more equivocal than : `` I cannot recommend him too highly '' . 
10735	br-r05	42	130	219963	Another less ambiguous case read as_follows : `` The bearer of_this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction . 
10736	br-r05	42	131	219986	If you are thinking_of giving him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one '' . 
10737	br-r05	43	132	220005	In the comedy of indefinite reference , it wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence . 
10738	br-r05	43	133	220024	Ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference . 
10739	br-r05	44	134	220035	Two friends were talking . 
10740	br-r05	44	135	220040	One said , `` When I get a cold I buy a bottle of whiskey for it , and within a_few hours it 's gone '' . 
10741	br-r05	44	136	220067	The speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold . 
10742	br-r05	45	137	220082	It wit is a misnomer because it covers slips as_well as wit . 
10743	br-r05	45	138	220095	An excited woman was making an emergency call over the phone : `` Doctor , please come over right_away . 
10744	br-r05	45	139	220115	My husband is in great pain . 
10745	br-r06	1	1	220122	I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves_Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic - his mother was_born in Ohio - who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson_Downs , raising_hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old_man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such_as human stature , hope , and humor . 
10746	br-r06	2	2	220194	My unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in_terms_of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . 
10747	br-r06	2	3	220229	After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . 
10748	br-r06	2	4	220285	A bee 's place is in the hive '' . 
10749	br-r06	3	5	220295	`` I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and_then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand . 
10750	br-r06	4	6	220335	`` I seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live . 
10751	br-r06	4	7	220363	Did you go_to their funeral '' ? 
10752	br-r06	5	8	220370	`` I was wrong '' , I admitted . 
10753	br-r06	5	9	220379	`` Comedy did n't die , it just went crazy . 
10754	br-r06	5	10	220390	It has identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate . 
10755	br-r06	5	11	220408	We now have not_only what has been called over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror jokes , magazines known as Horror_Comics , and sick comedians . 
10756	br-r06	5	12	220438	There are even publications called Sick and Mad . 
10757	br-r06	5	13	220447	The Zeitgeist is not crazy as a loon or mad as a March hare ; it is manic as a man '' . 
10758	br-r06	6	14	220470	`` I woke_up this morning '' , Moreland said , `` paraphrasing Lewis_Carroll . 
10759	br-r06	6	15	220484	Do you want to hear the paraphrase '' ? 
10760	br-r06	7	16	220493	`` Can I bear it '' ? 
10761	br-r06	7	17	220500	I asked , taking a final gulp of my drink , and handing him the empty glass . 
10762	br-r06	8	18	220518	`` Just barely '' , he said , and repeated his paraphrase : 
10763	br-r06	8	19	220531	`` The time has come '' , the walrus said , `` To speak of manic things , Of shots and shouts , and sealing dooms Of commoners and kings '' . 
10764	br-r06	9	20	220563	Moreland fixed us each another drink , and said , `` For God 's sake , tell me something truly amusing '' . 
10765	br-r06	10	21	220586	`` I 'll try '' , I said , and sat for a moment thinking . 
10766	br-r06	10	22	220602	`` Oh yes , the other day I reread some of Emerson 's English_Traits , and there was an anecdote about a group of English and Americans visiting Germany , more_than a_hundred years ago . 
10767	br-r06	10	23	220637	In the railway_station at Berlin , a uniformed attendant was chanting , ' Foreigners this way ! 
10768	br-r06	10	24	220654	Foreigners this way ' ! 
10769	br-r06	10	25	220659	One woman - she could have been either English or American - went_up to him and said , ' But you are the foreigners '' ' . 
10770	br-r06	10	26	220686	I took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink , and said , `` I admit that going back to Ralph_Waldo_Emerson for humor is like going_to a modern musical_comedy for music and comedy '' . 
10771	br-r06	11	27	220725	`` What 's the_matter with the music '' ? 
10772	br-r06	11	28	220734	Moreland asked . 
10773	br-r06	12	29	220737	`` It does n't drown_out the dialogue '' , I explained . 
10774	br-r06	13	30	220749	`` Let 's talk_about books '' , Moreland said . 
10775	br-r06	13	31	220759	`` I am told that in America you have non books by non writers , brought_out by non publishers for non readers . 
10776	br-r06	13	32	220782	Is it all non-fiction '' ? 
10777	br-r06	14	33	220788	`` There is non-fiction and non non-fiction '' , I said . 
10778	br-r06	14	34	220800	`` Speaking of nonism : the other day , in a story about a sit-down demonstration , the Paris_Herald_Tribune wrote , ' The non violence became noisier ' . 
10779	br-r06	14	35	220829	And_then Eichmann was quoted as saying , in non English , that Hitler 's plan to exterminate the Jews was nonsense '' . 
10780	br-r06	15	36	220852	`` If we cannot tell evil , horror , and insanity from nonsense , what is the future of humor and comedy '' ? 
10781	br-r06	15	37	220876	Moreland asked , grimly . 
10782	br-r06	16	38	220881	`` Cryptic '' , I said . 
10783	br-r06	16	39	220888	`` They require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these ? 
10784	br-r06	16	40	220910	In our present era of Science and Angst , the heart has been downgraded , to use one of our popular retrogressive verbs '' . 
10785	br-r06	17	41	220935	`` I know what you mean '' , Moreland sighed . 
10786	br-r06	17	42	220946	`` Last year your Tennessee_Williams told our Dilys_Powell , in a television_program , that it is the task of the playwright to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart . 
10787	br-r06	17	43	220979	Like almost everybody else , he confused the heart , both as organ and as symbol , with the disturbed psyche , the deranged glands , and the jumpy central_nervous_system . 
10788	br-r06	17	44	221010	I'm not pleading for the heart that leaps up when it beholds a rainbow in the sky , or for the heart that with rapture fills and dances with the daffodils . 
10789	br-r06	17	45	221042	The sentimental pure heart of Galahad is gone with the knightly years , but I still believe_in the heart of the George_Meredith character that was not made of the stuff that breaks '' . 
10790	br-r06	18	46	221076	`` We no_longer have Tom_Moore 's and Longfellow 's ' heart for any fate ' , either '' , I said . 
10791	br-r06	19	47	221098	`` Moore and Longfellow did n't have the fate that faces us '' , Moreland said . 
10792	br-r06	19	48	221115	`` One day our species promises co-existence , and the next day it threatens co_extinction '' . 
10793	br-r06	19	49	221132	We sat for_a_while drinking in silence . 
10794	br-r06	20	50	221139	`` The heart '' , I said finally , `` is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes . 
10795	br-r06	20	51	221165	When it was worn in the breast , or even on the sleeve , we at_least knew where it was '' . 
10796	br-r06	20	52	221187	There was a long silence . 
10797	br-r06	21	53	221193	`` You have visited England five times in the past quarter-century , I believe '' , my host said . 
10798	br-r06	21	54	221213	`` What has impressed you most on your present visit '' ? 
10799	br-r06	22	55	221225	`` I would say depressed , not impressed '' , I told him . 
10800	br-r06	22	56	221239	`` I should say it is the turning of courts of law into veritable theatres for sex dramas , involving clergymen and parishioners , psychiatrists and patients . 
10801	br-r06	22	57	221267	It is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political_arenas from the modern theatre '' . 
10802	br-r06	23	58	221285	`` Do you think we need a new Henry_James to re-explore the Anglo-American scene '' ? he asked . 
10803	br-r06	23	59	221304	`` Or perhaps a new Noel_Coward '' ? 
10804	br-r06	24	60	221312	`` But you must have heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent years of James and the antic heyday of Coward . 
10805	br-r06	24	61	221338	I myself hear it said constantly - in drawing-rooms . 
10806	br-r06	24	62	221348	In them , there is usually a group of Anglo-Americans with tragicomic problems , worthy of being explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire '' . 
10807	br-r06	24	63	221381	I stood_up and began pacing . 
10808	br-r06	25	64	221387	`` If you are trying to get us out of the brothel , the dustbin , the kitchen_sink , and the tawdry living-room , you are probably wasting your time '' , Moreland told me . 
10809	br-r06	25	65	221423	`` Too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock '' . 
10810	br-r06	26	66	221449	`` Furiouser and furiouser '' , I said . 
10811	br-r06	26	67	221458	`` I am worried about the current meanings of the word ' funny ' . 
10812	br-r06	26	68	221473	It now means ominous , as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor ; disturbing , as when one says that a friend is acting funny ; and frightening , as when a wife tells the police that it is funny , but her husband has n't been home for two days and nights '' . 
10813	br-r06	27	69	221532	Moreland sat brooding for a full minute , during which I made each of us a new drink . 
10814	br-r06	27	70	221551	He took his glass , clinked it against mine , and said , `` Toujours gai , what_the_hell '' ! borrowing a line from Don_Marquis ' Mehitabel . 
10815	br-r06	28	71	221579	`` Be careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergone a change . 
10816	br-r06	28	72	221599	It now means , in my country , homosexual '' , I said . 
10817	br-r06	28	73	221613	`` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny_house in the funny_wagon , he is removed to a mental_institution in an ambulance . 
10818	br-r06	28	74	221642	Recently , by_the_way , I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was non institutionalized '' . 
10819	br-r06	29	75	221664	My host went_over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; then he turned_to me . 
10820	br-r06	29	76	221681	`` Is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species '' ? 
10821	br-r06	30	77	221699	`` Oh , that is demonstrable '' , I told him . 
10822	br-r06	30	78	221711	`` Do you remember the woman in the French_Alps who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously ? 
10823	br-r06	30	79	221735	She told the sheep , ' The world is coming to an end ' ! 
10824	br-r06	30	80	221750	And the sheep said - all in_unison , I have no_doubt - ' Ba-a-a ' ! 
10825	br-r06	30	81	221766	The sound mockery of sheep is like the salubrious horse_laugh '' . 
10826	br-r06	31	82	221778	`` That is only partly non nonsense '' , he began . 
10827	br-r06	32	83	221790	`` If you saw the drama called Rhinoceros '' , I said , `` think_of the effect it would have on an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning_into a rhinoceros . 
10828	br-r06	32	84	221826	The rhinos would panic , screaming ' Help ' ! 
10829	br-r06	32	85	221836	- if that can be screamed in their language '' . 
10830	br-r06	33	86	221847	`` You think the Russians are getting_ahead of us in comedy '' ? 
10831	br-r06	33	87	221860	Moreland demanded . 
10832	br-r06	34	88	221863	`` Non-God , no '' , I said . 
10833	br-r06	34	89	221872	`` The political and intellectual Left began fighting humor and comedy years ago , because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage , such_as satire and irony , such_as humor and comedy . 
10834	br-r06	34	90	221908	Nevertheless , like any other human_being upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually , Khrushchev , the anti personality cultist , has become a comic actor , or thinks he has . 
10835	br-r06	34	91	221942	In his famous meeting with Nixon a_couple_of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as Ed_Wynn . 
10836	br-r06	34	92	221963	But , like Caesar , he has only one joke , so_far_as I can find_out . 
10837	br-r06	34	93	221979	It consists_in saying , ' That would be sending the goat to look_after the cabbage ' . 
10838	br-r06	34	94	221996	Why in the name_of_his_non-God does n't he vary it a_bit '' ? 
10839	br-r06	35	95	222008	`` Such_as '' ? 
10840	br-r06	35	96	222012	Moreland asked . 
10841	br-r06	36	97	222015	`` Such_as ' sending the cat to guard the mice ' , or ' the falcon to protect the dove ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human_being to save humanity '' ' . 
10842	br-r06	37	98	222053	`` You and I have fallen out of literature into politics '' , Moreland observed . 
10843	br-r06	38	99	222069	`` What a nasty fall was there '' ! 
10844	br-r06	38	100	222078	I said . 
10845	br-r06	39	101	222081	Moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again , and_then came_back and sat_down , restively . 
10846	br-r06	39	102	222098	`` The world that was once foot-loose and fancy-free '' , he said , `` has now become screw-loose and frenzy free . 
10847	br-r06	39	103	222121	In our age of Science and Angst it seems to me more brave to stay on Earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer_space '' . 
10848	br-r06	40	104	222157	`` The human ego being what it is '' , I put_in , `` science_fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a_thousand larger solar_systems than ours must look_like gigantic tube-nosed_fruit_bats . 
10849	br-r06	40	105	222192	It seems to me that the first human_being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species '' . 
10850	br-r06	41	106	222222	`` Now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again '' , Moreland protested . 
10851	br-r06	42	107	222237	`` Not in the largest sense of the words '' , I said . 
10852	br-r06	42	108	222251	`` The other day Arnold_Toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe_in the uniqueness of its religions , its ideologies , and its virtually everything else . 
10853	br-r06	42	109	222281	Why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else ? 
10854	br-r06	42	110	222301	Forty years ago an English writer , W._L._George , dealt with this subject in Eddies_of_the_Day , and said , as an example , that ' Saint_George for Merry_England ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' Strike frog eating Frenchmen dead '' ' ! 
10855	br-r06	43	111	222348	`` There was also Gott_strafe_Angleterre '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and Carthago_delenda_est , or if you will , Deus_strafe_Carthage . 
10856	br-r06	43	112	222370	It is n't what the ideologist believes_in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy . 
10857	br-r06	43	113	222390	This is the force , in our time and in every other time , that urges the paranoiac and the manic-depressive to become head of a state . 
10858	br-r06	43	114	222418	Complete power not_only corrupts but it also attracts the mad . 
10859	br-r06	43	115	222429	There is a bitter satire for a future writer in that '' . 
10860	br-r06	44	116	222442	`` Great satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable '' , I said . 
10861	br-r06	44	117	222458	`` But we now find writers obsessed by the nooks_and_crannies of their ivory_towers , and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry and non poetry . 
10862	br-r06	44	118	222487	I wrote a_few years ago that one of the cardinal rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about . 
10863	br-r07	1	1	222518	One day , the children had wanted to get_up onto General_Burnside 's horse . 
10864	br-r07	1	2	222532	They wanted to see what his back felt like - the General 's . 
10865	br-r07	1	3	222546	He looked so comfortable being straight . 
10866	br-r07	1	4	222553	They wanted to touch the mystery . 
10867	br-r07	1	5	222560	Arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came_by . 
10868	br-r07	2	6	222570	He was very rude . 
10869	br-r07	3	7	222575	Arlene had a hard voice , too , this time . 
10870	br-r07	3	8	222586	The policeman 's eyes rather popped for a second ; but then Arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` If it was n't for these dear children '' - . 
10871	br-r07	4	9	222622	The policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind_of politely , `` Now , look_here , lady : I know you got to entertain these kids and all . 
10872	br-r07	4	10	222659	But this is a public park and it 's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' . 
10873	br-r07	5	11	222680	Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' . 
10874	br-r07	6	12	222699	The policeman walked on , but he looked_back once . 
10875	br-r07	7	13	222709	That had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred . 
10876	br-r07	7	14	222723	Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; and they had told their mother about the tumbles . 
10877	br-r07	7	15	222749	In matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; and so they were consistently true to their principles . 
10878	br-r07	8	16	222773	`` Never_mind_'' , Arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual unco-operative course of grownups . 
10879	br-r07	8	17	222795	`` Never_mind . 
10880	br-r07	8	18	222798	I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' . 
10881	br-r07	9	19	222816	`` What is it '' ? asked the children , whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable . 
10882	br-r07	9	20	222838	Maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of Arlene . 
10883	br-r07	10	21	222853	`` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent British movie . 
10884	br-r07	11	22	222871	And when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time . 
10885	br-r07	11	23	222890	First , Arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults . 
10886	br-r07	11	24	222901	They had protested that that was n't any surprise . 
10887	br-r07	12	25	222911	`` Just you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement . 
10888	br-r07	12	26	222937	`` This is a warm-up '' . 
10889	br-r07	13	27	222944	`` Is it anything like cooked_over oatmeal '' ? asked one of the children . 
10890	br-r07	14	28	222959	`` Not the_least_bit '' , Arlene snapped . 
10891	br-r07	14	29	222967	One of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions . 
10892	br-r07	14	30	222995	Those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed_at loudest . 
10893	br-r07	14	31	223007	She would sometimes even get a_little hard on you , she took you so seriously . 
10894	br-r07	14	32	223023	But not hard for very long . 
10895	br-r07	14	33	223030	Just long enough to make you feel important . 
10896	br-r07	15	34	223039	`` Now '' , said Arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live_oak , the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms sag_down and feel comfortable . 
10897	br-r07	15	35	223078	`` Now , we 're going_to be like what General_Burnside and his horse make us think_of '' . 
10898	br-r07	16	36	223096	The children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever . 
10899	br-r07	16	37	223113	Their curiosity went happily out_of_bounds . 
10900	br-r07	17	38	223119	Then , Arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful . 
10901	br-r07	17	39	223135	She held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked . 
10902	br-r07	17	40	223151	`` Imagine being able to laugh and wink when you 're like the top part of that picture_frame at home '' , one of them said . 
10903	br-r07	17	41	223178	They both laughed and winked back . 
10904	br-r07	18	42	223185	`` I'm General_Burnside 's horse , upside_down '' , Arlene said , sort_of gaspingly , for her : even she had to breathe kind_of funny when she was in that position . 
10905	br-r07	18	43	223217	She made General_Burnside 's horse 's belly do so funny when it was upside_down . 
10906	br-r07	18	44	223232	Then , she was back on her feet , winking and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling ) . 
10907	br-r07	18	45	223270	And she would wink and throw kisses . 
10908	br-r07	18	46	223278	They both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long_time , but it made their lips and eyelids tremble . 
10909	br-r07	18	47	223299	But they kept_on clapping for a long , long time . 
10910	br-r07	19	48	223310	`` This time '' , Arlene said , and she even kept_on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking , `` you 're going_to tell me what I am and what I'm doing . 
10911	br-r07	19	49	223346	It all has something to do with General_Burnside and his horse '' . 
10912	br-r07	20	50	223359	This time , it was so grand ; they could tell exactly what it was . 
10913	br-r07	20	51	223375	It was General_Burnside 's horse running in a circle . 
10914	br-r07	20	52	223385	His legs shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders . 
10915	br-r07	20	53	223405	`` That 's the General 's horse '' , one of them cried_out . 
10916	br-r07	21	54	223419	The other remarked , in a happy laughter , `` That 's a funny old horse '' . 
10917	br-r07	22	55	223437	The first one said , `` He sure does shake . 
10918	br-r07	22	56	223448	He 's old '' . 
10919	br-r07	23	57	223453	Then there was the General kissing his wife . 
10920	br-r07	23	58	223462	They had to be told that one . 
10921	br-r07	23	59	223470	But it was even funnier after they had been told . 
10922	br-r07	23	60	223481	Their father , when he came_back from those many business trips , just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric icebox . 
10923	br-r07	23	61	223521	But not General_Burnside . 
10924	br-r07	23	62	223525	He was the funniest man . 
10925	br-r07	23	63	223531	He never could keep still , even when he did n't move his feet . 
10926	br-r07	24	64	223546	Then , they had to get_up and be General_Burnside . 
10927	br-r07	24	65	223556	Or his horse . 
10928	br-r07	24	66	223560	All they could think_of was to run_around in circles , kicking their legs out . 
10929	br-r07	24	67	223575	It was n't very funny . 
10930	br-r07	24	68	223581	Then , they said General_Burnside was going_to jump over his horse 's head ; and they did some somersaults . 
10931	br-r07	24	69	223601	But that was n't very funny , either . 
10932	br-r07	25	70	223610	`` You ought to shake '' , Arlene advised them . 
10933	br-r07	25	71	223621	And Arlene showed them how to begin . 
10934	br-r07	25	72	223629	She also taught them to sing `` I wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate '' . 
10935	br-r07	25	73	223647	That helped a_lot . 
10936	br-r07	25	74	223651	They were clumsy , but they were beginning to catch_on . 
10937	br-r07	25	75	223662	They also caught_on a little bit on how to smile a_lot without your lips trembling . 
10938	br-r07	25	76	223678	`` Imagine you won't get your allowance if you 're caught not smiling - or smiling with your lips trembling too_much '' , Arlene suggested . 
10939	br-r07	26	77	223704	That helped a_great_deal . 
10940	br-r07	27	78	223708	They were a_little late in getting home . 
10941	br-r07	28	79	223716	`` I'm sorry , Mrs._Minks '' , Arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it . 
10942	br-r07	29	80	223736	My mother constituted herself the voice of all_of us . 
10943	br-r07	29	81	223746	`` It 's perfectly understandable , Arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way . 
10944	br-r07	29	82	223763	`` I suppose you all were playing and forgot '' ? 
10945	br-r07	30	83	223774	`` Yes , ma'am '' , the children chorused heartily . 
10946	br-r07	31	84	223785	We could n't help laughing . 
10947	br-r07	32	85	223791	The children rushed_off to get_rid_of their sweaters ; and Arlene began tapping the kitchen door open . 
10948	br-r07	32	86	223808	`` Arlene 's a good girl '' , my uncle remarked to us ; but he said it too_soon , for it came_out just before the tap to which the door responded . 
10949	br-r07	32	87	223841	That tap had a slight bang ish quality . 
10950	br-r07	33	88	223850	`` She really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed . 
10951	br-r07	33	89	223864	Her upper lip lifted slightly . 
10952	br-r07	33	90	223870	She was biting into a small red radish ; and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing . 
10953	br-r07	33	91	223896	Also , she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled_up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish . 
10954	br-r07	33	92	223924	She would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting . 
10955	br-r07	33	93	223948	It never worked , naturally ; but it made her look unusual . 
10956	br-r07	33	94	223961	Also , when she had bitten_off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable ; and she would snatch the finger held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it . 
10957	br-r07	33	95	223998	One could hear a very faint , ladylike sigh of relief . 
10958	br-r07	33	96	224010	Actually , it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it . 
10959	br-r07	33	97	224021	But the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public . 
10960	br-r07	34	98	224036	Later_on , the children told her further about somersaulting . 
10961	br-r07	34	99	224046	`` It must be awfully good for them . 
10962	br-r07	34	100	224055	And awfully kind of Arlene '' , she told us later . 
10963	br-r07	34	101	224067	`` But do you know something curious '' ? she added . 
10964	br-r07	34	102	224079	`` I reached_into that funny little pocket that is high_up on my dress . 
10965	br-r07	34	103	224093	I have no notion why I reached . 
10966	br-r07	34	104	224101	And I found a radish . 
10967	br-r07	34	105	224107	Was it an omen ? 
10968	br-r07	34	106	224112	I thought for a second . 
10969	br-r07	34	107	224118	But I would not pamper myself in that silly way . 
10970	br-r07	34	108	224129	I opened the window and threw the radish out '' . 
10971	br-r07	35	109	224140	Then , my mother blushed at this small lie ; for she knew and we knew that it was cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain . 
10972	br-r07	36	110	224174	Arlene became indispensable ; nobody could have told why . 
10973	br-r07	36	111	224184	But she was . 
10974	br-r07	36	112	224188	It was in_the_air . 
10975	br-r07	37	113	224192	A friend of my father 's came to dinner . 
10976	br-r07	37	114	224202	He was passing_through town and phoned to say hello . 
10977	br-r07	37	115	224212	As a result , he was persuaded out to dinner . 
10978	br-r07	37	116	224223	As_a_matter_of_fact , this happened every four or five months . 
10979	br-r07	37	117	224233	Sometimes , he coincided with my father 's being at home . 
10980	br-r07	37	118	224245	Sometimes , as at this juncture , he did not . 
10981	br-r07	37	119	224256	But he was always persuaded out . 
10982	br-r07	38	120	224263	he liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; the two youngest in our family always had to be brought_in and put_through tricks for his entertainment . 
10983	br-r07	38	121	224292	When he had left , I could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index_finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . 
10984	br-r07	38	122	224341	The children loathed him , too . 
10985	br-r07	39	123	224348	This_evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds_and_ends of dessert distributed over them . 
10986	br-r07	39	124	224367	There had been some coconut in it , for I remember my mother 's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and_then putting_down her radish with a shiver . 
10987	br-r07	40	125	224407	They were pushed gently into the room by Arlene - whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door . 
10988	br-r07	40	126	224436	We had just sat_down . 
10989	br-r07	41	127	224441	`` Tell Mr._Gorboduc what you 're doing these days '' , my mother advised the children , ceremonially . 
10990	br-r07	42	128	224460	There was an air of revolt about the children - even irreverence for their own principles . 
10991	br-r07	42	129	224477	This could be told chiefly from a sort of head tossing and prancing , a horse like balkiness of demeanor . 
10992	br-r07	42	130	224498	Possibly , the coconut containing dessert had brought_up bitter problems of administration . 
10993	br-r07	42	131	224511	But , at the beginning , this stayed just in_the_air . 
10994	br-r07	43	132	224522	`` We go_to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them said . 
10995	br-r07	43	133	224538	`` We have good times '' . 
10996	br-r07	44	134	224545	This happy bulletin convulsed Mr._Gorboduc . 
10997	br-r07	44	135	224551	`` You do '' ? he asked , between wheezes of laughter . 
10998	br-r07	44	136	224564	He was forced to wipe his eyes . 
10999	br-r07	44	137	224572	`` You do n't step on the flowers , do you ? 
11000	br-r07	44	138	224584	Eh '' ? 
11001	br-r07	45	139	224587	One of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index_finger . 
11002	br-r07	46	140	224600	`` No '' , he said . 
11003	br-r07	46	141	224607	`` We do n't '' . 
11004	br-r07	47	142	224613	Mr._Gorboduc took a swig of his sherry . 
11005	br-r07	47	143	224621	He was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs . 
11006	br-r07	47	144	224638	Usually , this was done when attention was diverted by someone else 's long , boring story . 
11007	br-r07	47	145	224656	But this time she was nervous : she was open . 
11008	br-r07	48	146	224667	Mr._Gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again . 
11009	br-r07	48	147	224677	`` Tell me - what do you do at the park '' ? he asked . 
11010	br-r07	48	148	224693	This was delivered in a forthright way , without coyness and over pretended interest - an admirable way with children . 
11011	br-r07	48	149	224714	Only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command . 
11012	br-r07	48	150	224733	This nettled the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment . 
11013	br-r07	49	151	224767	`` We bump '' , one said ; and the other went_on to development of the idea . 
11014	br-r07	49	152	224785	`` We grind , too '' , he said . 
11015	br-r07	50	153	224795	My mother was beside_herself with curiosity . 
11016	br-r07	50	154	224802	`` Say that again '' , she pleaded . 
11017	br-r07	50	155	224811	She laughed a_little and tossed the dregs rakishly around in her glass . 
11018	br-r07	50	156	224824	`` You what '' ? 
11019	br-r07	50	157	224829	She could see that Mr._Gorboduc was intrigued ; the hostess in her took_over . 
11020	br-r07	50	158	224843	She was rollickingly happy . 
11021	br-r07	50	159	224848	`` You what '' ? 
11022	br-r07	51	160	224853	My uncle looked at Mr._Gorboduc . 
11023	br-r07	51	161	224859	He read Henry_James and used_to pretend profundity through eye-beamings at people . 
11024	br-r07	52	162	224871	Mr._Gorboduc looked down . 
11025	br-r07	52	163	224875	He would not look up . 
11026	br-r07	52	164	224881	He was very funny about the whole_thing . 
11027	br-r08	1	1	224889	Pueri_Aquam_De_Silvas_Ad_Agricolas_Portant , a delightful vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre Punic_War Rome . 
11028	br-r08	1	2	224904	Marcellus , the hero , is beset from all sides by the problems of approaching manhood . 
11029	br-r08	1	3	224921	The story opens on the eve of his fifty-third birthday , as he prepares_for the two_weeks of festivities that are to follow . 
11030	br-r08	1	4	224944	Suddenly , a messenger arrives and , just before collapsing dead at his feet , informs him that the Saracens have invaded Silesia , the home province of his affianced . 
11031	br-r08	1	5	224975	He at_once cancels the celebrations and , buckling on his scimitar , stumbles blindly from the house , where he is hit and killed by a passing oxcart . 
11032	br-r08	2	6	225004	The Albany_Civic_Opera 's presentation of Spumoni 's immortal Il_Sevigli_del_Spegititgninino , with guest contralto Hattie_Sforzt . 
11033	br-r08	2	7	225019	An unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering of the classic myth that involves the rescue of Prometheus from the rock by the U.S._Cavalry was given last week in the warehouse of the Albany_Leather_Conduit_Company amid cheers of `` Hubba hubba '' and `` Yalagaloo pip pip '' ! 
11034	br-r08	3	8	225067	After a `` busy '' overture , the curtain rises on a farm scene - the Ranavan_Valley in northern Maine . 
11035	br-r08	3	9	225088	A dead armadillo , the sole occupant of the stage , symbolizes the crisis and destruction of the Old_Order . 
11036	br-r08	3	10	225108	Old_Order , acted and atonally sung by Grunnfeu_Arapacis , the lovely Serbantian import , then entered and delivered the well-known invocation to the god Phineoppus , whereupon the stage is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering Gorshek priests , symbolizing Love , Lust , Prudence and General_Motors , respectively . 
11037	br-r08	3	11	225160	According to the myth , Old_Order then vanishes at stage_left and reappears at extreme stage_right , but director Shuz skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage_effects by simply having Miss_Arapacis walk across the stage . 
11038	br-r08	3	12	225196	The night we saw it , a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the armadillo , complaining - in ad-lib - that `` it smelled '' . 
11039	br-r08	3	13	225227	We caught the early train to New_York . 
11040	br-r08	4	14	225235	The Dharma_Dictionary , a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with Eurasian proto-senility cults . 
11041	br-r08	4	15	225252	It 's somewhat off_the_beaten_track , to_be_sure , but therein lies its variety and charm . 
11042	br-r08	4	16	225267	For_example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate . 
11043	br-r08	4	17	225298	Likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen '' all originated_in the same village in Bathar-on-Walli_Province and are all used to express sentiments concerning British `` imperialism '' . 
11044	br-r08	4	18	225346	The terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spouting them to your date , it might be best to find_out if he was a member of Major_Pockmanster 's Delhi_Regiment , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in_that outfit . 
11045	br-r08	5	19	225398	The_Breeze_And_Chancellor_Neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to woo a plaster_cast of the Apollo_Belvedere . 
11046	br-r08	5	20	225420	As you have doubtless guessed already , the plot is plastered with Freudian , Jungian , and Meinckian theory . 
11047	br-r08	5	21	225440	For_example , when the film is only four minutes old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano_stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano_stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of_course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed_through middle Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina ) . 
11048	br-r08	5	22	225508	For the remainder of the movie , Chancellor_Neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano_stool with a slat from a Venetian_blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag . 
11049	br-r08	5	23	225536	In this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt_pangs caused by his personal assaults against the_English at Dunkirk . 
11050	br-r08	5	24	225560	As we find_out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolizing Doris , therefore the_English ) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian_blind . 
11051	br-r08	5	25	225589	And , when the slat finally shatters , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` He loves me , he loves me not '' . 
11052	br-r08	5	26	225620	After a_few tortuous moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that Neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in_the_eyes_of a mute piece of sculpture . 
11053	br-r08	5	27	225660	The effect , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at_times a_bit obscure , the film is certainly a much needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' movie-goer . 
11054	br-r08	6	28	225692	THE MUSIC OF BINI_SALFININISTAS , CAPITAL_LP 63711 - R , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer . 
11055	br-r08	6	29	225716	Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov_Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay_dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed_through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . 
11056	br-r08	6	30	225781	But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc_Schlek_, Jr. , a major revival is under_way . 
11057	br-r08	6	31	225800	As he leads the Neurenschatz_Skolkau_Orchestra , Schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor 's insistence . 
11058	br-r08	6	32	225835	A major portion of the credit should also go to flautist Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis '' movement in the Baslot . 
11059	br-r08	6	33	225862	Not_only was Haumd 's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in_stride . 
11060	br-r08	6	34	225882	For_example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest F major register up_to a barely audible N minor in four seconds , not skipping , at_the_same_time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist 's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage . 
11061	br-r08	6	35	225944	We would have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain_from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it mars an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance . 
11062	br-r08	6	36	225983	As Broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted_down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas , the American theatre is going_through an inexorable renaissance in_that nebulous area known_as `` off-Broadway '' . 
11063	br-r08	6	37	226018	For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . 
11064	br-r08	6	38	226053	The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho 's classic frog haiku by Roger_Entwhistle , a former University_of_Maryland chemistry instructor . 
11065	br-r08	6	39	226084	Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . 
11066	br-r08	6	40	226132	The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . 
11067	br-r08	6	41	226164	They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor . 
11068	br-r08	6	42	226184	The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue_pie , gets a plate of English_muffins instead . 
11069	br-r08	6	43	226217	Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks_Atkinson retired . 
11070	br-r08	7	44	226279	Aging but still precocious , French feline enfant_terrible Francoisette_Lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called The_Lascivious_Interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in_love with a middle-aged steam_shovel . 
11071	br-r08	7	45	226323	A biting , pithy parable of the all pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by Mlle_Lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over_and_over by four thousand French_horns ) by existentialist hot-shot Jean-Paul_Sartre . 
11072	br-r08	7	46	226364	Petite , lovely Yvette_Chadroe plays the nymphomaniac engagingly . 
11073	br-r08	8	47	226373	Ever since Bambi , and , more recently , Born_Free , there have been a_lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max_Fink 's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable My_Friend_, the Quizzical_Salamander . 
11074	br-r08	8	48	226412	Done in the modern style of a `` confession '' , Fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother 's pet salamander , Alicia . 
11075	br-r08	8	49	226448	It is not an entirely happy book , as Mrs._Fink soon becomes jealous of Alicia and , in retaliation , refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass . 
11076	br-r08	8	50	226479	Max , in a fit of despair , takes Alicia and runs_off for two marvelous weeks in Burbank ( Fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which Alicia tragically contracts Parkinson's_disease and dies . 
11077	br-r08	8	51	226528	This brief resume hardly does the book justice , but I heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems of our time . 
11078	br-r08	9	52	226556	Opera in the Grand_Tradition , along with mah-jongg , seems to be staging a well deserved comeback . 
11079	br-r08	9	53	226574	In this country , the two guiding_lights are , without_doubt , Felix_Fing and Anna_Pulova . 
11080	br-r08	9	54	226589	Fing , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman of the old_school who was once mistaken on the street for Sir_Cedric_Hardwicke , is responsible_for the rediscovery of Verdi 's earliest , most raucous opera , Nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent_of the Mudugno version of `` Volare '' . 
11081	br-r08	9	55	226648	Miss_Pulova has a voice that Maria_Callas once described as `` like chipping teeth with a screw_driver '' , and her round , opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of Rosalie . 
11082	br-r08	10	56	226685	The Champs_Elysees is literally littered this summer with the prostrate bodies of France 's beat-up beatnik jeunes_filles . 
11083	br-r08	10	57	226703	Cause of all this commotion : squat , pug-nosed , balding , hopelessly ugly Jean-Pierre_Bravado , a Bogartian figure , who plays a sadistic , amoral , philosophic Tasti-Freeze salesman in old New-Waver Fredrico_de_Mille_Rossilini 's endlessly provocative film , A_Sour_Sponge . 
11084	br-r08	10	58	226744	Bravado has been alternately described as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of France and myself '' ( De_Gaulle ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob '' ! 
11085	br-r08	10	59	226774	( Norman_Mailer ) , but no one can deny that the screen crackles with electricity whenever he is on it . 
11086	br-r08	10	60	226795	Soaring to stardom along with him , Margo_Felicity_Brighetti , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling Italian starlet , turns_in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic . 
11087	br-r08	11	61	226821	The battle of the drib-drool continues , but most of New_York 's knowing sophisticates of Abstract_Expressionism are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of V ( for Vindication ) Day , September first , when Augustus_Quasimodo 's first one-man show opens at the Guggenheim . 
11088	br-r08	11	62	226866	We have heard that after seeing Mr._Quasimodo 's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . 
11089	br-r08	11	63	226893	And it is thought by many who think_about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De_Kooning . 
11090	br-r08	11	64	226934	Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' . 
11091	br-r08	12	65	226950	`` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to Franz_Kline and myself , `` the nothing that_is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non time '' . 
11092	br-r08	12	66	227005	It is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The_Invasion_of_Cuba '' . 
11093	br-r08	12	67	227030	In this work , his use of non color is startling and skillful . 
11094	br-r08	12	68	227044	The sweep of space , the delicate counterbalance of the white masses , the over-all completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece . 
11095	br-r08	12	69	227078	I asked Quasimodo recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and_then had her breathe on the canvas '' , which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity . 
11096	br-r09	1	1	227126	Dear Sirs : Let me begin by clearing_up any possible misconception in your minds , wherever you are . 
11097	br-r09	1	2	227145	The collective by which I address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in_use among professional thieves . 
11098	br-r09	1	3	227171	It is , I am reliably given to understand , the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost ; i.e. , burglars who rob while the tenants are absent , in contrast to hot slough prowlers , those who work while the occupants are home . 
11099	br-r09	1	4	227223	Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior . 
11100	br-r09	1	5	227248	Far from it ; I merely draw an etymological distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman . 
11101	br-r09	1	6	227275	Above_all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a_few objets_d'art , or to shame you into rectitude . 
11102	br-r09	1	7	227311	My object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict . 
11103	br-r09	1	8	227346	You have unwittingly set_in_motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . 
11104	br-r09	1	9	227372	Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be_in_your_shoes for all the rice in China . 
11105	br-r09	2	10	227388	As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . 
11106	br-r09	2	11	227410	Sometime on Saturday evening , August 22nd , while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria_dell_'Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks_County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . 
11107	br-r09	2	12	227451	Hastening to the attic , the temperature of_which was easily hotter than the Gold_Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the_like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there . 
11108	br-r09	2	13	227496	What you were looking_for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis_rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph_records scattered about a fumed_oak Victrola , you danced two tangos and a paso_doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu . 
11109	br-r09	2	14	227546	You then descended one story , glommed a television_set from the music room - the only constructive feature of your visit , by_the_way - and , returning to the ground_floor , entered the master_bedroom . 
11110	br-r09	2	15	227581	From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade handled magnifying_glass . 
11111	br-r09	2	16	227621	Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby , you unearthed an antique French chess_set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box_Kodaks , you added to your haul . 
11112	br-r09	2	17	227653	Then , having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on , you lammed out the front_door , considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover . 
11113	br-r09	3	18	227683	So_much_for the tiresome facts , as familiar to you , I'm sure , as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake . 
11114	br-r09	3	19	227709	The foregoing , aided by several clues I 'll withhold to keep you on_your_toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector_Javert , but before they close_in , gird yourselves , I repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless . 
11115	br-r09	3	20	227752	Fourteen of the sculptures you took posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls_out in patches . 
11116	br-r09	3	21	227785	In_time , these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia , the king's_evil , sheep_rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry_out_for release . 
11117	br-r09	3	22	227821	All this , though , is simply a prelude , a curtain-raiser , for what ensues , and I doubt whether any Occidental could accurately forecast it . 
11118	br-r09	3	23	227849	If , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , I can delimit the powers of a_few of the divinities you 've affronted and describe the punishment they meted_out in one analogous instance . 
11119	br-r09	3	24	227885	Hold_on tight . 
11120	br-r09	4	25	227888	First_of_all , the six figures of the Buddha you heisted - four Siamese heads , a black obsidian statuette in the earth touching position , and a large brass figure of the Dying_Buddha on a teakwood base . 
11121	br-r09	4	26	227926	Now , you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord_Buddha is the most compassionate of the gods , much more so than Jehovah and Allah and the rest . 
11122	br-r09	4	27	227957	' Fess up - do n't you ? 
11123	br-r09	4	28	227965	Well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the Wheel_of_the_Law specifies ) toward impious folk who steal , disturb , or maltreat the Presence . 
11124	br-r09	4	29	227991	Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers . 
11125	br-r09	4	30	228001	Eight or ten years ago , a_couple_of French hoods stole a priceless Khmer head from the Musee_Guimet , in Paris , and a week later crawled into the Salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy . 
11126	br-r09	4	31	228036	Hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra_oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed_One to forgive their desecration . 
11127	br-r09	4	32	228063	Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I 'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for_the_moment , let 's resume our catalogue . 
11128	br-r09	5	33	228100	Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead , as a dealer in Khartoum assured me , I am not competent to say . 
11129	br-r09	5	34	228135	Likewise the ivory Chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance Honan ) ; a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack . 
11130	br-r09	5	35	228183	The three Indian brass deities , though - Ganessa , Siva , and Krishna - are an altogether different cup_of_tea . 
11131	br-r09	5	36	228204	They hail from Travancore , a state in the subcontinent where Kali , the goddess of death , is worshiped . 
11132	br-r09	5	37	228225	Have you ever heard of thuggee ? 
11133	br-r09	5	38	228232	Nuf sed . 
11134	br-r09	5	39	228235	But it is the wooden sculpture from Bali , the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish , that I particularly call to your attention . 
11135	br-r09	5	40	228270	Oddly_enough , this is an amulet against housebreakers , presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949 . 
11136	br-r09	5	41	228292	Inscribed around its base is a charm in Balinese , a dialect I take it you do n't comprehend . 
11137	br-r09	5	42	228312	Neither do I , but the Tjokorda_Agoeng was good enough to translate , and I 'll do as much for you . 
11138	br-r09	5	43	228334	Whosoever violates our rooftree , the legend states , can expect maximal sorrow . 
11139	br-r09	5	44	228348	The teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles , his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers , and a trolley_car will grow in his stomach . 
11140	br-r09	5	45	228376	Furthermore - and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note - it shall avail the vandals naught to throw_away or dispose of their loot . 
11141	br-r09	5	46	228404	The cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation . 
11142	br-r09	5	47	228426	Sort_of remorseless , is n't it ? 
11143	br-r09	5	48	228433	Still , there it is . 
11144	br-r09	6	49	228439	Now , you no_doubt regard the preceding as pap ; you 're tooling_around full of gage in your hot_rods , gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like Ubermenschen . 
11145	br-r09	6	50	228475	In that case , listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled_with our joss . 
11146	br-r09	6	51	228490	A_couple_of years back , I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a `` coffin turn '' . 
11147	br-r09	6	52	228514	In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked_up in Bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a_few pennies in its lap . 
11148	br-r09	6	53	228550	After a while , we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it . 
11149	br-r09	6	54	228569	Our suspicions eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a grocer 's boy , a thoroughly bad_hat , who delivered cartons to the people overhead . 
11150	br-r09	6	55	228598	The more I probed into this young_man 's activities and character , the less savory I found him . 
11151	br-r09	6	56	228617	I learned , for_example , that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet . 
11152	br-r09	6	57	228650	His energy was prodigious ; sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage_collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx_Zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar_butts against their paws . 
11153	br-r09	6	58	228695	Evenings , he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like Enrico + Paglieri's or Peter's_Backyard drunkenly donning ladies ' hats and singing `` O_Sole_Mio '' . 
11154	br-r09	6	59	228722	In_short , and to borrow an arboreal phrase , slash_timber . 
11155	br-r09	6	60	228733	Well , the odious little toad went_along chivying animals and humans who could n't retaliate , and in_due_course , as was inevitable , overreached himself . 
11156	br-r09	6	61	228759	One morning , we discovered not_only that the pennies were missing from the idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed_out in its lap . 
11157	br-r09	6	62	228784	`` Now he 's bought_it '' , said my wife contentedly . 
11158	br-r09	6	63	228796	`` No divinity will hold_still_for that . 
11159	br-r09	6	64	228803	He 's really asking for it '' . 
11160	br-r09	6	65	228811	And how right she was . 
11161	br-r09	6	66	228817	The next time we saw him , he was a changed person ; he had aged thirty years , and his face , the color of tallow , was crisscrossed with wrinkles , as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire . 
11162	br-r09	6	67	228860	Some sort_of nemesis was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a quavering voice - either an ape specter or Abe_Spector , a process_server , we could n't determine which . 
11163	br-r09	6	68	228892	His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr._Grimesby_Roylott 's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band . 
11164	br-r09	6	69	228916	The grocery the youth worked for soon tired_of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go . 
11165	br-r09	6	70	228947	The beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off . 
11166	br-r09	6	71	228969	Reduced to beggary , he at_last got a job as office_boy to a television producer . 
11167	br-r09	6	72	228985	His hubris , deficiency of taste , and sadism carried him straightaway to the top . 
11168	br-r09	6	73	229001	He evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks , and quickly superseded his boss . 
11169	br-r09	6	74	229021	Not long_ago , I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio_City ; he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at_once , clearly a man in_extremis . 
11170	br-r09	6	75	229055	`` See that guy '' ? the operator asked pityingly . 
11171	br-r09	6	76	229066	`` I would n't be_in_his_shoes for all the rice in China . 
11172	br-r09	6	77	229078	There 's some kind_of a nemesis haunting his footsteps '' . 
11173	br-r09	7	78	229089	However one looks_at it , therefore , I 'd say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy . 
11174	br-r09	7	79	229111	The inventory you acquired from me is n't going_to be easy to move ; you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva . 
11175	br-r09	7	80	229147	Additionally , since you 're going_to be hors_de_combat pretty soon with sprue , yaws , Delhi_boil , the Granville_wilt , liver_fluke , bilharziasis , and a host of other complications of the hex you 've aroused , you must n't expect to be lionized socially . 
11176	br-r09	7	81	229193	My advice , if you live long enough to continue your vocation , is that the next time you 're attracted by the exotic , pass it up - it 's nothing but a headache . 
11177	br-r09	7	82	229229	As you can count_on me to do the same . 
11178	br-r09	8	83	229239	compassionately yours , 
11179	br-r09	9	84	229242	S._J._Perelman . 
11180	br-r09	10	85	229244	The doors of the D train slid shut , and as I dropped into a seat and , exhaling , looked up across the aisle , the whole aviary in my head burst into song . 
11181	br-r09	10	86	229280	She was a living doll and no mistake - the blue-black bang , the wide cheekbones , olive flushed , that betrayed the Cherokee strain in her Midwestern lineage , and the mouth whose only fault , in the novelist 's carping phrase , was that the lower lip was a_trifle too voluptuous . 
11182	br-r09	10	87	229334	From what I was able to gauge in a swift , greedy glance , the figure inside the coral colored boucle dress was stupefying . 
11183	br-e22	1	1	229359	Your invitation to write_about Serge_Prokofieff to honor his 70_th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya_Muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because I admire the music of Prokofieff ; and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics . 
11184	br-e22	2	2	229412	The Serge_Prokofieff whom we knew in the United_States_of_America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur - and very capable as a professional musician . 
11185	br-e22	2	3	229441	These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post World_War_1 , era . 
11186	br-e22	2	4	229467	Prokofieff 's outlook as a composer pianist conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant . 
11187	br-e22	3	5	229483	Prokofieff 's Classical_Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well trained musician still in his twenties . 
11188	br-e22	3	6	229505	To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; to the Neo Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world . 
11189	br-e22	3	7	229531	What was it to Prokofieff ? 
11190	br-e22	3	8	229537	A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18_th Century ideas ; a trial_balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; a brilliant piece_de_resistance ? 
11191	br-e22	3	9	229560	Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon . 
11192	br-e22	4	10	229573	I heard the Classical_Symphony for_the_first_time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927 . 
11193	br-e22	4	11	229587	All musical Paris was there . 
11194	br-e22	4	12	229593	Some musicians were enthusiastic , some skeptical . 
11195	br-e22	4	13	229601	I myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) . 
11196	br-e22	4	14	229614	I remember Ernest_Bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour_de_force , mais_mon_Dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? 
11197	br-e22	5	15	229644	The answer is , `` Yes '' ! 
11198	br-e22	5	16	229652	Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical_Symphony seriously , and with a good_deal of pleasure . 
11199	br-e22	5	17	229669	His life-long friend , Serge_Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New_York , and Washington , D._C. , to_which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation . 
11200	br-e22	5	18	229704	Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world_premiere of the Love_for_Three_Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third_Piano_Concerto . 
11201	br-e22	5	19	229733	`` Uncle_Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden_Twenties '' . 
11202	br-e22	5	20	229772	We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano_sonatas , chamber_music , gavottes , and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities . 
11203	br-e22	5	21	229815	We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth Century Composers . 
11204	br-e22	6	22	229837	Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . 
11205	br-e22	7	23	229922	So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : 
11206	br-e22	7	24	229931	in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_grounds of `` Uncle_Sam '' ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought . 
11207	br-e22	8	25	229981	Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing . 
11208	br-e22	8	26	229992	In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native_land . 
11209	br-e22	8	27	230011	The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission . 
11210	br-e22	8	28	230047	After this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men ; a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation - hunger and exposure . 
11211	br-e22	9	29	230090	In this changed world , Prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose . 
11212	br-e22	9	30	230109	Here , this happy , roving son of good_fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world . 
11213	br-e22	9	31	230143	Here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism - producing music for the masses . 
11214	br-e22	10	32	230161	It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges . 
11215	br-e22	10	33	230175	One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous . 
11216	br-e22	11	34	230206	But no : Prokofieff grew . 
11217	br-e22	11	35	230212	He accepted the environment of his destiny - took_root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise . 
11218	br-e22	11	36	230232	By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : `` I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at_the_same_time I have by_no_means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody . 
11219	br-e22	11	37	230272	This is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose - the clarity must be new , not old '' . 
11220	br-e22	11	38	230296	How right he was ; how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism . 
11221	br-e22	11	39	230329	And with what resource did Prokofieff back_up his Credo of words - with torrents of powerful music . 
11222	br-e22	11	40	230347	Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little Classical_Symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent Fifth_Symphony ; or the Love_for_Three_Oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , The Stone_Flower . 
11223	br-e22	11	41	230402	This masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous . 
11224	br-e22	12	42	230424	Of_course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them . 
11225	br-e22	12	43	230440	The early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ; the later works were conceived to affirm a way_of_life for fellow citizens . 
11226	br-e22	12	44	230465	However , in all of Prokofieff 's music , young or mature , we find his profile - his `` signature '' - his craftsman 's attitude . 
11227	br-e22	12	45	230493	Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per_se . 
11228	br-e22	12	46	230505	In orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color . 
11229	br-e22	12	47	230524	His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable . 
11230	br-e22	12	48	230534	His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle . 
11231	br-e22	12	49	230559	His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick . 
11232	br-e22	13	50	230570	Also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured_bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required . 
11233	br-e22	13	51	230636	That Prokofieff 's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe . 
11234	br-e22	13	52	230670	Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability . 
11235	br-e22	14	53	230683	Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated . 
11236	br-e22	15	54	230725	At this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge_Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; yet was never caught_up in it - never a slave to its academic dialectics . 
11237	br-e22	15	55	230786	Certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World - not his experimentations . 
11238	br-e22	16	56	230809	So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them . 
11239	br-e22	16	57	230826	Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances . 
11240	br-e22	16	58	230847	His fellow countryman , Igor Stravinsky , certainly did not . 
11241	br-e22	16	59	230858	Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while Stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ? 
11242	br-e22	16	60	230885	I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff 's own words : 
11243	br-e22	16	61	230899	`` the clarity must be new , not old '' . 
11244	br-e22	16	62	230910	When Prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose '' , he shaped his talents to his purpose . 
11245	br-e22	17	63	230937	When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures . 
11246	br-e22	17	64	230977	Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people - by the compass of their national ideas . 
11247	br-e22	17	65	231000	But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting . 
11248	br-e22	17	66	231014	In all his miscalculations , Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers ' inspirations - representing many peoples , time_periods and styles - into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments . 
11249	br-e22	17	67	231064	Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations - his brilliant Petruchka , his savage Sacre_du_Printemps , his incisive Les_Noces - the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed . 
11250	br-e22	18	68	231112	But time is running_out , and many_of Stravinsky 's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra_firma . 
11251	br-e22	18	69	231132	His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a_house_divided_against_itself : Supra_Expressionism , Neo Paganism , Neo_Classicism , Neo_Romanticism , Neo_Jazz , Neo Ecclesiasticism , Neo Popularism , and most_recently , Post Serialism - all competing with each other within one composer ! 
11252	br-e22	18	70	231174	What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! 
11253	br-e22	18	71	231182	Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ; a maladroit reharmonization of our National_Anthem ( The Star-Spangled_Banner ) ; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; a circus polka for elephants ; his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs ! 
11254	br-e22	18	72	231242	Stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home . 
11255	br-e22	19	73	231271	How differently Prokofieff 's life unfolded . 
11256	br-e22	19	74	231278	Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction . 
11257	br-e22	19	75	231299	In the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose . 
11258	br-e22	20	76	231318	With a large and circumspect 20_th Century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children 's fairy_tales - Slavic dances and love songs - into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the World at_large . 
11259	br-e22	21	77	231371	Of_course , it must_not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ; time and economic security ; symphony_orchestras , opera and ballet_companies ; choruses , chamber_music ensembles ; soloists ; recordings ; broadcastings ; television ; large and eager audiences . 
11260	br-e22	21	78	231424	It must be conceded that his native_land provided Prokofieff with many_of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive : 
11261	br-e22	21	79	231443	economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology - a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose . 
11262	br-e22	22	80	231476	Thus in Prokofieff the Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century . 
11263	br-e22	22	81	231492	That his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it . 
11264	br-e22	22	82	231521	That he mastered every aspect of his medium according_to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture ; and perhaps of even greater significance - his music is strong 20_th Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution , based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music . 
11265	br-e22	23	83	231594	April 10 marked a memorable date in New_York 's musical history - indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United_States . 
11266	br-e22	23	84	231617	On that date the Musicians_Emergency_Fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock_market crash , observed its 30_th anniversary . 
11267	br-e23	1	1	231657	Roy_Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of John_Sell_Cotman . 
11268	br-e23	1	2	231688	And like this English master , Mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in_reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them . 
11269	br-e23	2	3	231733	As a boy Roy_Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods . 
11270	br-e23	2	4	231763	His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting_expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature . 
11271	br-e23	2	5	231793	Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on_the_wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . 
11272	br-e23	2	6	231840	It is this subject_matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors . 
11273	br-e23	3	7	231874	Mason had_to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting . 
11274	br-e23	3	8	231886	Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family_business which , though it was allied to art of a kind - the design and production of engraved seals - bore no relation to the painting of pictures . 
11275	br-e23	3	9	231931	But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial_art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia . 
11276	br-e23	3	10	231962	On the death of their father , they returned to their home in Batavia , New_York . 
11277	br-e23	3	11	231979	After more years of concentrated effort , Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family_business at the old stand . 
11278	br-e23	4	12	232001	During all this time Roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and_then , as the family_business permitted , for longer periods . 
11279	br-e23	4	13	232026	Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions . 
11280	br-e23	4	14	232058	But even on these , the palette often takes_over while the shotgun cools_off ! 
11281	br-e23	5	15	232072	Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey_Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had - and this was limited to a_few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together - Roy developed his art by himself . 
11282	br-e23	5	16	232119	In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and_then to paint . 
11283	br-e23	5	17	232143	He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium . 
11284	br-e23	5	18	232181	Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique . 
11285	br-e23	6	19	232201	It has been my privilege to paint with Roy_Mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia . 
11286	br-e23	6	20	232221	More_often_than_not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting . 
11287	br-e23	6	21	232256	What I have observed time_and_time_again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes_on recognizable form ; color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition ; and that over_all , amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark . 
11288	br-e23	6	22	232306	Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done . 
11289	br-e23	6	23	232321	Inspiring - yes ; instructive - maybe ; duplicable - no ! 
11290	br-e23	7	24	232333	But for the technical fact , we have the artist 's own testimony : 
11291	br-e23	8	25	232347	`` Of_late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors . 
11292	br-e23	8	26	232361	First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately * * f inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values - the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark - by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns . 
11293	br-e23	8	27	232417	If a human figure or wild_life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch . 
11294	br-e23	8	28	232443	For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose . 
11295	br-e23	9	29	232488	`` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him . 
11296	br-e23	9	30	232531	Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition . 
11297	br-e23	9	31	232569	If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result . 
11298	br-e23	9	32	232595	Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call ' clicking ' . 
11299	br-e23	10	33	232647	`` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do_well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . 
11300	br-e23	11	34	232698	`` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color . 
11301	br-e23	11	35	232720	Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . 
11302	br-e23	11	36	232764	When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if I have been working on a full sheet in the field . 
11303	br-e23	12	37	232794	`` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal . 
11304	br-e23	12	38	232819	When this linear draft is completed , I dust it down to a faint image . 
11305	br-e23	12	39	232835	From this point , I paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage . 
11306	br-e23	12	40	232865	However , first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described . 
11307	br-e23	12	41	232886	Then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details - all_in_all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness . 
11308	br-e23	12	42	232924	The longer I work , the more I am sure that for me , at_least , a workmanlike method is important . 
11309	br-e23	12	43	232946	Trial_and_error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting . 
11310	br-e23	13	44	232964	`` As for materials , I use the best available . 
11311	br-e23	13	45	232975	I work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain . 
11312	br-e23	13	46	233001	In my studio I work at a tilt-top_table , but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes . 
11313	br-e23	13	47	233027	I have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an English make , rough surface , in 400 - pound weight . 
11314	br-e23	13	48	233052	After selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins ' on its surface ) , I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water . 
11315	br-e23	13	49	233089	Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board . 
11316	br-e23	14	50	233107	`` In_addition_to the usual tools , I make constant use of cleansing tissue , not_only to wipe my brushes , but to mop_up certain areas , to soften edges , and to open_up lights in dark washes . 
11317	br-e23	14	51	233145	The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist . 
11318	br-e23	14	52	233172	I also use a small electric hand_blower to dry large washes in the studio . 
11319	br-e23	15	53	233187	`` My brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists , for I combine the sable and the bristle . 
11320	br-e23	15	54	233208	The red sables are 8 ; two riggers , 6 and 10 ; and a very large , flat wash brush . 
11321	br-e23	15	55	233230	The bristles are a Fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge . 
11322	br-e23	16	56	233248	`` My usual palette consists_of top-quality colors : 
11323	br-e23	16	57	233256	alizarin_crimson , orange , raw_sienna , raw_umber , burnt_sienna , sepia , cerulean_blue , cobalt_blue , French_ultramarine_blue , Winsor_green , Hooker's_green 2 , cadmium_yellow pale , yellow_ochre , Payne's_gray , charcoal_gray , Davy's_gray , and ivory_black '' . 
11324	br-e23	17	58	233294	In analyzing the watercolors of Roy_Mason , the first thing that comes_to_mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . 
11325	br-e23	17	59	233326	True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . 
11326	br-e23	17	60	233343	Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist 's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . 
11327	br-e23	18	61	233365	Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; a middle_distance often containing the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . 
11328	br-e23	18	62	233422	In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . 
11329	br-e23	19	63	233451	When painting , Mason 's physical eyes are half closed , while his mind's_eye is wide_open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . 
11330	br-e23	19	64	233482	He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia . 
11331	br-e23	19	65	233514	It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment . 
11332	br-e23	19	66	233534	His pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale ; they universalize in_terms_of weather , skies , earth , and people . 
11333	br-e23	19	67	233559	By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy_Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art . 
11334	br-e23	19	68	233580	Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all . 
11335	br-e23	20	69	233618	The artist was_born in Gilbert_Mills , New_York , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California , he lived in western New_York , in Batavia . 
11336	br-e23	20	70	233652	When I looked_up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15_th , I realized that Roy was_born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : 
11337	br-e23	20	71	233683	the water sign of Pisces ( February 18 - March 20 ) . 
11338	br-e23	20	72	233696	And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American_Artist again , in his natal month of March ! 
11339	br-e23	21	73	233727	Over the years , beginning in 1929 , Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ; two Ranger_Fund_purchase_awards ; the Joseph_Pennell_Memorial_Medal ; two American_Watercolor_Society_prizes ; the Blair_Purchase_Prize for watercolor , Art_Institute of Chicago ; and_others in Buffalo , New_York , Chautauqua , New_Haven , Rochester , Rockport , and most_recently , the $ 300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna_Beach_Art_Association , 
11340	br-e23	22	74	233793	He was elected to the National_Academy_of_Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger_Fund_Purchase_Prize at the Academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 . 
11341	br-e23	22	75	233828	Other memberships include the American_Watercolor_Society , Philadelphia_Water_Color_Club , Allied_Artists_of_America , Audubon_Artists , Baltimore_Watercolor_Society . 
11342	br-e25	1	1	233842	Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics . 
11343	br-e25	1	2	233875	We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry . 
11344	br-e25	1	3	233898	The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality . 
11345	br-e25	2	4	233924	When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering . 
11346	br-e25	2	5	233940	The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic_equipment has enormous possibilities . 
11347	br-e25	2	6	233969	The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by_far than any previous medical discovery . 
11348	br-e25	2	7	233986	We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research . 
11349	br-e25	3	8	234004	Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray_machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy_machine . 
11350	br-e25	3	9	234031	Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis . 
11351	br-e25	4	10	234051	Commonly used electronic_devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit TV and audio_systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices . 
11352	br-e25	5	11	234083	In this article we will concentrate_on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow 's commonplace equipment originates . 
11353	br-e25	5	12	234110	From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a_few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research . 
11354	br-e25	6	13	234155	Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible_light and must be stained for microscopic investigation . 
11355	br-e25	6	14	234175	This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or_else colors only the outside . 
11356	br-e25	6	15	234189	A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible_light with ultraviolet_radiation and combines a microscope with a color - TV_system to view the results . 
11357	br-e25	7	16	234227	Fig. 1 is a simplified block_diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical_Electronics_Center of Rockefeller_Institute . 
11358	br-e25	7	17	234245	By combining the talents of a medical_man , Dr._Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr._Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr._Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes . 
11359	br-e25	8	18	234284	Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet_radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in_front_of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources . 
11360	br-e25	8	19	234309	These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; the specimen is magnified by the microscope . 
11361	br-e25	8	20	234331	Instead of the observer 's eye the image_orthicon in the TV_camera does the `` looking '' . 
11362	br-e25	8	21	234348	The microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet_spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz . 
11363	br-e25	9	22	234371	The video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet_light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen . 
11364	br-e25	9	23	234417	( Note : 
11365	br-e25	9	24	234420	Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator like assembly rotated by a synchronous_motor . 
11366	br-e25	9	25	234445	This assembly also supplies a 20 - cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry . ) 
11367	br-e25	9	26	234461	This is the same system as was used in the field sequential color_TV system which preceded the present simultaneous system . 
11368	br-e25	9	27	234482	Three separate amplifiers then drive a 21 - inch tricolor tube . 
11369	br-e25	9	28	234494	The result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths . 
11370	br-e25	10	29	234515	Many_of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible_light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet_spectrum . 
11371	br-e25	10	30	234537	Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color . 
11372	br-e25	10	31	234565	Where the microscope under visible_light may show only vague shadows or nothing at_all , ultraviolet_illumination and subsequent translation into a color TV picture reveal a wealth of detail . 
11373	br-e25	11	32	234594	At the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it . 
11374	br-e25	12	33	234615	The medical title of `` Lobar_Ventilation_in_Man '' by Drs._C._J._Martin and A._C._Young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process . 
11375	br-e25	12	34	234651	At the University_of_Washington_Medical_School , the electronics group has developed the `` Respiratory_Gas_Analyzer '' shown in Fig. 3 . 
11376	br-e25	12	35	234669	This unit , affectionately dubbed `` The_Monster '' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient 's breathing . 
11377	br-e25	13	36	234697	In the lower center rack an 8 - channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon_dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with_respect_to each_other . 
11378	br-e25	13	37	234750	Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing_still , or in some other medically significant position . 
11379	br-e25	13	38	234772	From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail . 
11380	br-e25	14	39	234789	The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today 's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat . 
11381	br-e25	14	40	234833	For many_of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood_vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed . 
11382	br-e25	15	41	234853	A group of researchers at the University_of_Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques . 
11383	br-e25	15	42	234872	One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched . 
11384	br-e25	15	43	234909	A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed . 
11385	br-e25	16	44	234924	Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood_vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy . 
11386	br-e25	16	45	234957	The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes about 16 | msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue . 
11387	br-e25	16	46	234984	A sonar or radar type of pulse_generator and time-delay_measuring_system is required for body tissue evaluation . 
11388	br-e25	16	47	235000	In_addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique . 
11389	br-e25	16	48	235021	The Doppler_effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood_vessel . 
11390	br-e25	17	49	235043	A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself . 
11391	br-e25	17	50	235061	It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream . 
11392	br-e25	17	51	235082	The latter measures the heat carried_away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow . 
11393	br-e25	17	52	235102	It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart 's left_ventricle , to indicate the blood_pressure in the heart itself . 
11394	br-e25	17	53	235137	This pressure measurement may be made at_the_same_time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made . 
11395	br-e25	17	54	235152	A simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig. 2 . 
11396	br-e25	17	55	235167	Outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse_timing_circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue_computer which feeds a multichannel_recorder . 
11397	br-e25	17	56	235192	From this doctors can read heart_rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power . 
11398	br-e25	18	57	235210	Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio_transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers . 
11399	br-e25	18	58	235240	This original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm. in diameter . 
11400	br-e25	18	59	235258	Battery life limited the use of this `` pill '' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum . 
11401	br-e25	19	60	235276	A refinement of this technique has been described by Drs._Zworykin and Farrar and Mr._Berkely of the Medical_Electronics_Center of the Rockefeller_Institute . 
11402	br-e25	19	61	235297	In this novel arrangement the `` pill '' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in_which the capacitor is formed by a pressure sensing transducer . 
11403	br-e25	19	62	235325	As shown in Fig. 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400 - kc. bursts . 
11404	br-e25	19	63	235354	The energy received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes_place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' . 
11405	br-e25	19	64	235390	These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained . 
11406	br-e25	20	65	235425	One of the advantages of_this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions . 
11407	br-e25	20	66	235452	Applications to organs other_than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments . 
11408	br-e25	21	67	235465	One of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human_body . 
11409	br-e25	21	68	235486	Our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound_waves are sent_out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects . 
11410	br-e25	21	69	235509	Various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound_waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean_floors , and even communicate under water . 
11411	br-e25	21	70	235535	In medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar . 
11412	br-e25	22	71	235572	Because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood_vessels . 
11413	br-e25	22	72	235592	Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals . 
11414	br-e25	22	73	235605	Based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through '' human organs . 
11415	br-e25	22	74	235626	A good_example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by Dr._G._Baum who has explored the human eye . 
11416	br-e25	22	75	235649	He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due_to glaucoma . 
11417	br-e25	22	76	235664	The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig. 6 . 
11418	br-e25	22	77	235678	The transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown . 
11419	br-e25	22	78	235693	For display , Dr._Baum uses a portion of an * * f , an airborne radar indicator , and_then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record . 
11420	br-e25	23	79	235721	A typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in Fig. 5 . 
11421	br-e25	23	80	235746	The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter . 
11422	br-e25	23	81	235777	The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90 - degree arc in_front_of the eye to `` look_into '' all corners . 
11423	br-e25	23	82	235817	The total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90 - degree rotation period . 
11424	br-e25	24	83	235841	Drs._Howry and Holmes at the University_of_Colorado_Medical_School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results . 
11425	br-e25	24	84	235866	By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes_on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in Fig. 7 , as_well_as many other hitherto impossible insights . 
11426	br-e25	24	85	235907	As mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig. 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center . 
11427	br-e25	24	86	235934	Arteries and veins are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls . 
11428	br-e25	25	87	235951	A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in Fig. 8 with the various parts labeled . 
11429	br-e26	1	1	235970	Oersted 's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life . 
11430	br-e26	1	2	235996	He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south_central part of Denmark on August 14 , 1777 . 
11431	br-e26	1	3	236023	His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let_alone educate them in a town without even a school . 
11432	br-e26	1	4	236052	The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish . 
11433	br-e26	1	5	236097	Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum . 
11434	br-e26	1	6	236128	Oldenburg 's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn_to a wider circle of the town 's learned , such_as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching . 
11435	br-e26	1	7	236159	From the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university_student , some academic subjects . 
11436	br-e26	1	8	236179	The mayor of the town taught them English and French . 
11437	br-e26	1	9	236190	Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed_on to each other ; they read every book that they could borrow in the village . 
11438	br-e26	1	10	236214	At 12 , Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science . 
11439	br-e26	1	11	236240	His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life . 
11440	br-e26	2	12	236255	In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University_of_Copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session . 
11441	br-e26	2	13	236286	While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law . 
11442	br-e26	2	14	236306	The brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt . 
11443	br-e26	2	15	236337	They supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could . 
11444	br-e26	2	16	236354	So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society . 
11445	br-e26	2	17	236429	I lived in this onward driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error '' . 
11446	br-e26	2	18	236456	He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing_about science . 
11447	br-e26	2	19	236467	In_this third year at the university , Hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` Limits_of_Poetry_and_Prose '' . 
11448	br-e26	2	20	236499	He completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor_of_Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine . 
11449	br-e26	2	21	236535	He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices . 
11450	br-e26	3	22	236550	Han 's student days were at_a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent . 
11451	br-e26	4	23	236594	The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in_charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university . 
11452	br-e26	4	24	236618	He was stirred by the announcement of Volta 's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic_pile to experiments with acids and alkalis . 
11453	br-e26	4	25	236644	The following year he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany , France , and the_Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck . 
11454	br-e26	4	26	236675	He also met Count_Rumford ( born Benjamin_Thompson in Woburn,_Mass . ) who was then serving the Elector_of_Bavaria , and the physicist Ritter ; these were Oersted 's main contacts in science . 
11455	br-e26	5	27	236707	From Go ^ ttingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` The first question asked everywhere is about galvanism . 
11456	br-e26	5	28	236734	As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes I have invented , I have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in Copenhagen I used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me '' . 
11457	br-e26	5	29	236778	Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left . 
11458	br-e26	5	30	236798	With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host 's fertile but disorganized mind . 
11459	br-e26	5	31	236820	Oersted remodeled Ritter 's notes into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut_de_France for its annual prize of 3000 francs . 
11460	br-e26	5	32	236844	The sound discoveries of_this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him . 
11461	br-e26	5	33	236866	In May , 1803 , Ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy . 
11462	br-e26	5	34	236890	He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries . 
11463	br-e26	5	35	236919	Thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` Leiden '' jar by Kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of Volta , and 1801 the voltaic_pile . 
11464	br-e26	5	36	236955	Ritter proceeded , `` You now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon . 
11465	br-e26	5	37	236982	This we might well witness '' . 
11466	br-e26	5	38	236989	Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not_only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it . 
11467	br-e26	6	39	237009	In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university 's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist . 
11468	br-e26	6	40	237039	However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals . 
11469	br-e26	6	41	237059	In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen_University , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 . 
11470	br-e26	7	42	237086	During Oersted 's attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences . 
11471	br-e26	7	43	237107	He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof._J._G._L._Manthey ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in_addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion_Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him . 
11472	br-e26	7	44	237151	Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted 's disposal during and after his graduation . 
11473	br-e26	7	45	237173	In 1800 , Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion_Pharmacy . 
11474	br-e26	7	46	237188	In February 1801 , Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic_battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead . 
11475	br-e26	7	47	237229	In the following year , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic_battery more_than did salts . 
11476	br-e26	7	48	237255	Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded_down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' . 
11477	br-e26	8	49	237298	He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood . 
11478	br-e26	8	50	237320	The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level . 
11479	br-e26	8	51	237339	His broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him . 
11480	br-e26	8	52	237356	His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong . 
11481	br-e26	9	53	237368	The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek_out the philosophers as he had on his first journey . 
11482	br-e26	9	54	237401	In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws_of_nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris , 1813 ) under the title Recherches_sur_l_'_identite_des_forces_chimiques_et_electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists . 
11483	br-e26	9	55	237445	His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated . 
11484	br-e26	9	56	237461	Chapter 8 , is entitled `` On_Magnetism '' and in it are included such remarks as , `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic_forces with the electrical forces . 
11485	br-e26	9	57	237493	The great resemblance between electrical and magnetic_attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring_about this comparison . 
11486	br-e26	9	58	237514	It is true , that nothing has been found comparable_with electricity by communication ; but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending_on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference . 
11487	br-e26	9	59	237552	The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form . 
11488	br-e26	9	60	237568	There , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism . 
11489	br-e26	9	61	237584	But in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to_it . 
11490	br-e26	9	62	237627	One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do . 
11491	br-e26	9	63	237662	It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb . 
11492	br-e26	9	64	237682	By that , one feels that magnetic_forces are as general as electrical forces . 
11493	br-e26	9	65	237696	An attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as_such '' . 
11494	br-e26	9	66	237721	His plan and intent were clearly charted . 
11495	br-e26	10	67	237729	Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions . 
11496	br-e26	10	68	237744	In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as_opposed_to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in_fact an act of religious worship . 
11497	br-e26	10	69	237773	He continued as a popular lecturer . 
11498	br-e26	10	70	237780	He devised a detonating_fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric_current . 
11499	br-e26	11	71	237797	In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm , one of the Danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition . 
11500	br-e26	11	72	237827	It was with the assistance of one of the members of_this expedition , Lauritz_Esmarch , that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric_discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric_current was made to flow . 
11501	br-e26	11	73	237864	Together they also developed a new form of voltaic_cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents . 
11502	br-e26	11	74	237890	Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted 's first demonstration of his discovery . 
11503	br-e26	12	75	237904	The association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic_forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades . 
11504	br-e26	12	76	237926	Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles . 
11505	br-e26	12	77	237946	In the late 1700 's Beccaria and van_Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it . 
11506	br-e26	12	78	237969	Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden_jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch spring steel making its ends magnetic . 
11507	br-e26	12	79	238004	The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise . 
11508	br-e26	12	80	238018	The experiments of Romagnosi and_others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause and effect relationship between these two primary forces . 
11509	br-e26	12	81	238043	Oersted 's own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting_wire across the compass needle instead_of parallel with_it . 
11510	br-e26	13	82	238071	The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of Oersted 's discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 . 
11511	br-e26	13	83	238129	At this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting_wire over and parallel to a magnetic_needle .

11601	br-e27	45	90	239741	Incorporated in commercially prepared feed at proper levels . 
11602	br-e27	46	91	239750	Prevents and treats acetonemia ( ketosis ) in dairy_cows . 
11603	br-e27	47	92	239760	For prevention of ketosis , feed 1_4 pound per head daily for 6 weeks commencing at calving time . 
11604	br-e27	47	93	239779	For treatment of ketosis , feed 1_2 pound daily until symptoms disappear . 
11605	br-e27	47	94	239792	Then , feed preventive dose until 6 weeks after calving .

11607	br-e27	49	96	239833	Not less than .75 milligram but not more than 1.25 milligrams of additive per pound of body_weight . 
11608	br-e27	50	97	239851	Additive should not be fed 72 hours before animals are slaughtered . 
11609	br-e27	50	98	239863	There are three principal feed_bunk types for dairy and beef_cattle : ( 1 ) Fence-line bunks - cattle eat from one side while feed is put_in from the opposite side of the fence by self unloading wagons ; ( 2 ) Mechanized bunks - they sit within the feed_lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface ; ( 3 ) Special bunks - as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides . 
11610	br-e27	50	99	239942	Feed is put_in with an elevator . 
11611	br-e27	51	100	239949	Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed_bunk . 
11612	br-e27	51	101	239964	The selection of materials depends_on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available locally , and your own preference . 
11613	br-e27	51	102	239987	No one material is best for all situations . 
11614	br-e27	51	103	239996	Selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem . 
11615	br-e27	52	104	240007	Animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk . 
11616	br-e27	52	105	240028	These bunks also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence . 
11617	br-e27	52	106	240049	Because of their location , on the edge of the feed_lot , fence-line bunks are not in_the_way_of mechanical manure removal . 
11618	br-e27	52	107	240070	Filling these bunks by the same self unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations . 
11619	br-e27	53	108	240094	All-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year . 
11620	br-e27	53	109	240112	This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall . 
11621	br-e28	1	1	240123	Marketing in the new decade will be no picnic - for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20 - 25 yr. . 
11622	br-e28	2	2	240156	Why ? 
11623	br-e28	2	3	240158	Companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies - in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged R_+_D facilities , faster new product development . 
11624	br-e28	2	4	240188	Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge . 
11625	br-e28	3	5	240212	Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yr. ? 
11626	br-e28	3	6	240233	Based on our experience with clients , we see 14 major problems which fall_into three broad groups - the market_place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management . 
11627	br-e28	4	7	240262	There has been an intensification of price consciousness in recent years ; there is every indication it will continue . 
11628	br-e28	4	8	240282	Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers . 
11629	br-e28	4	9	240301	Despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before - traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer . 
11630	br-e28	5	10	240329	Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : 
11631	br-e28	6	11	240347	Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? 
11632	br-e28	6	12	240364	Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? 
11633	br-e28	6	13	240386	Have you actually checked_out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ? 
11634	br-e28	7	14	240407	Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions . 
11635	br-e28	7	15	240428	This problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses . 
11636	br-e28	7	16	240443	Have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? 
11637	br-e28	8	17	240460	Need for service is here to stay - and the problem is going_to be tougher to solve in the sixties . 
11638	br-e28	8	18	240481	There are two reasons for this . 
11639	br-e28	8	19	240488	First , most products tend to become more complex . 
11640	br-e28	8	20	240498	Second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around . 
11641	br-e28	9	21	240515	Providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product . 
11642	br-e28	9	22	240537	Too often it is thought_of at the last moment of new product introduction . 
11643	br-e28	10	23	240551	Good service starts with product design and planning : 
11644	br-e28	10	24	240560	Many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one . 
11645	br-e28	10	25	240577	Proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not_only in the techniques but also in good customer relations . 
11646	br-e28	11	26	240602	Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? 
11647	br-e28	12	27	240615	In spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions . 
11648	br-e28	12	28	240629	To the manufacturer of the more convenient type product - the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put_off entirely - the implications are important . 
11649	br-e28	12	29	240658	Your competition is now proportionately greater - you are competing not_only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products . 
11650	br-e28	13	30	240689	Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer 's dollar being spent on their particular products . 
11651	br-e28	13	31	240714	Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ? 
11652	br-e28	14	32	240730	The trends have been in_evidence for many years - population_shifts to the Southwest and Far_West , and from city to suburbs . 
11653	br-e28	14	33	240752	These shifts will continue in the next 10 yr. . 
11654	br-e28	14	34	240762	Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in_terms_of sales_force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ? 
11655	br-e28	15	35	240785	We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry - at both the manufacturing and retail ends . 
11656	br-e28	15	36	240808	Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts . 
11657	br-e28	16	37	240828	The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention - practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted . 
11658	br-e28	16	38	240861	Have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? 
11659	br-e28	17	39	240883	In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under_way during the first decade . 
11660	br-e28	17	40	240909	As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share_in the manufacturer 's as_well as the distributor 's profits - which is , in_effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do . 
11661	br-e28	18	41	240955	Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded . 
11662	br-e28	18	42	240980	Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain_stores have insisted on high_quality - and the customer seems to have caught_on . 
11663	br-e28	19	43	241005	If you are up_against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? 
11664	br-e28	19	44	241027	If private brand competition has n't been felt in your product field as_yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? 
11665	br-e28	20	45	241057	Display merchandising , backed by pre selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties . 
11666	br-e28	20	46	241078	It has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program . 
11667	br-e28	21	47	241090	How can you cash_in_on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ? 
11668	br-e28	21	48	241112	If you have a higher quality product , how can you make it stand_out - justify its premium price - without the spoken word ? 
11669	br-e28	21	49	241137	Salesmanship is still necessary , but it 's a different brand of salesmanship . 
11670	br-e28	22	50	241151	Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ? 
11671	br-e28	22	51	241164	Have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales_force in_relation_to requirements for effective marketing ? 
11672	br-e28	22	52	241181	Are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ? 
11673	br-e28	23	53	241193	Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes . 
11674	br-e28	23	54	241219	No manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing_out the costs involved . 
11675	br-e28	24	55	241231	The use of bulk handling is continuously growing . 
11676	br-e28	24	56	241240	Computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels . 
11677	br-e28	24	57	241253	`` Selective selling '' - concentrating sales on the larger accounts - has been used effectively by some manufacturers . 
11678	br-e28	25	58	241273	There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain . 
11679	br-e28	25	59	241293	Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully - and with some imagination ? 
11680	br-e28	25	60	241312	In your sales_force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make_out better with a larger number of lower paid salesmen ? 
11681	br-e28	26	61	241344	Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in_return_for some benefit they can share ? 
11682	br-e28	26	62	241362	In one company covering the country with a high quality sales_force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos. . 
11683	br-e28	26	63	241388	As a result , distribution_costs were cut , customer relations improved . 
11684	br-e28	27	64	241400	Distribution_costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job . 
11685	br-e28	28	65	241437	From the manufacturer 's point_of_view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties . 
11686	br-e28	28	66	241462	It is accentuated by the need for pre selling goods , and private label competition . 
11687	br-e28	29	67	241478	How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? 
11688	br-e28	29	68	241493	Are you following competition willy-nilly - trying to match dollar for dollar - or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers ? 
11689	br-e28	29	69	241519	Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program - from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? 
11690	br-e28	30	70	241549	Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon . 
11691	br-e28	30	71	241561	Will you be out in the market_place with some of these sales building new products ? 
11692	br-e28	31	72	241577	If competition beats you to_it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in_store . 
11693	br-e28	31	73	241594	On_the_other_hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive . 
11694	br-e28	31	74	241613	As markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger . 
11695	br-e28	32	75	241631	Is your R_+_D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? 
11696	br-e28	32	76	241648	Are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R_+_D people ? 
11697	br-e28	32	77	241667	Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it 's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash_register . 
11698	br-e28	33	78	241685	Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution_costs ; and translate the whole into profit_and_loss and balance_sheet figures which management can act_on with some assurance ? 
11699	br-e28	33	79	241732	We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans - and management could n't make_up_its_mind . 
11700	br-e28	34	80	241758	There is a shortage of salesmen today . 
11701	br-e28	34	81	241766	In the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still . 
11702	br-e28	35	82	241792	While many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training . 
11703	br-e28	35	83	241815	Nor has the training been enough in_relation_to the need . 
11704	br-e28	35	84	241825	Most marketing people agree it is going_to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements . 
11705	br-e28	36	85	241840	Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? 
11706	br-e28	36	86	241857	Has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yr. ? 
11707	br-e28	37	87	241883	With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today - and it will be tougher in_the future . 
11708	br-e28	37	88	241921	Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due_to the demanding combination of qualifications called_for by this type of management work . 
11709	br-e28	37	89	241948	The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties . 
11710	br-e28	38	90	241971	Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management_personnel for the longer term ? 
11711	br-e28	38	91	241990	Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? 
11712	br-e28	39	92	242006	Every single problem touched_on thus_far is related to good marketing planning . 
11713	br-e28	39	93	242018	`` Hip-pocket '' tactics are going_to be harder to apply . 
11714	br-e28	39	94	242029	Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis . 
11715	br-e28	39	95	242042	They have to be . 
11716	br-e28	39	96	242047	With greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can n't switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible - or at_least not as economically . 
11717	br-e28	40	97	242085	Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? 
11718	br-e28	40	98	242096	We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning . 
11719	br-e28	41	99	242114	Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? 
11720	br-e28	41	100	242138	Do you have a long-term ( 5 - or 10 - yr . ) marketing program ? 
11721	br-e28	42	101	242155	The key to effective marketing is wrapped_up in defining your company 's marketing problems realistically . 
11722	br-e28	42	102	242171	Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management . 
11723	br-e28	43	103	242197	If companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade . 
11724	br-e30	1	1	242235	How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program ? 
11725	br-e30	1	2	242252	Have you permitted it to become a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee morale and , consequently , increased productivity ?

11729	br-e30	3	6	242323	Is it reaching these goals ? 
11730	br-e30	3	7	242329	Is it larger or fancier than you really need ? 
11731	br-e30	3	8	242339	Are you using the most economical printing methods , paper , etc. . 
11732	br-e30	3	9	242352	Are there other , cheaper communications techniques that could be substituted ? 
11733	br-e30	4	10	242364	Has your attitude toward employee benefits encouraged an excess of free `` government '' work in your plant ? 
11734	br-e30	5	11	242383	Is your purchasing_agent offering too_much free buying service for employees ?

11736	br-e30	7	13	242425	When negotiating with your union , do you make sure employees have a choice between new benefits and their cents per hour cost in wages .

11738	br-e30	9	15	242479	Do your employees understand all the benefits to which your insurance entitles them ? 
11739	br-e30	9	16	242493	Are they encouraged to take full legal advantage of these benefits ? 
11740	br-e30	9	17	242505	Have you publicized the cents per hour value of the company 's share of insurance_premiums ?

11744	br-e30	13	21	242569	Do you protect your holiday privileges with an attendance requirement both before and after the holiday ?

11788	br-e30	51	65	243270	If you have an annual or regular physical examination program , is it worth what it is costing you ? 
11789	br-e30	52	66	243290	Consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting_up or revamping your employee benefit program . 
11790	br-e30	52	67	243311	Too many plant officials are all_too eager to buy a package program from an insurance_company simply because it works for another plant . 
11791	br-e30	53	68	243334	But even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product , there are other facts to consider . 
11792	br-e30	53	69	243359	How old is your working force ? 
11793	br-e30	53	70	243366	What 's your profit_margin ? 
11794	br-e30	53	71	243371	In what section of the country are you located ? 
11795	br-e30	53	72	243381	Are you in a rural or urban_area ? 
11796	br-e30	53	73	243389	These factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program . 
11797	br-e30	54	74	243404	Above_all , do n't set_up extravagant fringe_benefits just to buy employee good_will . 
11798	br-e30	54	75	243417	Unions stress fringe_benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time . 
11799	br-e30	55	76	243431	Aim to balance your employee benefit package . 
11800	br-e30	55	77	243439	Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe - say a liberal retirement plan - and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere . 
11801	br-e30	55	78	243461	They 're asking_for union trouble . 
11802	br-e30	56	79	243467	If you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they 're entitled to . 
11803	br-e30	56	80	243487	Encourage them to exercise their benefits . 
11804	br-e30	56	81	243494	This can be done by stories in your house_organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers ' homes as_well_as by_word_of_mouth through your chain of command . 
11805	br-e30	57	82	243522	Some companies find a little imagination helpful . 
11806	br-e30	57	83	243530	Hallmark_Cards_,_Inc. , Kansas_City , Mo. , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` Benefit_Bafflers '' , which it distributes to employees . 
11807	br-e30	57	84	243552	M_+_R_Dietetic_Laboratories_,_Inc. , Columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook - each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe . 
11808	br-e30	57	85	243577	U._S._Rubber_Company , New_York , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits . 
11809	br-e30	57	86	243591	The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for_example , costs $ 227.72 . 
11810	br-e30	58	87	243606	Have the insurance_company or your own accounting department break_down the cost of your insurance package periodically . 
11811	br-e30	58	88	243623	You may find certain coverage costing much more_than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions . 
11812	br-e30	59	89	243642	Check to see if some of your benefits - such_as on-the-job disability pay - can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you . 
11813	br-e30	60	90	243674	Use deductable insurance wherever feasible . 
11814	br-e30	60	91	243680	It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates . 
11815	br-e30	60	92	243696	Also , beware of open_end policies , especially in the medical field . 
11816	br-e30	60	93	243709	This will mean that every time there 's an increase in hospital rates your cost will go_up in like manner . 
11817	br-e30	60	94	243730	Put a dollar and cents limit on benefits . 
11818	br-e30	61	95	243739	Do n't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death . 
11819	br-e30	61	96	243752	Generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement . 
11820	br-e30	62	97	243771	In granting bereavement leaves , specify the maximum time_off and list what the worker 's relation to the deceased must be to qualify . 
11821	br-e30	62	98	243795	Thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin 's funeral . 
11822	br-e30	62	99	243812	Also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you 'll probably never use it . 
11823	br-e30	63	100	243833	Coffee_breaks can be a real headache if not regulated . 
11824	br-e30	63	101	243843	Vending_machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time . 
11825	br-e30	63	102	243862	If coffee is sold at the cafeteria , let a_few workers in each department get it for the whole group . 
11826	br-e30	63	103	243883	Consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas . 
11827	br-e30	63	104	243892	Make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee . 
11828	br-e30	63	105	243914	Otherwise , you may be saddled with a good size milk bill by milk drinkers . 
11829	br-e30	64	106	243930	Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such_as tool and die makers can be kept on_the_job for the convenience of the company . 
11830	br-e30	64	107	243954	And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age . 
11831	br-e30	64	108	243970	Make sure you have minimum age and time on_the_job requirements tied into your pension plan . 
11832	br-e30	64	109	243986	Younger men usually do n't think_of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they 're liable to change jobs several times before settling_down . 
11833	br-e30	65	110	244012	Choose carefully between contributory or non contributory pension plans . 
11834	br-e30	65	111	244022	There are two sides of a coin for this decision . 
11835	br-e30	65	112	244033	Workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to . 
11836	br-e30	65	113	244044	And they can at_least collect the money they put_in , plus interest , when they leave the company . 
11837	br-e30	65	114	244063	A non contributory plan usually won n't pay_off for the worker until he retires . 
11838	br-e30	65	115	244078	Thus , there is an added incentive to stay on_the_job . 
11839	br-e30	66	116	244089	Make sure you do n't pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working . 
11840	br-e30	66	117	244108	These include : 
11841	br-e30	66	118	244111	leaves_of_absences , illnesses , and layoffs . 
11842	br-e30	67	119	244118	Consider adopting a system of holidays in which time_off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant . 
11843	br-e30	67	120	244142	It 's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods . 
11844	br-e30	67	121	244161	For_example , the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington 's birthday . 
11845	br-e30	67	122	244175	This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups . 
11846	br-e30	68	123	244186	Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay . 
11847	br-e30	68	124	244206	This cuts the absentee_rate . 
11848	br-e30	69	125	244211	Consider using vending_machines rather than subsidized cafeterias . 
11849	br-e30	69	126	244219	Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you . 
11850	br-e30	69	127	244235	If a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price . 
11851	br-e30	69	128	244251	If the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won n't blame the concessionaire . 
11852	br-e30	69	129	244266	You 'll take the rap . 
11853	br-e30	70	130	244272	Check your cafeteria location to make sure it 's convenient for most employees . 
11854	br-e30	70	131	244286	You may save valuable production minutes with a change . 
11855	br-e30	71	132	244296	Spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two_weeks . 
11856	br-e30	71	133	244315	This will cut the expense of vacation replacements . 
11857	br-e30	71	134	244324	And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates . 
11858	br-e30	72	135	244343	Also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation . 
11859	br-e30	72	136	244364	You might try providing standard vacation time_off but make the vacation pay depend_on the number of hours worked in the previous year . 
11860	br-e31	1	1	244387	The long and ever increasing column of sportsmen is now moving_into a new era . 
11861	br-e31	1	2	244402	Modern_times have changed the world beyond recognition . 
11862	br-e31	1	3	244410	The early years of the twentieth century seem very far_away . 
11863	br-e31	1	4	244421	But with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain - a_few things remain constant , including the devotion of Americans to the great field_sports , hunting and fishing . 
11864	br-e31	2	5	244452	As the generations move_on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports . 
11865	br-e31	2	6	244468	Sporting firearms change , markedly for the better . 
11866	br-e31	2	7	244477	Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered_wagon , the demand of today 's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment . 
11867	br-e31	3	8	244503	The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle_loader and slow firing single shot arms with modern fast firing autoloaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide_action firearms . 
11868	br-e31	3	9	244541	And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today 's hunting and target shooting . 
11869	br-e31	4	10	244562	And due_to modern resource use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever expanding encroachment on land and water . 
11870	br-e31	4	11	244590	Present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural_resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped . 
11871	br-e31	4	12	244614	Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more_than 40 states , on shooting_preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game management ) for five and six months each_year . 
11872	br-e31	5	13	244646	Close to two million game_birds were harvested on 1500 commercial and private shooting_preserves , and on State_Game_Commission controlled upland game areas during the 1960 - 61 season . 
11873	br-e31	5	14	244674	The shooting development program of the Sporting_Arms_and_Ammunition_Manufacturers_'_Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers . 
11874	br-e31	6	15	244700	The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting_preserves . 
11875	br-e31	6	16	244720	This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the New_York staff of the Sportsmen's_Service_Bureau , and the SAAMI shooting_preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 . 
11876	br-e31	7	17	244756	Following the kick-off of SAAMI 's shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took_place in Washington , D._C. . 
11877	br-e31	7	18	244778	The group known_as the American_Association_for_Health_,_Physical_Education_,_and_Recreation ( a division of the National_Education_Association ) initiated a conference which brought_together representatives of the National_Rifle_Association , SAAMI and the American_Fishing_Tackle_Manufacturers . 
11878	br-e31	7	19	244805	This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known_as the Outdoor_Education_Project . 
11879	br-e31	8	20	244824	The Outdoor_Education_Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . 
11880	br-e31	8	21	244861	The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . 
11881	br-e31	8	22	244882	But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact_sports and physical_education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . 
11882	br-e31	9	23	244913	Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr._Julian_Smith , today thousands of secondary_schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation programs . 
11883	br-e31	9	24	244947	SAAMI 's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . 
11884	br-e31	9	25	244964	Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . 
11885	br-e31	9	26	245003	Considering that the current school age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach . 
11886	br-e31	10	27	245030	In 1959 SAAMI 's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports . 
11887	br-e31	10	28	245063	This program is now nationally known_as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' . 
11888	br-e31	11	29	245075	Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied_Merchandising_Corporation . 
11889	br-e31	11	30	245088	The first program was sponsored by Abraham_+_Strauss , Hempstead , New_York , under the direction of Special Events director Jennings_Dennis . 
11890	br-e31	11	31	245109	Other pilot_programs were conducted by A_+_S , Babylon , New_York ; J._L._Hudson , Detroit ; Joseph_Horne , Pittsburgh . 
11891	br-e31	12	32	245128	Other THC activities followed , conducted by shopping_centers , department_stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio - TV stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related_to hunting and wise use of our natural_resources . 
11892	br-e31	12	33	245185	SAAMI 's field men have served as consultants and / or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40000 enthusiastic young Americans . 
11893	br-e31	13	34	245213	Through the efforts of SAAMI 's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a_few . 
11894	br-e31	14	35	245262	The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . 
11895	br-e31	14	36	245305	While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many_of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it . 
11896	br-e31	14	37	245331	Help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level . 
11897	br-e31	15	38	245342	The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association . 
11898	br-e31	15	39	245359	Since SAAMI 's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone_into the development of more places to_shoot for more youths and adults . 
11899	br-e31	15	40	245400	We trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment . 
11900	br-e31	16	41	245420	Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ? 
11901	br-e31	16	42	245430	Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls , who will grow_up to enjoy a traditional American way_of_life - ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? 
11902	br-e31	17	43	245469	Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? 
11903	br-e31	18	44	245482	Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting_preserves ? 
11904	br-e31	18	45	245511	Ask Sammy_Shooter . 
11905	br-e31	18	46	245514	We were camping a_few weeks ago on Cape_Hatteras_Campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on North_Carolina 's famed Outer_Banks . 
11906	br-e31	18	47	245537	This beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use . 
11907	br-e31	19	48	245559	With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now . 
11908	br-e31	19	49	245581	There were umbrella_tents , wall_tents , cottage_tents , station_wagon tents , pup_tents , Pop_tents , Baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper_trailers , travel_trailers , and even a_few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps . 
11909	br-e31	20	50	245621	Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing_tackle , windbreaks and sunshades . 
11910	br-e31	20	51	245646	We saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70 mile long National_Seashore_Recreation_Area . 
11911	br-e31	20	52	245662	Dealers would do_well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers . 
11912	br-e31	20	53	245682	Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry . 
11913	br-e31	21	54	245698	Camping is big and getting bigger . 
11914	br-e31	21	55	245705	No one knows where it will stop . 
11915	br-e31	21	56	245713	Almost every official who reflects on_it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets . 
11916	br-e31	21	57	245738	You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping . 
11917	br-e31	21	58	245749	The number depends_on who is talking at the moment . 
11918	br-e31	21	59	245759	The figures range as high as 15 million families . 
11919	br-e31	21	60	245769	I 've heard 10 million mentioned often , but I 'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping . 
11920	br-e31	21	61	245798	Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more . 
11921	br-e31	21	62	245809	Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable . 
11922	br-e31	22	63	245831	Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with . 
11923	br-e31	22	64	245847	They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned_away , especially on holiday weekends . 
11924	br-e31	22	65	245869	The National_Parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure . 
11925	br-e31	22	66	245883	The National_Park_Service hopes by 1966 to have 30000 campsites available for 100000 campers a day - almost twice what there are at_present . 
11926	br-e31	22	67	245906	The U._S._Forest_Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily . 
11927	br-e31	23	68	245927	But the campers still come . 
11928	br-e31	23	69	245933	They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding . 
11929	br-e31	23	70	245945	They bring their fishing_rods and binoculars and bathing_suits . 
11930	br-e31	23	71	245954	They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance . 
11931	br-e31	24	72	245987	There are a half_dozen reasons helping to account_for the migration to the campgrounds . 
11932	br-e31	24	73	246001	Among them , according to the U._S. Department_of_Commerce , are : ( 1 ) shorter work_weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid_vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education . 
11933	br-e31	24	74	246049	The more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn . 
11934	br-e31	24	75	246064	Camping is family fun , and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before . 
11935	br-e31	25	76	246086	But make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn_to camping is one of economy . 
11936	br-e31	25	77	246104	Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford . 
11937	br-e31	26	78	246116	The American_Automobile_Association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes_up with an average daily expenditure figure of $ 29 . 
11938	br-e31	26	79	246141	The AAA then splits it down this way : $ 10.50 for meals , $ 9.50 for lodging , $ 7 for gas and oil , and $ 2 for tips and miscellaneous . 
11939	br-e31	27	80	246175	What does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? 
11940	br-e31	27	81	246187	The $ 9.50 for lodging they save . 
11941	br-e31	27	82	246195	Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $ 10.50 food bill along with most_of the tip money . 
11942	br-e31	27	83	246223	The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can n't either eliminate or pare_down drastically by camping along the way . 
11943	br-e31	28	84	246246	Where Americans used_to think_of a single vacation each summer , they now think_about how many vacations they can have . 
11944	br-e31	28	85	246266	Long weekends enable many to get_away from home for three or four days several times a year . 
11945	br-e31	28	86	246284	And even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces . 
11946	br-e31	29	87	246327	It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they 're buying the comforts of home . 
11947	br-e31	29	88	246350	They 're not . 
11948	br-e31	29	89	246354	Home is the place to find the comforts of home . 
11949	br-e31	29	90	246365	They 're buying fun and adventure and family experiences . 
11950	br-e31	29	91	246375	But it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become . 
11951	br-e31	29	92	246393	This is no_longer a way_of_life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy . 
11952	br-e31	29	93	246407	Today 's campers want comforts , and they have them . 
11953	br-e31	29	94	246418	And this helps explain why so many people are now going camping . 
11954	br-e31	29	95	246431	It 's fun , and it 's easy - so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get_out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families . 
11955	br-e31	30	96	246467	Camp meals are no great problem . 
11956	br-e31	30	97	246474	Neither are beds , thanks to air_mattresses and sleeping_bags . 
11957	br-e31	30	98	246484	Neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper . 
11958	br-e31	31	99	246503	But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs . 
11959	br-f08	1	1	246523	In tradition and in poetry , the marriage_bed is a place of unity and harmony . 
11960	br-f08	1	2	246539	The partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes_away an equal share of pleasure and joy . 
11961	br-f08	2	3	246559	At its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares . 
11962	br-f08	2	4	246575	Everything else is closed away . 
11963	br-f08	3	5	246581	This is the ideal . 
11964	br-f08	3	6	246586	But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved . 
11965	br-f08	3	7	246601	Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual_relationship . 
11966	br-f08	3	8	246611	In the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive . 
11967	br-f08	3	9	246629	But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed . 
11968	br-f08	4	10	246641	In a growing number of American homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual_relationships . 
11969	br-f08	4	11	246663	It is she who decides the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act . 
11970	br-f08	4	12	246685	It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics - not the husband . 
11971	br-f08	4	13	246707	The whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs . 
11972	br-f08	5	14	246721	Beyond a certain point , of_course , no woman can be dominant - nature has seen to that . 
11973	br-f08	5	15	246740	But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed . 
11974	br-f08	6	16	246758	Of_course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy . 
11975	br-f08	6	17	246775	Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly . 
11976	br-f08	6	18	246791	The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother 's or grandmother 's standards . 
11977	br-f08	7	19	246811	To many experts , this trend was inevitable . 
11978	br-f08	7	20	246820	They consider it simply a sign of our times . 
11979	br-f08	7	21	246830	Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority . 
11980	br-f08	7	22	246847	It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role . 
11981	br-f08	8	23	246860	`` The sexual_relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declares Dr._Mary_Steichen_Calderone , medical director of the Planned_Parenthood_Federation_of_America and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions . 
11982	br-f08	8	24	246891	`` It reflects what is going_on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself . 
11983	br-f08	8	25	246908	A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual_relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too '' . 
11984	br-f08	9	26	246934	Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous . 
11985	br-f08	9	27	246960	It can , in_fact , wreck a marriage . 
11986	br-f08	10	28	246969	When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife 's desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her . 
11987	br-f08	10	29	246996	And she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy . 
11988	br-f08	11	30	247009	On_the_other_hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity . 
11989	br-f08	11	31	247028	He is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often - since private affairs rarely remain private - to the outside world as_well . 
11990	br-f08	12	32	247054	`` A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband 's maleness '' , declares Dr._Calderone . 
11991	br-f08	12	33	247080	This opinion is supported by one of the nation 's leading psychiatrists , Dr._Maurice_E._Linden , director of the Mental_Health_Division of the Philadelphia_Department_of_Public_Health . 
11992	br-f08	13	34	247103	`` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower '' , Dr._Linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' . 
11993	br-f08	14	35	247146	In one extreme case , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker 's wife refused to have sexual_relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded . 
11994	br-f08	14	36	247178	To win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer . 
11995	br-f08	14	37	247200	Caught at_last , he was sentenced to prison . 
11996	br-f08	14	38	247209	While he was in custody his wife divorced him . 
11997	br-f08	15	39	247219	More typical is the case of a suburban Long_Island housewife described by a marriage counselor . 
11998	br-f08	15	40	247235	This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations . 
11999	br-f08	15	41	247249	To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores . 
12000	br-f08	15	42	247262	Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing - and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them . 
12001	br-f08	16	43	247294	One wife , described by a New_York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday night neighborhood card parties . 
12002	br-f08	16	44	247334	Another put sex on a dollars and cents basis . 
12003	br-f08	16	45	247344	After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband 's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor . 
12004	br-f08	17	46	247364	Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed . 
12005	br-f08	18	47	247377	The wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart_as_a_whip - often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage . 
12006	br-f08	18	48	247401	She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband . 
12007	br-f08	19	49	247419	The husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job - often an organization man whose motto for getting_ahead is : `` Do n't rock_the_boat '' . 
12008	br-f08	20	50	247448	Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage . 
12009	br-f08	20	51	247459	Hemmed_in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex_act so he can be supreme in at_least one area . 
12010	br-f08	21	52	247483	More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home . 
12011	br-f08	22	53	247511	Some psychologists , in_fact , suggest that career bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives . 
12012	br-f08	22	54	247533	The wife 's attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job . 
12013	br-f08	23	55	247568	Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative . 
12014	br-f08	23	56	247579	Unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated . 
12015	br-f08	23	57	247592	Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife 's mercy . 
12016	br-f08	24	58	247612	`` The pattern '' , says Dr._Morton_Schillinger , psychologist at New_York 's Lincoln_Institute_for_Psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night '' . 
12017	br-f08	25	59	247657	No one seriously contends , of_course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world . 
12018	br-f08	25	60	247680	After_all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as Dr._Schillinger points_out . 
12019	br-f08	25	61	247708	There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master_bedroom . 
12020	br-f08	26	62	247727	Furthermore , Dr._Calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around . 
12021	br-f08	26	63	247745	They are n't `` frigid '' and they are n't homosexual ; they 're just restrained in all of life . 
12022	br-f08	26	64	247766	They like to be dominated . 
12023	br-f08	26	65	247772	One such man once confided to Dr._Theodor_Reik , New_York psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor . 
12024	br-f08	26	66	247794	Asked why , he replied primly : 
12025	br-f08	26	67	247801	`` Because that 's no activity for a gentleman '' . 
12026	br-f08	27	68	247812	But such cases were , in the past , unusual . 
12027	br-f08	27	69	247823	Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male - even the Bible appears to endorse the concept . 
12028	br-f08	28	70	247844	Family survival on our own Western frontier , for_example , could quite literally depend_on a man 's strength and ability to bring_home_the_bacon ; and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed . 
12029	br-f08	29	71	247883	This carried_over into the more urbanized late 19 th and early 20 th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull_roaring Life_With_Father manner . 
12030	br-f08	30	72	247911	In those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere . 
12031	br-f08	30	73	247933	`` Grandma was n't expected to like it '' , Dr._Marion_Hilliard , the late Toronto gynecologist , once summed_up the attitude of the ' 90 s . 
12032	br-f08	30	74	247960	Wives of the period shamefacedly thought_of themselves as `` used '' by their husbands - and , history indicates , they often quite literally were . 
12033	br-f08	31	75	247986	When was the turning_point ? 
12034	br-f08	31	76	247991	When did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? 
12035	br-f08	32	77	248000	Some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub_gin . 
12036	br-f08	32	78	248032	Virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs . 
12037	br-f08	33	79	248056	Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male . 
12038	br-f08	33	80	248082	Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child rearing , money handling and home maintenance . 
12039	br-f08	33	81	248098	She found she could cope_with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless . 
12040	br-f08	33	82	248116	She liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up . 
12041	br-f08	34	83	248138	`` Very few wives '' , says Dr._Calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going_to become submissive where sex is concerned . 
12042	br-f08	34	84	248179	A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual_relationship as_well '' . 
12043	br-f08	35	85	248193	And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive - the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response . 
12044	br-f08	35	86	248220	Marriage manuals and women 's magazine_articles began to stress the importance of the female climax . 
12045	br-f08	35	87	248236	They began to describe in_detail the woman 's capacity for response . 
12046	br-f08	36	88	248248	In_fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr._Albert_Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men . 
12047	br-f08	36	89	248272	According to Dr._Ellis , the average 20 - year old American woman is capable of far greater sexual_arousal than her partner . 
12048	br-f08	36	90	248294	Not surprisingly , Dr._Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out_to claim these capabilities . 
12049	br-f08	37	91	248310	Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr._Maurice_Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing_up to them . 
12050	br-f08	37	92	248329	An aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle_under . 
12051	br-f08	37	93	248341	`` When the husband becomes passive in_the_face_of his wife 's aggressiveness '' , Dr._Linden says , `` the wife , in_turn , finds him inadequate . 
12052	br-f08	37	94	248367	Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction '' . 
12053	br-f08	38	95	248376	One such wife , Dr._Linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man . 
12054	br-f08	38	96	248406	But her personality was such_that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity . 
12055	br-f08	38	97	248429	Then the wife bed_hopped to the next on the list . 
12056	br-f08	39	98	248440	In some cases , however , domination of the sex_act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need . 
12057	br-f08	39	99	248466	Thus a man who is butting_a_stone_wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed - the one place he can still be champion . 
12058	br-f08	39	100	248491	If his on-the-job problems work_out , he may return to his old pattern . 
12059	br-f08	39	101	248505	Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep_over a man - or his wife - because he or she feels age creeping_up . 
12060	br-f08	40	102	248527	On_the_other_hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive - asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable . 
12061	br-f08	40	103	248558	Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted . 
12062	br-f08	41	104	248582	In_any_case , Dr._Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple 's own affair , and can n't always be measured by a general yardstick . 
12063	br-f08	41	105	248607	`` As_long_as the couple is in_agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates '' , Dr._Calderone declares . 
12064	br-f08	41	106	248634	`` The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' . 
12065	br-f08	42	107	248648	Other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage . 
12066	br-f08	42	108	248680	And just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband . 
12067	br-f08	43	109	248701	`` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr._Schillinger of the Lincoln_Institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps . 
12068	br-f08	43	110	248728	He must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish . 
12069	br-f08	43	111	248739	He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding '' ' . 
12070	br-f08	44	112	248758	Too many husbands , Dr._Schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they 're doing '' , and fear that their success depends_on some trick or technique of sexual play . 
12071	br-f13	1	1	248789	Farming is confining . 
12072	br-f13	1	2	248793	The farmer 's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock . 
12073	br-f13	2	3	248809	Livestock must be tended every_day , routinely . 
12074	br-f13	2	4	248817	A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens . 
12075	br-f13	3	5	248833	Even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing_season . 
12076	br-f13	4	6	248855	The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily . 
12077	br-f13	4	7	248867	He cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; such a move may mean a loss of capital . 
12078	br-f13	5	8	248892	Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of farm life . 
12079	br-f13	5	9	248905	The farmer must get_up early , and , at_times , work late at night . 
12080	br-f13	5	10	248920	Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain . 
12081	br-f13	5	11	248934	No_matter how well work is planned , bad_weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught_up . 
12082	br-f13	6	12	248954	It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably . 
12083	br-f13	7	13	248977	Production may fall far below expectations . 
12084	br-f13	7	14	248984	Drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops . 
12085	br-f13	7	15	248998	Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner 's earnings , even into his capital . 
12086	br-f13	8	16	249019	Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year . 
12087	br-f13	9	17	249034	The high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis . 
12088	br-f13	9	18	249055	Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities . 
12089	br-f13	9	19	249076	Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities . 
12090	br-f13	9	20	249095	If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high . 
12091	br-f13	10	21	249116	A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer . 
12092	br-f13	10	22	249146	It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment . 
12093	br-f13	10	23	249160	He may have_to depend_upon custom service for specialized operations , such_as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have_to wait his turn . 
12094	br-f13	10	24	249186	There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off farm job . 
12095	br-f13	11	25	249205	The farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost . 
12096	br-f13	11	26	249219	This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented . 
12097	br-f13	12	27	249231	If the farm is rented , the rent must be paid . 
12098	br-f13	12	28	249243	If it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free_of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take_care of . 
12099	br-f13	13	29	249275	A farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children . 
12100	br-f13	13	30	249286	It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air . 
12101	br-f13	13	31	249298	The children can do chores adapted to their age and ability . 
12102	br-f13	13	32	249310	Caring for a calf , a pig , or some chickens develops in children a sense_of_responsibility for work . 
12103	br-f13	14	33	249329	Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free_of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs . 
12104	br-f13	15	34	249363	For some retired_persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income . 
12105	br-f13	15	35	249378	It is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out_of_doors for their health . 
12106	br-f13	16	36	249395	Generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city . 
12107	br-f13	16	37	249412	The savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed . 
12108	br-f13	16	38	249426	Usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more . 
12109	br-f13	16	39	249451	Where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real_estate taxes are usually about the same . 
12110	br-f13	17	40	249480	A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare_time profitably . 
12111	br-f13	18	41	249492	Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational . 
12112	br-f13	18	42	249502	For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner . 
12113	br-f13	19	43	249521	Part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment - or a great_deal . 
12114	br-f13	19	44	249538	It depends_on the kind and the scale of the farming operation . 
12115	br-f13	20	45	249550	General requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below . 
12116	br-f13	20	46	249563	Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 . 
12117	br-f13	21	47	249580	Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs . 
12118	br-f13	21	48	249614	You could not , of_course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small . 
12119	br-f13	22	49	249631	If you want_to raise feed or carry_out some enterprise on a larger scale , you 'll need more land . 
12120	br-f13	23	50	249651	In deciding how much land you want , take_into_account the amount you 'll need to bring_in the income you expect . 
12121	br-f13	23	51	249672	But consider also how much you and your family can keep_up along with your other work . 
12122	br-f13	23	52	249689	The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision . 
12123	br-f13	23	53	249705	Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development . 
12124	br-f13	23	54	249720	This is a highly speculative venture . 
12125	br-f13	24	55	249727	Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract . 
12126	br-f13	24	56	249741	When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep_up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm . 
12127	br-f13	25	57	249782	If you have a year-round , full-time job you can n't expect to grow much more than your family uses - unless other members of the family do a good_deal of the work or you hire help . 
12128	br-f13	25	58	249820	As a rule , part-time farmers hire little help . 
12129	br-f13	26	59	249830	In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 . 
12130	br-f13	27	60	249866	List the number of hours the family can be expected to work each_month . 
12131	br-f13	27	61	249880	You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one . 
12132	br-f13	27	62	249895	Do not include all your spare_time or all your family 's spare_time - only what you are willing to use for farm work . 
12133	br-f13	28	63	249919	If you are going_to produce for home use only , you will need only hand_tools . 
12134	br-f13	28	64	249935	You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however . 
12135	br-f13	29	65	249949	For larger plantings , you 'll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating . 
12136	br-f13	29	66	249970	If you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $ 300 to $ 500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) . 
12137	br-f13	29	67	250005	These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing . 
12138	br-f13	30	68	250032	Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer . 
12139	br-f13	30	69	250047	If you are going_to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises . 
12140	br-f13	31	70	250076	You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs . 
12141	br-f13	31	71	250112	If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed - such_as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder - it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work . 
12142	br-f13	32	72	250149	Before you look_for a farm you 'll need_to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want_to undertake ; and ( 2 ) whether you want_to buy or rent . 
12143	br-f13	33	73	250182	Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture . 
12144	br-f13	34	74	250203	If you are not well acquainted_with the area in which you wish_to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy . 
12145	br-f13	35	75	250255	Discussed below are some of the main things to look_for when you select a part-time farm . 
12146	br-f13	36	76	250272	Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities . 
12147	br-f13	36	77	250289	Then if you change jobs you won n't necessarily have_to sell the farm . 
12148	br-f13	36	78	250303	The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable . 
12149	br-f13	37	79	250323	Obviously the farm should be on an all weather road . 
12150	br-f13	38	80	250334	If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby . 
12151	br-f13	38	81	250346	If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for_example , you should be close to a town or city . 
12152	br-f13	39	82	250369	Look_for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes . 
12153	br-f13	39	83	250379	There are slums in the country as_well as in the city . 
12154	br-f13	39	84	250391	Few rural_areas are protected by zoning . 
12155	br-f13	39	85	250398	A tavern , filling_station , junk_yard , rendering plant , or some other business may go_up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value . 
12156	br-f13	40	86	250426	Check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them . 
12157	br-f13	41	87	250449	Find_out whether fire protection , sewage_system , gas , water_mains , and electrical lines are available in the locality . 
12158	br-f13	41	88	250469	If these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more_than you expect . 
12159	br-f13	41	89	250486	You may have_to provide them yourself or get_along without them . 
12160	br-f13	42	90	250497	You cannot get_along without an adequate supply of pure water . 
12161	br-f13	42	91	250508	If you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well , find_out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled . 
12162	br-f13	42	92	250544	A pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden . 
12163	br-f13	42	93	250555	Pond water can be filtered for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so_much trouble . 
12164	br-f13	42	94	250577	The following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses . 
12165	br-f13	43	95	250592	Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? 
12166	br-f13	43	96	250604	If you can n't tell , get help from your county agricultural_agent or other local specialist . 
12167	br-f13	43	97	250621	Soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones . 
12168	br-f13	43	98	250641	Small areas that are n't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop . 
12169	br-f13	44	99	250664	Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence ? 
12170	br-f13	44	100	250680	How much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ? 
12171	br-f13	44	101	250693	If the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central_heating system must be installed , check_into the cost of making these improvements . 
12172	br-f13	45	102	250721	Its worth as a place to live . 
12173	br-f13	46	103	250729	The value of the products you can raise on it . 
12174	br-f13	47	104	250740	The possibilities of selling the property later_on for suburban subdivision . 
12175	br-f13	48	105	250751	Decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town . 
12176	br-f13	48	106	250778	Take_into_account the difference in city and county taxes , insurance rates , utility rates , and the cost of travel to work . 
12177	br-f13	49	107	250801	Next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm . 
12178	br-f13	49	108	250813	To do this , set_up a plan on_paper for operating the farm . 
12179	br-f13	49	109	250826	List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year . 
12180	br-f13	49	110	250845	Estimate the value of the produce at normal prices . 
12181	br-f13	49	111	250855	The total is the probable gross income from farming . 
12182	br-f13	50	112	250865	To find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming . 
12183	br-f13	50	113	250884	Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm_buildings and equipment . 
12184	br-f13	50	114	250896	Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family . 
12185	br-f13	50	115	250913	It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it . 
12186	br-f13	50	116	250931	Otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor . 
12187	br-f13	51	117	250948	To figure the value of the farm in_terms_of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way . 
12188	br-f14	1	1	250987	Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had_to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge . 
12189	br-f14	1	2	251010	For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned . 
12190	br-f14	1	3	251052	One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had_to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas_chambers . 
12191	br-f14	1	4	251073	The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten - the gas_chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star_of_David - nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . 
12192	br-f14	1	5	251111	Public_relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried_out : Too_much , too_much - the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . 
12193	br-f14	1	6	251169	And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had_to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . 
12194	br-f14	2	7	251210	Most_of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing_on the corpus_delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject_to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs . 
12195	br-f14	2	8	251245	Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . 
12196	br-f14	2	9	251270	Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? 
12197	br-f14	2	10	251297	Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr._Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies . 
12198	br-f14	2	11	251326	Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney_General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke_off the flow . 
12199	br-f14	3	12	251360	But there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New_York . 
12200	br-f14	3	13	251385	In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin 's dictatorship ; in the United_States the initiation of militant anti Communism , with the repentant ex Communist in the vanguard . 
12201	br-f14	3	14	251436	These trials were properly termed `` political cases '' in_that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences . 
12202	br-f14	3	15	251457	But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate ? 
12203	br-f14	3	16	251465	Of what new course could it mark the beginning ? 
12204	br-f14	3	17	251475	The Eichmann case looked_to the past , not to the future . 
12205	br-f14	3	18	251487	It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as_long_as there are Jews . 
12206	br-f14	3	19	251516	As_such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message '' . 
12207	br-f14	4	20	251534	`` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial '' - said Ben_Gurion , `` and not the Nazi regime alone - but anti-Semitism throughout history '' . 
12208	br-f14	4	21	251568	How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-Semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ? 
12209	br-f14	4	22	251601	And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all_but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend '' ? 
12210	br-f14	4	23	251638	These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . 
12211	br-f14	5	24	251651	It might be contended , of_course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism . 
12212	br-f14	5	25	251676	But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben_Gurion and set_forth in the indictment . 
12213	br-f14	5	26	251699	In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have_to be tied to the issue by argument . 
12214	br-f14	5	27	251722	One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages . 
12215	br-f14	5	28	251746	Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell_into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . 
12216	br-f14	5	29	251783	Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of_course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; but he believed in the Jew as enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things . 
12217	br-f14	5	30	251843	The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of_this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . 
12218	br-f14	5	31	251872	In regard_to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . 
12219	br-f14	5	32	251912	Perhaps under the guidance of_this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . 
12220	br-f14	5	33	251938	Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light_mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . 
12221	br-f14	5	34	252016	At_any_rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed_from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . 
12222	br-f14	6	35	252068	But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . 
12223	br-f14	6	36	252121	If anti-Semitism was on_trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department_of_Jewish_Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as_well_as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? 
12224	br-f14	6	37	252184	The infamous Wansee_Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put_to_death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich_Minister_of_the_Interior , the State_Secretary in_charge of the Four_Year_Plan , the Reich_Minister_of_Justice , the Under_Secretary_of_Foreign_Affairs . 
12225	br-f14	6	38	252243	The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government . 
12226	br-f14	6	39	252263	Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final_Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living_space through violence , economic_strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . 
12227	br-f14	6	40	252316	In_other_words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted_on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder . 
12228	br-f14	6	41	252370	This , in_fact , it turned_out to be . 
12229	br-f14	6	42	252379	Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed_forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of_it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's crimes ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually . 
12230	br-f14	7	43	252441	What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? 
12231	br-f14	7	44	252473	Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man_of_affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . 
12232	br-f14	7	45	252495	No_doubt many_of the citizens of the Third_Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today . 
12233	br-f14	7	46	252522	The Final_Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others . 
12234	br-f14	7	47	252544	Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once_and_for_all by showing how representative types of `` mere '' anti-Semites were drawn step_by_step into the program of skull bashings and gassings ? 
12235	br-f14	7	48	252579	The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' . 
12236	br-f14	7	49	252605	But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann 's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it . 
12237	br-f14	8	50	252637	Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states . 
12238	br-f14	8	51	252670	Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . 
12239	br-f14	8	52	252693	Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . 
12240	br-f14	8	53	252725	Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? 
12241	br-f14	8	54	252790	The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : 
12242	br-f14	8	55	252804	fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . 
12243	br-f14	8	56	252863	`` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations . 
12244	br-f14	8	57	252882	But though this characterization in_no_way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of_it . 
12245	br-f14	9	58	252915	Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final_Solution was aided by native Jew haters - i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia - and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity - Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? 
12246	br-f14	9	59	252987	Should not everyone have been awakened to_it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard_to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? 
12247	br-f14	9	60	253027	Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? 
12248	br-f14	10	61	253041	As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by_no_means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) . 
12249	br-f14	10	62	253096	Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin . 
12250	br-f14	10	63	253108	It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe . 
12251	br-f14	10	64	253132	It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; most_of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War_Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors ' accounts . 
12252	br-f15	1	1	253176	In Poughkeepsie , N._Y. , in 1952 , a Roman_Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned_Parenthood_Federation or to resign from the hospital staff . 
12253	br-f15	1	2	253206	Three agreed , but four declined and were suspended . 
12254	br-f15	1	3	253216	After a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 . 
12255	br-f15	1	4	253231	The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across_the_nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy . 
12256	br-f15	2	5	253252	In New_York_City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive_device . 
12257	br-f15	2	6	253277	He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman_Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . 
12258	br-f15	3	7	253309	A year later in Albany , N._Y. , a Roman_Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned_Parenthood_Association . 
12259	br-f15	3	8	253332	Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . 
12260	br-f15	4	9	253362	These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . 
12261	br-f15	4	10	253401	It has flared_up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family welfare agencies . 
12262	br-f15	4	11	253428	It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries . 
12263	br-f15	4	12	253451	Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment . 
12264	br-f15	5	13	253476	The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation . 
12265	br-f15	6	14	253507	The first_step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good_will and friendly communication on other_than the polemical level . 
12266	br-f15	6	15	253531	Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached . 
12267	br-f15	7	16	253574	`` All_too frequently '' , points_out James_O'_Gara , managing_editor of Commonweal , `` Catholics run_roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth_control has changed in recent decades '' . 
12268	br-f15	7	17	253628	All_too often our language is unduly harsh . 
12269	br-f15	8	18	253636	The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family_planning . 
12270	br-f15	8	19	253668	Instead of Catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed . 
12271	br-f15	8	20	253699	Family_planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring . 
12272	br-f15	9	21	253716	Pope_Pius_12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long_time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such_as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications '' . 
12273	br-f15	9	22	253771	This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring . 
12274	br-f15	10	23	253826	These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics in family_planning . 
12275	br-f15	10	24	253838	The laws of many states permit birth_control only for medical reasons . 
12276	br-f15	10	25	253850	The Roman_Catholic_Church , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy on family_planning . 
12277	br-f15	11	26	253864	Catholics , Protestants and Jews are in_agreement over the objectives of family_planning , but disagree over the methods to be used . 
12278	br-f15	11	27	253886	The Roman_Catholic_Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm_method , also_known_as the use of the infertile or safe period . 
12279	br-f15	11	28	253905	The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature 's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . 
12280	br-f15	11	29	253940	With the exception of the Roman_Catholic and the Orthodox_Catholic_Churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice . 
12281	br-f15	12	30	253970	Here is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement . 
12282	br-f15	12	31	253985	The grounds for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old_Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural_law . 
12283	br-f15	12	32	254028	The latter plays a prominent role in Roman_Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods . 
12284	br-f15	13	33	254056	The Roman_Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end . 
12285	br-f15	13	34	254092	This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God 's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements . 
12286	br-f15	14	35	254131	Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race . 
12287	br-f15	14	36	254155	Moreover , man may_not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception . 
12288	br-f15	14	37	254186	Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws_of_nature , Roman_Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them . 
12289	br-f15	15	38	254217	Let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman_Catholics appear to be irreconcilable . 
12290	br-f15	15	39	254238	But people differ in their religious_beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking_up_arms against those who disagree with them . 
12291	br-f15	15	40	254258	Why is it so different in regard_to birth_control ? 
12292	br-f15	15	41	254267	It is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at_least the practical consequences thereof , upon others . 
12293	br-f15	16	42	254299	It is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched_fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others . 
12294	br-f15	16	43	254330	Both Roman_Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past . 
12295	br-f15	17	44	254343	Consider what happened during World_War_1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress . 
12296	br-f15	17	45	254363	Many_of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful . 
12297	br-f15	17	46	254385	With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . 
12298	br-f15	17	47	254406	With the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens . 
12299	br-f15	17	48	254430	The attempt to enforce that belief ushered_in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history . 
12300	br-f15	17	49	254459	The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end . 
12301	br-f15	18	50	254471	That tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society . 
12302	br-f15	18	51	254502	That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard_to birth_control today . 
12303	br-f15	19	52	254515	Up_to the turn_of_the_century , contraception was condemned by all Christian_churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine_law . 
12304	br-f15	19	53	254534	This was generally reflected in the civil_laws of Christian countries . 
12305	br-f15	19	54	254545	Today , the Roman_Catholic and Orthodox_Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction . 
12306	br-f15	19	55	254559	The various Lambeth_Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken_place among Protestants generally . 
12307	br-f15	20	56	254579	In 1920 , the Lambeth_Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together_with the grave dangers - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' . 
12308	br-f15	20	57	254638	Denouncing the view that the sexual_union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded_as the governing considerations of Christian marriage . 
12309	br-f15	20	58	254670	One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . 
12310	br-f15	20	59	254711	The Conference called_for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives . 
12311	br-f15	21	60	254726	In 1930 , the Lambeth_Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate . 
12312	br-f15	22	61	254760	In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth_control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere . 
12313	br-f15	23	62	254777	Many other Protestant_denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action . 
12314	br-f15	23	63	254787	In March , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal_Council_of_Churches ratified artificial methods of birth_control . 
12315	br-f15	23	64	254809	`` As_to the necessity '' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question . 
12316	br-f15	23	65	254851	There is general_agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual_affection without relation_to procreation is right '' . 
12317	br-f15	24	66	254874	Since then , many Protestant_denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not_only approved birth_control , but declared it at_times to be a religious duty . 
12318	br-f15	24	67	254901	What determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive . 
12319	br-f15	24	68	254919	In_general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical . 
12320	br-f15	25	69	254937	This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National_Council_of_Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the US . 
12321	br-f15	25	70	254966	The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family_planning . 
12322	br-f15	25	71	254985	It called_for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives . 
12323	br-f15	26	72	255001	The general board declared : `` Most_of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right . 
12324	br-f15	26	73	255026	The general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' . 
12325	br-f15	27	74	255056	An action once universally condemned by all Christian_churches and forbidden by the civil_law is now not_only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant_denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty . 
12326	br-f15	27	75	255095	This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country . 
12327	br-f15	27	76	255112	Repeated polls have disclosed that most married_couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth_control . 
12328	br-f15	28	77	255129	For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far reaching . 
12329	br-f15	28	78	255165	To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . 
12330	br-f15	29	79	255203	This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief . 
12331	br-f15	29	80	255244	Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil_law is concerned with public crimes . 
12332	br-f15	29	81	255261	Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil_authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin . 
12333	br-f15	29	82	255292	Among the chief victims of such an ill_conceived imposition would be religion itself . 
12334	br-f16	1	1	255306	On April 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three masted bark , Discovery , weighed_anchor in St._Katherine's_Pool , London , and floated down the Thames toward_the_sea . 
12335	br-f16	1	2	255334	She carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North_America . 
12336	br-f16	2	3	255359	Seventeen months later , on September 6 , 1611 , an Irish fishing_boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway_Bay . 
12337	br-f16	2	4	255380	When she reached port , she was found to have on_board only eight men , all near starvation . 
12338	br-f16	2	5	255399	The captain was gone , and the mate was gone . 
12339	br-f16	2	6	255410	The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman . 
12340	br-f16	3	7	255425	What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months ? 
12341	br-f16	3	8	255435	What happened to the fourteen missing men ? 
12342	br-f16	3	9	255443	These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of_all_time . 
12343	br-f16	3	10	255455	For hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted_of ( 1 ) the captain 's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man 's desk on_board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports . 
12344	br-f16	3	11	255508	All_told , they offered a highly confused picture . 
12345	br-f16	4	12	255517	But since 1927 , researchers digging_into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information . 
12346	br-f16	4	13	255539	Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage . 
12347	br-f16	5	14	255563	Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations . 
12348	br-f16	5	15	255576	First , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma . 
12349	br-f16	5	16	255588	Second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain - a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on American towns and counties , on a great American river , and on half a_million square_miles of Arctic seas . 
12350	br-f16	6	17	255634	The name : Henry_Hudson . 
12351	br-f16	7	18	255639	This is the story of his last tragic voyage , as_nearly_as we are able - or ever , probably , will be able - to determine : 
12352	br-f16	8	19	255666	The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson 's fourth in four years . 
12353	br-f16	8	20	255681	Each time his objective had been the same - a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far_East . 
12354	br-f16	8	21	255701	In 1607 and 1608 , the English Muscovy_Company had sent him northward to look_for a route over the North_Pole or across the top of Russia . 
12355	br-f16	8	22	255727	Twice he had failed , and the Muscovy_Company indicated it would not back him again . 
12356	br-f16	9	23	255743	In 1609 , the Dutch_East_India_Company hired Hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the Half_Moon , and supplied him with Dutch sailors . 
12357	br-f16	9	24	255774	This time he turned westward , to the middle_Atlantic coast of North_America . 
12358	br-f16	9	25	255787	His chief discovery was important - the Great_North ( later , the Hudson ) River - but it produced no northwest passage . 
12359	br-f16	10	26	255810	When the Half_Moon put in at Dartmouth , England , in the fall of 1609 , word of Hudson 's findings leaked_out , and English interest in him revived . 
12360	br-f16	10	27	255840	The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship . 
12361	br-f16	10	28	255852	He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth . 
12362	br-f16	10	29	255867	By springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry , Prince_of_Wales . 
12363	br-f16	10	30	255886	He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded . 
12364	br-f16	11	31	255912	The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear . 
12365	br-f16	11	32	255921	A century of exploration had established that a great land_mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the_Indies . 
12366	br-f16	11	33	255943	One_by_one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded . 
12367	br-f16	11	34	255961	In_fact , Hudson 's sail up the Great_North_River had disposed of one of the last hopes . 
12368	br-f16	12	35	255978	But there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to_the_north . 
12369	br-f16	12	36	255990	Nearly twenty-five years before , Captain_John_Davis had noted , as he sailed near the Arctic_Circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as_it_were the meeting of tides '' . 
12370	br-f16	12	37	256025	He named this opening , between Baffin_Island and Labrador , the `` Furious_Overfall '' . 
12371	br-f16	12	38	256040	( Later , it was to be called Hudson_Strait . ) 
12372	br-f16	13	39	256051	In 1602 , George_Waymouth , in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back . 
12373	br-f16	13	40	256082	Hudson now proposed to sail all_the_way through and test the seas beyond for the long sought waterway . 
12374	br-f16	14	41	256100	Even Hudson , experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was , must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames . 
12375	br-f16	14	42	256124	Ahead were perilous , ice filled waters . 
12376	br-f16	14	43	256132	On previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain . 
12377	br-f16	14	44	256154	On the second voyage , he had turned_back at the frozen island of Novaya_Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free_will - which was obviously not the case . 
12378	br-f16	14	45	256192	On the third voyage , a near mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew_members on the Half_Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in mid Atlantic . 
12379	br-f16	15	46	256227	Worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before . 
12380	br-f16	15	47	256242	Of only one could he be sure - young John_Hudson , his second son . 
12381	br-f16	15	48	256257	The mate , Robert_Juet , who had kept the journal on the half_Moon , was experienced - but he was a bitter old_man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity . 
12382	br-f16	15	49	256290	Philip_Staffe , the ship 's carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent . 
12383	br-f16	15	50	256306	Arnold_Lodley and Michael_Perse were like the rest - lukewarm , ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis . 
12384	br-f16	16	51	256325	But men willing to sail at_all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find . 
12385	br-f16	16	52	256346	Hudson knew he had to use these men as_long_as he remained an explorer . 
12386	br-f16	16	53	256360	And he refused to be anything else . 
12387	br-f16	17	54	256368	It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy_Company and was trained on company ships . 
12388	br-f16	17	55	256389	He was a Londoner , married , with three sons . 
12389	br-f16	17	56	256400	( The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first_name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage . ) 
12390	br-f16	17	57	256424	In 1610 , Hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession . 
12391	br-f16	18	58	256452	Hudson 's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a_few miles down the Thames . 
12392	br-f16	18	59	256468	There at the river 's edge waited one Henry_Greene , whom Hudson listed as a `` clerk '' . 
12393	br-f16	18	60	256487	Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent , who had broken_with his parents in_order to keep the company he preferred - pimps , panders and whores . 
12394	br-f16	18	61	256516	He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on_board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend , where the Discovery picked him up . 
12395	br-f16	19	62	256545	For the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of Great_Britain , then turned westward . 
12396	br-f16	19	63	256565	On May 11 , she reached Iceland . 
12397	br-f16	19	64	256573	Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` Lousie_Bay '' . 
12398	br-f16	19	65	256590	The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome . 
12399	br-f16	19	66	256599	With Hudson looking_on , his protege Greene picked a fight with the ship 's surgeon , Edward_Wilson . 
12400	br-f16	19	67	256617	The issue was settled on_shore , Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing_boat back to England . 
12401	br-f16	19	68	256640	With difficulty , Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from Iceland . 
12402	br-f16	20	69	256657	Early in June , the Discovery passed `` Desolation '' ( southern Greenland ) and in mid-June entered the `` Furious_Overfall '' . 
12403	br-f16	20	70	256680	Floating ice bore_down from the north and west . 
12404	br-f16	20	71	256689	Fog hung over the route constantly . 
12405	br-f16	20	72	256696	Turbulent tides rose as_much_as fifty feet . 
12406	br-f16	20	73	256703	The ship 's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North_Pole . 
12407	br-f16	21	74	256718	As the bergs grew larger , Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava_Bay , an inlet of the great strait . 
12408	br-f16	21	75	256743	After finding that its coasts led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice filled passageway - and the crew , at_first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled . 
12409	br-f16	22	76	256778	The trouble was at_least partly Juet 's doing . 
12410	br-f16	22	77	256787	For weeks he had been saying that Hudson 's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd . 
12411	br-f16	22	78	256805	The great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason . 
12412	br-f16	22	79	256824	A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther . 
12413	br-f16	23	80	256838	Instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( Sir_Francis_Drake lopped a man 's head off under similar circumstances ) , Hudson decided to be reasonable . 
12414	br-f16	23	81	256872	He went_to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart , which he set_up in_view of the crew . 
12415	br-f16	23	82	256891	Patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives . 
12416	br-f16	24	83	256905	When Hudson had finished , the `` town_meeting '' broke_down into a general , wordy argument . 
12417	br-f16	24	84	256922	One man remarked that if he had a_hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in England . 
12418	br-f16	24	85	256944	Up spoke carpenter Staffe , who said he would n't give ten pounds to be home . 
12419	br-f16	24	86	256961	The statement was effective . 
12420	br-f16	24	87	256966	The meeting broke_up . 
12421	br-f16	24	88	256970	Hudson was free to sail on . 
12422	br-f16	25	89	256977	All through July the Discovery picked her way along the 450 - mile long strait , avoiding ice and rocky islands . 
12423	br-f16	25	90	256999	On August 3 , two massive headlands reared out of the mists - great gateways never before , so_far as Hudson knew , seen by Europeans . 
12424	br-f16	25	91	257026	To starboard was a cape a_thousand feet high , patched with ice and snow , populated by thousands of screaming sea_birds . 
12425	br-f16	25	92	257048	To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2000 feet . 
12426	br-f16	25	93	257065	Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme , for two of his backers . 
12427	br-f16	26	94	257079	Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called Hudson_Bay ) , confident he was on_his_way to the warm waters of the Pacific . 
12428	br-f16	26	95	257110	After three weeks ' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas . 
12429	br-f16	26	96	257131	The ship halted . 
12430	br-f16	26	97	257135	The great `` sea to the westwards '' was a dead_end . 
12431	br-f16	27	98	257147	This must have been Hudson 's blackest discovery . 
12432	br-f16	27	99	257156	For he seemed to sense at_once that before him was no South_Sea , but the solid bulk of the North_American continent . 
12433	br-f16	27	100	257178	This was the bitter_end , and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure . 
12434	br-f16	28	101	257194	Feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition . 
12435	br-f16	28	102	257204	North and south , east and west , back_and_forth he sailed in the land-locked bay , plowing furiously forward until land appeared , then turning to repeat the process , day_after_day , week_after_week . 
12436	br-f16	28	103	257238	Hundreds of miles to_the_north , the route back to England through the `` Furious_Overfall '' was again filling with ice . 
12437	br-f16	29	104	257259	The men were at_first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking . 
12438	br-f16	29	105	257272	Once_more , Juet 's complaints were the loudest . 
12439	br-f16	29	106	257281	Hudson 's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty . 
12440	br-f16	29	107	257292	Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial . 
12441	br-f16	30	108	257304	The trial was held September 10 . 
12442	br-f16	30	109	257311	Hudson , presiding , heard Juet 's defense , then called_for testimony from crew_members . 
12443	br-f16	30	110	257326	Juet had made plentiful enemies , several men stepped_forward . 
12444	br-f16	30	111	257336	Hands on Bible , seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins . 
12445	br-f16	30	112	257362	Cook_Bennett_Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship . 
12446	br-f16	30	113	257372	Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward . 
12447	br-f16	31	114	257384	Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay . 
12448	br-f16	31	115	257392	The new mate was Robert_Bylot , talented but inexperienced . 
12449	br-f16	31	116	257402	There were other shifts and pay_cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves . 
12450	br-f16	31	117	257417	The important result , however , was that Juet and Francis_Clemens , the deposed boatswain , became Hudson 's sworn enemies . 
12451	br-f16	32	118	257439	As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew 's respect for him . 
12452	br-f16	32	119	257460	Once , after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather , Hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed . 
12453	br-f16	32	120	257484	Just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship . 
12454	br-f16	32	121	257498	Michael_Butt and Adame_Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured . 
12455	br-f16	32	122	257510	The anchor cable would have been lost overboard , but Philip_Staffe was on_hand to sever it with his axe . 
12456	br-f17	1	1	257530	Thomas_Douglas , fifth Earl of Selkirk , a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red_River of the North . 
12457	br-f17	1	2	257569	Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , he purchased great blocks of the Company's stock with the view to controlling its policies . 
12458	br-f17	1	3	257600	Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116000 square_miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . 
12459	br-f17	1	4	257622	The grant , which stretched southward to Lake_Traverse - the headwaters of the Red - was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York_Factory on Hudson_Bay . 
12460	br-f17	1	5	257665	Thus at the same time that William_Henry_Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana_Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North_American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier . 
12461	br-f17	2	6	257711	Seven hundred miles south of York_Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 . 
12462	br-f17	2	7	257739	By October the little colony about Fort_Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 . 
12463	br-f17	2	8	257753	Within a_few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons . 
12464	br-f17	2	9	257782	The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great_Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War_of_1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . 
12465	br-f17	2	10	257820	Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go_to Red_River where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest_Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire . 
12466	br-f17	2	11	257859	The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . 
12467	br-f17	3	12	257890	It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward . 
12468	br-f17	3	13	257916	When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river . 
12469	br-f17	3	14	257952	Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort_Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland . 
12470	br-f17	3	15	257967	The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort_Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food . 
12471	br-f17	4	16	257993	The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders . 
12472	br-f17	4	17	258008	For many years the Northwest_Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie_du_Chien on the Mississippi_River , some 300 miles southeast of present-day St._Paul , Minnesota . 
12473	br-f17	4	18	258033	When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United_States , its British born employees , now become American citizens - Joseph_Rolette , Joseph_Renville and Alexis_Bailly - continued in the fur business . 
12474	br-f17	4	19	258071	On Big_Stone_Lake near the headwaters of the Red_River , Robert_Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian_Department of Canada , had a trading_post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces . 
12475	br-f17	4	20	258113	His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red_River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts . 
12476	br-f17	4	21	258135	These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander_Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun . 
12477	br-f17	4	22	258161	In 1802 Henry referred to `` our new carts '' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much_as a horse could pack . 
12478	br-f17	4	23	258190	They were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills . 
12479	br-f17	5	24	258210	It was Dickson who suggested to Lord_Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United_States . 
12480	br-f17	5	25	258230	In September 1817 at Fort_Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie_du_Chien . 
12481	br-f17	5	26	258259	During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United_States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red_River and that the United_States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England . 
12482	br-f17	5	27	258306	Upon arriving_at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John_Quincy_Adams , Secretary_of_State at Washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois_Territories '' . 
12483	br-f17	5	28	258334	This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at_first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements '' . 
12484	br-f17	6	29	258362	The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop_into a trade_route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected . 
12485	br-f17	6	30	258388	In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the Forks '' ( Fort_Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort_Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie_du_Chien . 
12486	br-f17	6	31	258421	It was a three month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats . 
12487	br-f17	6	32	258442	With these completed and ice gone from the St._Peter's_River ( present-day Minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to Big_Stone_Lake , across into Lake_Traverse , and down the Red . 
12488	br-f17	6	33	258499	They reached Fort_Douglas in June 1820 . 
12489	br-f17	6	34	258506	This epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk 1040 . 
12490	br-f17	6	35	258519	Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort_Daer for food . 
12491	br-f17	6	36	258539	Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round . 
12492	br-f17	7	37	258557	Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the United_State War_Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel_Henry_Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie_du_Chien , until then the most advanced United_States post . 
12493	br-f17	7	38	258599	In September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived_at the mouth of the St._Peter's_River , the head of navigation on the Mississippi , and began construction of Fort_St._Anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in_honor_of its commander , Colonel_Josiah_Snelling . 
12494	br-f17	8	39	258639	It was from the American outposts that Red_River shortages of livestock were to be made good . 
12495	br-f17	8	40	258656	Hercules_L._Dousman , fur trader and merchant at Prairie_du_Chien , contracted to supply Selkirk 's people with some 300 head of cattle , and Alexis_Bailly and Francois_Labothe were hired as drovers . 
12496	br-f17	8	41	258687	Bailly , after leaving Fort_Snelling in August 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson's_Bay_Company's post on Lake_Traverse `` in the Sieux_Country '' and reached Fort_Garry , as the Selkirk Hudson's_Bay_Company center was now called , late in the fall . 
12497	br-f17	8	42	258733	He set_out on his 700 - mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United_States . 
12498	br-f17	8	43	258758	Observing their distressing condition , Colonel_Snelling allowed these half starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation . 
12499	br-f17	9	44	258776	As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota , Dousman of Michilimackinac , Michigan , and Prairie_du_Chien was traveling_to Red_River to open a trade in merchandise . 
12500	br-f17	9	45	258812	Early in 1822 he was at Fort_Garry offering to bring_in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco . 
12501	br-f17	9	46	258830	Alexander_McDonnell , governor of Red_River , and James_Bird , a chief factor of the Hudson's_Bay_Company , ordered such `` sundry articles '' to a value of 4500 . 
12502	br-f17	10	47	258858	For its part the Hudson's_Bay_Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement . 
12503	br-f17	10	48	258872	As the time drew_near for the drawing of the British American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina_colony - its own post and Fort_Daer - was on American territory . 
12504	br-f17	10	49	258910	Accordingly Selkirk 's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by October , John_Halkett had torn_down both posts , floating the timber to `` the Forks '' in rafts . 
12505	br-f17	10	50	258942	`` I have done everything '' , he wrote , `` to break_up the whole of that unfortunate establishment '' . 
12506	br-f17	10	51	258963	Despite Company threats , duly carried_through , to cut_off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing_nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village . 
12507	br-f17	10	52	258991	They would attempt to bring supplies from St._Louis or Prairie_du_Chien at `` great expense as well as danger '' . 
12508	br-f17	11	53	259011	At Fort_Garry some of the_Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United_States , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort_Snelling . 
12509	br-f17	11	54	259039	The disasters of 1825 - 1826 caused more to leave . 
12510	br-f17	11	55	259050	After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick . 
12511	br-f17	11	56	259088	In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June . 
12512	br-f17	11	57	259105	On June 24 more than 400 families started the three month trip across the plains to the Mississippi . 
12513	br-f17	11	58	259124	By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort_Snelling , but most_of them were sent_on to Galena and St._Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United_States . 
12514	br-f17	11	59	259167	In 1837 , 157 Red_River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort_Snelling . 
12515	br-f17	12	60	259186	Below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi_River . 
12516	br-f17	12	61	259201	At the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father_Lucian_Galtier in 1840 . 
12517	br-f17	12	62	259225	Its people , including Pierre_Bottineau and other American_Fur_Company employees and the refugees from Fort_Garry , were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort_Snelling when Major_Joseph_Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840 . 
12518	br-f17	12	63	259261	The resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father_Galtier 's mission , St._Paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take_on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red_River . 
12519	br-f17	13	64	259305	While population at Fort_Garry increased rapidly , from 2417 in 1831 to 4369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate . 
12520	br-f17	13	65	259331	Accordingly , though the practice violated the no trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's_Bay_Company , some settlers went into trade . 
12521	br-f17	13	66	259364	The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought_in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain_from trading in furs . 
12522	br-f17	13	67	259394	Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort_Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . 
12523	br-f17	13	68	259413	In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per_cent duty on imports via Hudson's_Bay which were viewed_as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' . 
12524	br-f17	13	69	259450	To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company 's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain_from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . 
12525	br-f17	14	70	259480	With their customary source of supply cut_off , the Fort_Garry free_traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . 
12526	br-f17	14	71	259504	Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St._Paul and goods from St._Paul to Red_River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement . 
12527	br-f17	14	72	259543	This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per_cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per_cent on the initiative of the London committee . 
12528	br-f17	15	73	259584	The trade in a_few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49 th parallel . 
12529	br-f18	1	1	259611	The letters of the common_soldiers are rich_in humor . 
12530	br-f18	1	2	259620	Indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray . 
12531	br-f18	1	3	259651	Some of their figures_of_speech were colorful and expressive . 
12532	br-f18	1	4	259660	A Confederate observed that the Yankees were : `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' . 
12533	br-f18	1	5	259682	Another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat_house '' . 
12534	br-f18	1	6	259703	A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' . 
12535	br-f18	2	7	259719	Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression . 
12536	br-f18	2	8	259727	One wrote : `` [ I am so hungry ] I could eat a rider off his horse + snap_at the stirups '' . 
12537	br-f18	2	9	259751	A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia `` look_like the latter end of original_sin and hard_times '' . 
12538	br-f18	2	10	259771	A third remarked of slowness of Southerners : `` They moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god '' . 
12539	br-f18	2	11	259805	Still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote : `` Yore letter was short_and_sweet , jist like a roasted maget '' . 
12540	br-f18	2	12	259833	A Yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart : `` My girl is none of your one-horse girls . 
12541	br-f18	2	13	259854	She is a regular stub_and_twister , double_geered . 
12542	br-f18	2	14	259862	She is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and Union from the muzzle to the crupper '' . 
12543	br-f18	3	15	259883	Humor found many modes of expression . 
12544	br-f18	3	16	259890	A Texan wrote to a male companion at home : `` What has become of Halda and Laura ? 
12545	br-f18	3	17	259909	When you see them again give them my love - not best respects now , but love by God '' . 
12546	br-f18	3	18	259930	William_R._Stillwell , an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the Georgia_Department_of_Archives_and_History , liked to tease his wife in his letters . 
12547	br-f18	3	19	259953	After he had been away from home about a year he wrote : `` [ Dear Wife ] If I did not write and receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married I do n't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar_as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so forgitful '' . 
12548	br-f18	3	20	260026	A Yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote : `` I am growing so fat I am a burden 2 myself '' . 
12549	br-f18	3	21	260051	Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer : 
12550	br-f18	3	22	260059	`` Now I lay me down to sleep , The gray-backs o ' er my body creep ; If they should bite before I wake , I pray the Lord their jaws to break '' `` . 
12551	br-f18	4	23	260096	Charles_Thiot , a splendid Georgia soldier , differed from most_of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of_age . 
12552	br-f18	4	24	260130	But he was very_much_like his associates in his hatred of camp routine . 
12553	br-f18	4	25	260143	Near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups , name one of them `` fall-in '' and the other `` close-up '' , and_then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of ' fall-in ' and ' close-up '' ' . 
12554	br-f18	5	26	260201	The soldiers who comprised the rank_and_file of the Civil_War armies were an earthy people . 
12555	br-f18	5	27	260216	They talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body . 
12556	br-f18	5	28	260229	One of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea . 
12557	br-f18	5	29	260240	Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness_of_the_bowels '' ; but a much more common designation was `` the_sh-ts '' . 
12558	br-f18	5	30	260265	A Michigan soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864 : `` I expect to be tough as a knott as_soon_as I get_over the Georgia Shitts '' . 
12559	br-f18	5	31	260292	Johnny_Rebs from the deep_South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the `` the Virginia quickstep '' . 
12560	br-f18	6	32	260323	A Georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea : `` I have bin a_little sick with diorah two or three days . 
12561	br-f18	6	33	260353	I eat too_much eggs and poark it sowered [ on ] my stomack and turn loose on me '' . 
12562	br-f18	6	34	260373	A Michigan soldier wrote his brother : `` I am well at_present with the exception I have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find you the same '' . 
12563	br-f18	7	35	260405	The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances . 
12564	br-f18	7	36	260419	Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing_desk or table . 
12565	br-f18	7	37	260440	Most_of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum_heads , or the knee . 
12566	br-f18	7	38	260464	In the South , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor . 
12567	br-f18	7	39	260483	Scarcity of paper caused many Southerners to adopt the practice of cross writing , i._e. , after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written . 
12568	br-f18	7	40	260532	Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads . 
12569	br-f18	7	41	260544	A Yank writing from Vicksburg , May 28 , 1863 , stated `` Not less_than 50 balls have passed_over me since I commenced writing . 
12570	br-f18	7	42	260569	I could tell you of plenty narrow_escapes , but we take no notice of them now '' . 
12571	br-f18	7	43	260587	A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed his mother : `` I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often , for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter . 
12572	br-f18	7	44	260622	Just count each blot a dodge and add in a_few for I do n't dodge every time '' . 
12573	br-f18	7	45	260641	Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta reported : `` The Yankees keep Shooting so I am afraid they will knock_over my ink , so I will close '' . 
12574	br-f18	8	46	260672	The most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives . 
12575	br-f18	8	47	260687	But fathers often addressed communications to their small children ; and these , full of homely advice , are among the most human and revealing of Civil_War letters . 
12576	br-f18	8	48	260716	Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community . 
12577	br-f18	8	49	260736	Occasionally they would write to the slaves . 
12578	br-f18	8	50	260744	Early in the war it was not uncommon for planters ' sons to retain in camp Negro `` body_servants '' to perform the menial chores such_as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes . 
12579	br-f18	8	51	260785	Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners ' families . 
12580	br-f18	9	52	260813	Unmarried soldiers carried_on correspondence with sweethearts at home . 
12581	br-f18	9	53	260822	Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19_th century America , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling . 
12582	br-f18	10	54	260845	Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond , Petersburg , Washington , or Nashville . 
12583	br-f18	10	55	260871	But these comments are hardly printable . 
12584	br-f18	10	56	260878	An Alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the Virginia belles : `` They thout I was a saint . 
12585	br-f18	10	57	260908	I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all . 
12586	br-f18	10	58	260920	I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five of my Negroes had run_away and ten of Pappies But I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and_then they would lean to me like a sore_eyd kitten to a basin of milk '' . 
12587	br-f18	11	59	260977	Some of the letters were pungently expressive . 
12588	br-f18	11	60	260985	An Ohio soldier who , from a comrade just returned from leave , received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , took pen in hand and delivered himself thus : `` [ Dear Sis ] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was a runing together all_the_time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no_more yuse . 
12589	br-f18	11	61	261059	I think you made a dam good chouise to turn_off as nise a feler as Alf_dyer and let that orney thefin , drunkard , damed card_playing Sun_of_a_bich com to Sea you , the god_damed theaf and lop_yeard pigen_tode helion , he is too orney for hel . 
12590	br-f18	11	62	261106	i will Shute him as_shore_as i Sea him '' . 
12591	br-f18	12	63	261116	Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions . 
12592	br-f18	12	64	261132	A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia : `` Dear Pa . 
12593	br-f18	12	65	261151	Went_out a Skouting yesterday . 
12594	br-f18	12	66	261156	We got to one house where there were five secessionist they brok + run and Arch holored_out to shoot the ornery suns_of_biches and we all let_go at them . 
12595	br-f18	12	67	261185	Thay may say what they please but godamit Pa it is fun '' . 
12596	br-f18	13	68	261199	Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers . 
12597	br-f18	13	69	261217	A Mississippi soldier wrote : `` Our General_Reub_Davis is a vain , stuck-up , illiterate ass '' . 
12598	br-f18	13	70	261235	An Alabamian wrote : `` Col._Henry is [ an ignoramus ] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn '' . 
12599	br-f18	13	71	261257	A Floridian stated that his officers were `` not fit to tote_guts_to_a_bear '' . 
12600	br-f18	13	72	261271	On December 9 , 1862 , Sergeant_Edwin_H._Fay , an unusual Louisianan who held A._B. and M._A. degrees from Harvard_University and who before the war was headmaster of a private_school for boys in Louisiana , wrote his wife : 
12601	br-f18	13	73	261309	`` I saw Pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw . 
12602	br-f18	13	74	261324	His head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps . 
12603	br-f18	13	75	261340	Jackson runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader . 
12604	br-f18	13	76	261354	He is not worth shucks . 
12605	br-f18	13	77	261360	But he is a West_Point graduate and therefore must be born to command '' . 
12606	br-f18	14	78	261375	Similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers . 
12607	br-f18	14	79	261390	A Massachusetts soldier , who seems to have been a Civil_War version of Bill_Mauldin , wrote : `` The officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks . 
12608	br-f18	14	80	261426	They get all the glory and most_of the pay and do n't earn ten cents apiece on_the_average , the drunken rascals '' . 
12609	br-f18	14	81	261449	Private George_Gray_Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote : `` I am well convinced in My own Mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago '' . 
12610	br-f18	14	82	261480	Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state : `` I wish to God one_half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against [ the other half ] '' . 
12611	br-f18	15	83	261514	No group of officers came_in_for more spirited denunciation than the doctors . 
12612	br-f18	15	84	261526	One Federal_soldier wrote : `` The docters is no_a_conte . 
12613	br-f18	15	85	261536	hell will be filde with do_[_c_]_ters and offersey when this war is over '' . 
12614	br-f18	15	86	261551	Shortly after the beginning of Sherman 's Georgia campaign , an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk : `` The surgeon insisted on Sending me to the hospital for treatment . 
12615	br-f18	15	87	261581	I insisted on takeing_the_field and prevailed - thinking that I had_better die by rebel bullets than [ by ] Union quackery '' . 
12616	br-f18	16	88	261604	The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very_much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred . 
12617	br-f18	16	89	261634	The Rebs were , to a Massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madmen or not men at_all but whiskey + gunpowder put into a human frame '' . 
12618	br-f18	16	90	261661	A Pennsylvania soldier wrote that `` they were the hardest looking set of men that Ever i saw they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings '' . 
12619	br-f18	16	91	261693	Private Jenkins_Lloyd_Jones of the Wisconsin_Light_Artillery wrote in his diary : `` I strolled among the Alabamans on the right , found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe their ignorance being little less_than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect ' They Recooned as how you ' uns all would be a heap wus to we ' uns all '' ' . 
12620	br-f18	16	92	261762	In a similar vein , but writing from the opposite side , Thomas_Taylor , a private in the 6_th Alabama_Volunteers , in a letter to his wife , stated : `` You know that my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe By a set of cowardly Skunks whose Motto is Booty . 
12621	br-f20	1	1	261833	As part of the same arrangement , Torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good_will , and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign , bestowed upon O_'_Banion a third share in the Hawthorne_Smoke_Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade . 
12622	br-f20	1	2	261882	The coalition was to prove inadvisable . 
12623	br-f20	2	3	261889	O_'_Banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright_blue eyes stared with a kind_of frozen candour into others ' . 
12624	br-f20	2	4	261910	He had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in_place even when he was pumping bullets into someone 's body . 
12625	br-f20	2	5	261939	He carried three guns - one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket - and was equally lethal with both hands . 
12626	br-f20	2	6	261973	He killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately . 
12627	br-f20	2	7	261982	The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them . 
12628	br-f20	2	8	262001	Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol . 
12629	br-f20	2	9	262011	He was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths . 
12630	br-f20	2	10	262027	He had no apparent comprehension of morality ; he divided humanity into `` right guys '' and `` wrong guys '' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under . 
12631	br-f20	2	11	262063	He had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality '' . 
12632	br-f20	2	12	262078	He walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns . 
12633	br-f20	2	13	262112	Landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly '' but he was , in_fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath . 
12634	br-f20	2	14	262148	He was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king . 
12635	br-f20	3	15	262187	O_'_Banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer , in the North_Side 's Little_Hell , close by the Sicilian quarter and Death_Corner . 
12636	br-f20	3	16	262215	He had been a choir_boy at the Holy_Name_Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father_O_'_Brien . 
12637	br-f20	3	17	262232	The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy_houses , honkytonks , and sawdust_saloons of his birthplace ; he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went_through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police dodging , and housebreaking . 
12638	br-f20	3	18	262285	At the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop , he was knocked_down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg . 
12639	br-f20	3	19	262316	Because of this he was known_as Gimpy ( but , as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface , never in his presence ) . 
12640	br-f20	3	20	262341	In his teens O_'_Banion was enrolled in the vicious Market_Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's_Cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North_Clark_Street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown_out . 
12641	br-f20	3	21	262387	He then got a job with the Chicago_Herald-Examiner as a circulation_slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper 's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors . 
12642	br-f20	3	22	262419	He was also at_the_same_time gaining practical experience as a safe_breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene_Geary , later committed to Chester_Asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor . 
12643	br-f20	4	23	262480	O_'_Banion 's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell_Prison for three months for burglary ; two years later he served another three months for assault . 
12644	br-f20	4	24	262517	Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery . 
12645	br-f20	4	25	262548	But by now O_'_Banion 's political pull was beginning to be effective . 
12646	br-f20	4	26	262561	On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $ 10000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle_prossed . 
12647	br-f20	4	27	262584	On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come_upon by a Detective_Sergeant_John_J._Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal_Telegraph_Building ; the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $ 30000 in bribes , it was estimated . 
12648	br-f20	4	28	262639	As promptly as Torrio , O_'_Banion jumped into bootlegging . 
12649	br-f20	4	29	262649	He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians , but he had his huge North_Side portion to exploit and he made a great_deal of money . 
12650	br-f20	4	30	262680	Unlike the Sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution . 
12651	br-f20	4	31	262702	He was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 O_'_Banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state : `` I always deliver my borough as per requirements '' . 
12652	br-f20	5	32	262737	But whose requirements ? 
12653	br-f20	5	33	262741	Until 1924 O_'_Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North_Side domain solidly Democratic . 
12654	br-f20	5	34	262756	There was a question and answer gag that went_around at that time : Q. `` Who 'll carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards '' ? 
12655	br-f20	5	35	262781	A. `` O_'_Banion , in his pistol pocket '' . 
12656	br-f20	5	36	262791	But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O_'_Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans . 
12657	br-f20	5	37	262824	To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O_'_Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay . 
12658	br-f20	6	38	262858	The reception was held in a private dining_room of the Webster_Hotel on Lincoln_Park_West . 
12659	br-f20	6	39	262872	It was an interesting fraternisation of ex convicts , union racketeers , ward_heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen . 
12660	br-f20	6	40	262892	The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time . 
12661	br-f20	6	41	262912	It included the top O_'_Banion men and Chief_of_Detectives_Michael_Hughes . 
12662	br-f20	7	42	262921	When Mayor_Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police_department by consorting with these felons and fixers . 
12663	br-f20	7	43	262949	Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry_O_'_Connor , the proprieter of a Loop gambling_house . 
12664	br-f20	7	44	262972	`` But when I arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective bureau basement half_a_dozen times , I knew I had been framed , and withdrew almost at_once '' . 
12665	br-f20	8	45	263008	In_fact , O_'_Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $ 2500 diamond stickpin . 
12666	br-f20	8	46	263026	There was a brief interruption while one of O_'_Banion 's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip . 
12667	br-f20	8	47	263056	Then O_'_Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds . 
12668	br-f20	9	48	263070	This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek_by_jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . 
12669	br-f20	9	49	263145	Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928_-_29 '' . 
12670	br-f20	10	50	263177	However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . 
12671	br-f20	10	51	263189	O_'_Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal . 
12672	br-f20	10	52	263211	On Election_Day - November 4 - he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes . 
12673	br-f20	10	53	263235	The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates . 
12674	br-f20	11	54	263245	This further demonstration of O_'_Banion 's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone . 
12675	br-f20	11	55	263260	In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self_aggrandisement for their liking . 
12676	br-f20	11	56	263280	He behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness . 
12677	br-f20	11	57	263312	They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado - as , when his bodyguard , Yankee_Schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by Dave_Miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were Hirschey , a gambler politician in loose beer running league with Torrio and O_'_Banion , Frank , a policeman , and Max , the youngest . 
12678	br-f20	11	58	263383	To settle this slight , O_'_Banion went down to the La_Salle_Theatre in the Loop , where , he had learned , Dave_Miller was attending the opening of a musical_comedy . 
12679	br-f20	11	59	263413	At the end of the performance , Dave and Max came_out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first_nighters . 
12680	br-f20	11	60	263438	O_'_Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach . 
12681	br-f20	11	61	263454	A second bullet ricocheted off Max 's belt_buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress . 
12682	br-f20	11	62	263471	O_'_Banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre ; he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested . 
12683	br-f20	11	63	263491	That sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of Torrio and Capone , was a nonsense . 
12684	br-f20	12	64	263514	A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held_up a Torrio beer convoy on a West_Side street and demanded $ 300 to let it through . 
12685	br-f20	12	65	263545	One of the beer runners telephoned O_'_Banion - on a line tapped by the detective bureau - and reported the situation . 
12686	br-f20	12	66	263567	O_'_Banion 's reaction was : 
12687	br-f20	12	67	263572	`` Three_hundred dollars ! 
12688	br-f20	12	68	263576	To them bums ? 
12689	br-f20	12	69	263580	Why , I can get them knocked_off for half that_much '' . 
12690	br-f20	12	70	263592	Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if O_'_Banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen . 
12691	br-f20	12	71	263617	But in_the_meantime the beer runner , unhappy with this solution , telephoned Torrio and returned to O_'_Banion with the message : `` Say , Dionie , I just been talking to Johnny , and he said to let them cops have the three_hundred . 
12692	br-f20	12	72	263661	He says he do n't want no trouble '' . 
12693	br-f20	13	73	263671	But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman . 
12694	br-f20	13	74	263685	For three years , since the liquor territorial conference , Torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated O_'_Banion 's impudent double-crossing . 
12695	br-f20	13	75	263725	They had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in Cicero . 
12696	br-f20	14	76	263742	When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O_'_Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $ 20000 a month . 
12697	br-f20	14	77	263784	In six months O_'_Banion had boosted the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . 
12698	br-f20	14	78	263816	These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; once_again O_'_Banion 's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill_will . 
12699	br-f20	14	79	263860	The revenue from O_'_Banion 's Cicero territory went_up still higher , until the yield was more_than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago 's South and West_Sides . 
12700	br-f20	14	80	263892	But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate . 
12701	br-f20	14	81	263904	At_last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O_'_Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in_return for one from his Cicero beer concession . 
12702	br-f20	14	82	263939	O_'_Banion 's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal . 
12703	br-f20	15	83	263951	Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O_'_Banion gang 's seizure from a West_Side marshalling_yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth $ 100000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition_era - the Sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation . 
12704	br-f20	15	84	264004	Here was stored $ 1000000 worth of bonded whisky . 
12705	br-f20	15	85	264014	These 1750 cases were carted_off in a one night operation by the O_'_Banion men , who left in their stead the same number of barrels filled with water . 
12706	br-f21	1	1	264043	A tsunami may be started by a sea_bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic_eruption . 
12707	br-f21	1	2	264059	The most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883 ; it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far_away as San_Francisco . 
12708	br-f21	2	3	264112	The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves . 
12709	br-f21	2	4	264123	Whether or not Plato 's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times . 
12710	br-f21	2	5	264155	Indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian_Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood . 
12711	br-f21	3	6	264185	One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1 , 1755 ; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far_away as the English coast . 
12712	br-f21	3	7	264220	Tsunami are rare , however , in the Atlantic_Ocean ; they are far more common in the Pacific . 
12713	br-f21	3	8	264239	Japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 . 
12714	br-f21	3	9	264254	The Hawaiian_Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years . 
12715	br-f21	4	10	264267	In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland_Sea ; one wave swamped more than 1000 ships and boats in Osaka_Bay . 
12716	br-f21	4	11	264296	A tsunami in the Hawaiian_Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( Ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been . 
12717	br-f21	4	12	264324	In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 27000 people and swept_away 10000 homes . 
12718	br-f21	5	13	264337	The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards_of_measurement . 
12719	br-f21	5	14	264348	An ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a_few hundred feet long from crest to crest - no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1000 feet in the Pacific . 
12720	br-f21	5	15	264380	But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest . 
12721	br-f21	5	16	264401	While a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles_per_hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles_per_hour . 
12722	br-f21	5	17	264430	The greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave ; Lagrange 's law says that its velocity is equal to the square_root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due_to gravity . 
12723	br-f21	5	18	264471	In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles_per_hour . 
12724	br-f21	6	19	264487	Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable . 
12725	br-f21	6	20	264506	Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest . 
12726	br-f21	6	21	264520	Usually it is only_when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build_up to their terrifying heights . 
12727	br-f21	6	22	264539	On the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan , fishermen at_sea noticed no unusual swells . 
12728	br-f21	6	23	264559	Not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened . 
12729	br-f21	6	24	264591	The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore . 
12730	br-f21	7	25	264624	The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones . 
12731	br-f21	7	26	264638	They usually range from 20 to 60 feet in_height , but when they pour into a V shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions . 
12732	br-f21	8	27	264666	Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers . 
12733	br-f21	8	28	264691	This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives . 
12734	br-f21	8	29	264711	Reefs are left high_and_dry , and the beaches are covered with stranded fish . 
12735	br-f21	8	30	264725	At Hilo large_numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach . 
12736	br-f21	8	31	264742	Many_of them paid for their curiosity with their lives , for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore . 
12737	br-f21	8	32	264765	After an earthquake in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground . 
12738	br-f21	8	33	264795	When a second quake came , they dashed back to the beach , fearing that they might be buried under landslides . 
12739	br-f21	8	34	264817	Just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them . 
12740	br-f21	9	35	264832	A tsunami is not a single wave but a series . 
12741	br-f21	9	36	264843	The waves are separated by intervals of 15_minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all_over . 
12742	br-f21	9	37	264884	The waves may keep coming for many hours . 
12743	br-f21	9	38	264893	Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest . 
12744	br-f21	10	39	264907	Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was Francis_P._Shepard of the Scripps_Institution_of_Oceanography , one of the world 's foremost marine geologists . 
12745	br-f21	10	40	264931	He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves . 
12746	br-f21	10	41	264943	Their onrush and retreat , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing , roaring and rattling . 
12747	br-f21	10	42	264962	The third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest . 
12748	br-f21	10	43	264973	On some of the islands ' beaches the waves came_in gently ; they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come . 
12749	br-f21	10	44	265004	In Hilo_Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high . 
12750	br-f21	10	45	265015	The highest waves , 55 feet , occurred at Pololu_Valley . 
12751	br-f21	11	46	265026	Scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon . 
12752	br-f21	11	47	265038	During a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night . 
12753	br-f21	11	48	265051	The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca_miliaris by the turbulence of the sea . 
12754	br-f21	11	49	265081	Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ; the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance . 
12755	br-f21	11	50	265120	The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami_Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3000 feet . 
12756	br-f21	11	51	265150	Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands . 
12757	br-f21	12	52	265159	The tsunami warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander_C._K._Green of the Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey staff . 
12758	br-f21	12	53	265186	It consists_of a series of pipes and a pressure measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface . 
12759	br-f21	12	54	265208	Ordinary water tides are disregarded . 
12760	br-f21	12	55	265214	But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set_in_motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric_circuit . 
12761	br-f21	12	56	265248	This in_turn sets_off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress . 
12762	br-f21	12	57	265267	Such equipment has been installed at Hilo , Midway , Attu and Dutch_Harbor . 
12763	br-f21	12	58	265281	The moment the alarm goes_off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system . 
12764	br-f21	13	59	265303	This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast_Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs . 
12765	br-f21	13	60	265324	Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami . 
12766	br-f21	13	61	265347	By means of charts showing wave travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time_of_arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under_way at any spot in the Pacific . 
12767	br-f21	13	62	265390	The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps . 
12768	br-f21	13	63	265413	All_of these activities are geared to a top priority communication_system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly . 
12769	br-f21	14	64	265438	Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence . 
12770	br-f21	14	65	265459	On November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka_Peninsula . 
12771	br-f21	14	66	265475	At 17_:_07 that afternoon ( Greenwich_time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu . 
12772	br-f21	14	67	265493	The warning system immediately went into action . 
12773	br-f21	14	68	265501	Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake 's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude . 
12774	br-f21	14	69	265537	While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came_in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military_services and the police that the first big wave would arrive_at Honolulu at 23_:_30 Greenwich_time . 
12775	br-f21	15	70	265590	It turned_out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 . 
12776	br-f21	15	71	265603	They hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu_Harbor , knocked_down telephone_lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows . 
12777	br-f21	15	72	265627	But not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the Hawaiian_Islands did not exceed $ 800000 . 
12778	br-f21	15	73	265648	There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage . 
12779	br-f21	16	74	265663	But it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough . 
12780	br-f21	16	75	265679	In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts , or at_least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves . 
12781	br-f21	17	76	265715	The key to the world of geology is change ; nothing remains the same . 
12782	br-f21	17	77	265730	Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man . 
12783	br-f21	17	78	265747	The land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of_this . 
12784	br-f21	17	79	265762	Earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break . 
12785	br-f21	17	80	265775	Sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface ; often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there ; and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried . 
12786	br-f21	17	81	265812	Today 's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth 's restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them . 
12787	br-f21	18	82	265849	The effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized . 
12788	br-f21	18	83	265863	The role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster . 
12789	br-f21	18	84	265892	Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports . 
12790	br-f21	19	85	265902	We have learned from earthquakes much of_what we now know about the earth 's interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled . 
12791	br-f21	19	86	265938	These waves have shown that 1800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in_turn , has a solid inner core . 
12792	br-f21	20	87	265965	Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths . 
12793	br-f21	20	88	265985	Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts . 
12794	br-f21	20	89	265994	( 1 ) As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do . 
12795	br-f21	20	90	266035	( 2 ) If earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? 
12796	br-f21	21	91	266050	Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields . 
12797	br-f21	21	92	266063	In the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources . 
12798	br-f21	21	93	266098	We have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate . 
12799	br-f21	22	94	266120	The following discussion of_this subject has been adapted from the book Causes_of_Catastrophe by L._Don_Leet . 
12800	br-f21	23	95	266135	At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday , April 18 , 1906 , San_Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake . 
12801	br-f21	23	96	266159	A sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll . 
12802	br-f22	1	1	266169	In Ireland 's County_Limerick , near the River_Shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen , which means `` Garden of Owen '' . 
12803	br-f22	1	2	266198	Undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name . 
12804	br-f22	1	3	266228	The cry `` Garryowen '' ! 
12805	br-f22	1	4	266234	bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes , Sioux and Apaches , Mexican banditos under Pancho_Villa , Japanese in the South_Pacific , and Chinese and North_Korean Communists in Korea . 
12806	br-f22	1	5	266279	Garryowen is the battle_cry of the 7_th_U._S._Cavalry_Regiment , `` The Fighting_Seventh '' . 
12807	br-f22	2	6	266292	Today a battle_cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern Army , esprit_de_corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables . 
12808	br-f22	2	7	266316	But do n't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting_Seventh , especially in a saloon on Saturday night . 
12809	br-f22	3	8	266336	Of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7_th_Cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than Lieutenant_Colonel_Melbourne_C._Chandler . 
12810	br-f22	3	9	266359	Wiry and burr_headed , with steel_blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper . 
12811	br-f22	3	10	266382	The truth is , however , that when Mel_Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel_chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil . 
12812	br-f22	4	11	266418	Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical_Service_Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas_City_Medical_Depot when he decided that if he was going_to make the Army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it . 
12813	br-f22	4	12	266460	Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk_officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces . 
12814	br-f22	4	13	266485	The next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding_officer of Troop_H , 7_th_Cavalry , in_the_middle of corps maneuvers in Japan . 
12815	br-f22	5	14	266509	Outside of combat , he could n't have landed in a tougher spot . 
12816	br-f22	5	15	266523	First_of_all , no unit likes to have a new CO brought_in from the outside , especially when he 's an armchair trooper . 
12817	br-f22	5	16	266546	Second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull_the_rug_out_from_under him , it 's on maneuvers . 
12818	br-f22	5	17	266564	In combat , helping your CO make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed . 
12819	br-f22	5	18	266581	But in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all_the_time , it 's easy . 
12820	br-f22	6	19	266597	Chandler understood this and expected the worst . 
12821	br-f22	6	20	266605	But his first few days with Troop_H were full of surprises , beginning with First_Sergeant_Robert_Early . 
12822	br-f22	6	21	266621	Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice . 
12823	br-f22	6	22	266633	Instead Sergeant_Early was quiet , sharp and confident . 
12824	br-f22	6	23	266642	He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high_school and had immediately set_about learning his new trade . 
12825	br-f22	6	24	266661	There was no weapon Early could not take_apart and reassemble blind-folded . 
12826	br-f22	6	25	266673	He could lead a patrol and he knew his paper_work . 
12827	br-f22	6	26	266684	Further , he had taken full advantage of the Army 's correspondence_courses . 
12828	br-f22	6	27	266697	He not_only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as_well . 
12829	br-f22	7	28	266710	But for all his erudite confidence , Sergeant_Early was right out of the Garryowen mold . 
12830	br-f22	7	29	266726	He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting_Seventh . 
12831	br-f22	7	30	266736	That saved Mel_Chandler . 
12832	br-f22	7	31	266740	Sergeant_Early let the new CO know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United_States Army . 
12833	br-f22	7	32	266766	He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment . 
12834	br-f22	7	33	266780	For_example , it was a battalion of the 7_th_Cavalry under Colonel_George_Armstrong_Custer that had been wiped_out at the Battle_of_The_Little_Big_Horn . 
12835	br-f22	8	34	266799	It did n't take Captain_Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of Troop_H . 
12836	br-f22	8	35	266825	But what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer , non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment . 
12837	br-f22	9	36	266861	Maneuvers over , the 7_th returned to garrison duty in Tokyo , Captain_Chandler still with them . 
12838	br-f22	9	37	266878	It was the 7_th_Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial_Palace_of_the_Emperor . 
12839	br-f22	9	38	266891	But still Mel_Chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four syllable word , `` Garryowen '' . 
12840	br-f22	9	39	266913	The final proof was a small incident . 
12841	br-f22	10	40	266921	It happened at the St._Patrick 's_Day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone_into battle for over three quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march . 
12842	br-f22	10	41	266954	In_the_middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing_down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen . 
12843	br-f22	10	42	266983	The faces belonged_to Lieutenant_Marvin_Goulding , his wife and their two children . 
12844	br-f22	10	43	266995	And when the singing began , it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish songs the best . 
12845	br-f22	11	44	267014	Though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about Marvin_Goulding , the Jewish officer from Chicago , singing tearfully about the ould sod , no_one really thought it was strange . 
12846	br-f22	11	45	267044	For Marvin_Goulding , like Giovanni_Martini , the bugler boy who carried Custer 's last message , or Margarito_Lopez , the one-man Army on Leyte , was a Garryowen , through and through . 
12847	br-f22	11	46	267077	It was no coincidence that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment . 
12848	br-f22	12	47	267095	And so Mel_Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen . 
12849	br-f22	12	48	267104	He set_out to keep Troop_H the best troop in the best regiment . 
12850	br-f22	12	49	267117	One of his innovations was to see_to_it that every man - cook and clerk as_well_as rifleman - qualified with every weapon in the troop . 
12851	br-f22	12	50	267142	Even the mess sergeant , Bill_Brown , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , went_out on the range . 
12852	br-f22	13	51	267164	The troop received a new leader , Lieutenant_Robert_M._Carroll , fresh out of ROTC and bucking for Regular_Army status . 
12853	br-f22	13	52	267183	Carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that RA berth , and he wanted to play it cool . 
12854	br-f22	13	53	267209	So Mel_Chandler set_out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before . 
12855	br-f22	14	54	267233	When the Korean_war began , on June 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day Custer had gone_down fighting at the Little_Big_Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World_War_2 , , the 7_th_Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition . 
12856	br-f22	14	55	267281	Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World_War_2 , . 
12857	br-f22	15	56	267315	Just a month after the Korean_War broke_out , the 7_th_Cavalry was moving_into the lines , ready for combat . 
12858	br-f22	15	57	267334	From then on the Fighting_Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea . 
12859	br-f22	16	58	267350	One night on the Naktong_River , Mel_Chandler called_on that fabled esprit_de_corps . 
12860	br-f22	16	59	267362	The regiment was dug_in on the east_side of the river and the North_Koreans were steadily building_up a concentration of crack troops on the other side . 
12861	br-f22	16	60	267388	The troopers knew an attack was coming , but they did n't know when , and they did n't know where . 
12862	br-f22	16	61	267410	At 6_o_'_clock on the morning of August 12 , they were in doubt no_longer . 
12863	br-f22	16	62	267425	Then it came , against Troop_H . 
12864	br-f22	17	63	267432	The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with Russian machine_guns , attacked the position held by Chandler 's men . 
12865	br-f22	17	64	267464	They came in waves . 
12866	br-f22	17	65	267469	First came the cannon_fodder , white clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering_ram . 
12867	br-f22	17	66	267487	They were followed by crack North_Korean troops , who mounted one charge after another . 
12868	br-f22	17	67	267502	They overran the 7_th_Cav 's forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of_their_own dead . 
12869	br-f22	18	68	267521	Another force flanked the company and took_up a position on a hill to the rear . 
12870	br-f22	18	69	267537	Captain_Chandler saw that it was building_up strength . 
12871	br-f22	18	70	267545	He assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill . 
12872	br-f22	18	71	267578	One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant_Carroll , the young officer bucking for the Regular_Army . 
12873	br-f22	18	72	267595	Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight . 
12874	br-f22	19	73	267615	Then Mel_Chandler started up the hill . 
12875	br-f22	19	74	267622	He took one step , two , broke_into a trot and_then into a run . 
12876	br-f22	19	75	267637	The first thing he knew the words `` Garryowen '' ! burst from his throat . 
12877	br-f22	19	76	267653	His followers shouted the old battle_cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran . 
12878	br-f22	20	77	267671	The Koreans fell_back , but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire . 
12879	br-f22	20	78	267694	Chandler , looking_to right and left to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle_cry as he ran . 
12880	br-f22	20	79	267727	It was Bob_Carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen . 
12881	br-f22	20	80	267743	He had formed his own task_force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting_Seventh charge . 
12882	br-f22	20	81	267763	Because of this diversionary_attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again . 
12883	br-f22	20	82	267785	But an enemy grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously . 
12884	br-f22	20	83	267798	He went_down like a wet rag and the attackers hit_the_dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire . 
12885	br-f22	21	84	267817	Enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft_spot . 
12886	br-f22	21	85	267827	They found it at the junction between Troops_H_and_G , and prepared to counterattack . 
12887	br-f22	21	86	267841	Marvin_Goulding saw what was happening . 
12888	br-f22	21	87	267847	He turned_to his platoon . 
12889	br-f22	21	88	267852	`` Okay , men '' , he said . 
12890	br-f22	21	89	267861	`` Follow me '' . 
12891	br-f22	21	90	267866	Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward , `` Garryowen '' ! on his lips , his men following . 
12892	br-f22	21	91	267887	But the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle_cry and Marvin_Goulding fell dead . 
12893	br-f22	21	92	267902	For an instant his men hesitated , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , was dead . 
12894	br-f22	21	93	267927	Then they let_out a bellow of anguish and rage and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` Garryowen '' ! they charged into the enemy like wild_men . 
12895	br-f22	22	94	267955	That finished the job that Captain_Chandler and Lieutenant_Carroll had begun . 
12896	br-f22	22	95	267966	Goulding 's platoon pushed_back the enemy soldiers and broke_up the timing of the entire enemy attack . 
12897	br-f22	22	96	267983	Reinforcements came_up quickly to take_advantage of the opening made by Goulding 's platoon . 
12898	br-f22	22	97	267997	The North_Koreans threw_away their guns and fled across the rice_paddies . 
12899	br-f22	22	98	268008	Artillery and air strikes were called_in to kill them by the hundreds . 
12900	br-f22	23	99	268021	Though Bob_Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown_off by the exploding grenade , he lived . 
12901	br-f22	23	100	268039	Today he is a major - in the Regular_Army . 
12902	br-f22	24	101	268049	So filled was Mel_Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over , he took_on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment . 
12903	br-f22	24	102	268077	After years of digging , nights and weekends , he put_together the big , profusely illustrated book , Of_Garryowen_and_Glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military_unit . 
12904	br-f22	25	103	268108	The battle of the Naktong_River is just one example of how the battle_cry and the spirit of The Fighting_Seventh have paid_off . 
12905	br-f22	25	104	268130	For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment . 
12906	br-f22	26	105	268148	Take the case of Major_Marcus_A._Reno , who survived the Battle_of_The_Little_Big_Horn in 1876 . 
12907	br-f22	26	106	268161	From the enlisted_men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus_Reno . 
12908	br-f22	26	107	268190	Many_of his fellow officers refused to speak_to him . 
12909	br-f22	26	108	268199	But when a board of inquiry was called to look_into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him . 
12910	br-f22	26	109	268255	He was a member of The Fighting_Seventh . 
12911	br-f22	27	110	268263	Although it was at the Battle_of_The_Little_Horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history , that the 7_th_Cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then . 
12912	br-f22	27	111	268304	Brevet_Major_General_George_Armstrong_Custer was the regiment 's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George_S._Patton and Terry_de_la_Mesa_Allen in their rise to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood_and_guts warfare . 
12913	br-f22	28	112	268336	During the Civil_War , Custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier_general at the age of 23 . 
12914	br-f22	29	113	268357	He finished the war as a major_general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major_general in the history of the U._S. Army . 
12915	br-f23	1	1	268385	I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them . 
12916	br-f23	1	2	268406	If they were , Walter_Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George_Sokolsky , and Herblock would have nothing to draw cartoons about . 
12917	br-f23	1	3	268430	I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions . 
12918	br-f23	2	4	268459	The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ; and in_particular - since this is our special responsibility - that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United_States . 
12919	br-f23	2	5	268511	I speak_of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved - ever - reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human_beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around . 
12920	br-f23	3	6	268558	These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism . 
12921	br-f23	3	7	268583	This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization . 
12922	br-f23	3	8	268627	Moreover , as Communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro_rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote . 
12923	br-f23	4	9	268654	It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant , proximate goal of American policy . 
12924	br-f23	4	10	268670	Proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive '' ends we seek , to which victory over Communism is but a means . 
12925	br-f23	4	11	268698	But dominant in the sense that every other objective , no_matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it . 
12926	br-f23	4	12	268718	Peace is a worthy objective ; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin , then we must fight . 
12927	br-f23	4	13	268744	Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed . 
12928	br-f23	4	14	268781	Justice is a worthy objective ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union_of_South_Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer . 
12929	br-f23	4	15	268820	Prosperity is a worthy objective ; but if providing higher standards_of_living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made . 
12930	br-f23	4	16	268855	It may be , of_course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in_favor_of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of Soviet Communist power . 
12931	br-f23	5	17	268905	This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources ought to be used . 
12932	br-f23	5	18	268943	This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power . 
12933	br-f23	5	19	268962	I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . 
12934	br-f23	5	20	268986	And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free_world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . 
12935	br-f23	6	21	269026	In the recent political_campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus . 
12936	br-f23	6	22	269055	One was demonstrably false ; the other , for_the_most_part , true . 
12937	br-f23	7	23	269067	The first was that America had become - or was in_danger_of becoming - a second-rate military power . 
12938	br-f23	7	24	269085	I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention . 
12939	br-f23	7	25	269101	You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment - I certainly do - but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United_States not_only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U._S. - Soviet relations for the foreseeable future . 
12940	br-f23	8	26	269169	I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr._Jameson_Campaigne has done it well in his new book American_Might_and_Soviet_Myth . 
12941	br-f23	8	27	269202	Suppose , he says , that the tables_were_turned , and we were in the Soviets ' position : `` There would be more_than 2000 modern Soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean . 
12942	br-f23	8	28	269245	Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a_few hundred miles of our coast . 
12943	br-f23	8	29	269260	Half of the population of the U._S. would be needed to work_on arms just to feed the people '' . 
12944	br-f23	8	30	269280	Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn_on us at the first opportunity . 
12945	br-f23	8	31	269304	Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep_abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength . 
12946	br-f23	9	32	269336	If we look_at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev 's nightmarish worries - or , at_least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage . 
12947	br-f23	10	33	269375	The other charge was that America 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years . 
12948	br-f23	10	34	269394	The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world_affairs can quarrel with it . 
12949	br-f23	11	35	269434	The argument was typically advanced in_terms_of U._S. `` prestige '' . 
12950	br-f23	11	36	269445	Prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading . 
12951	br-f23	11	37	269472	Prestige is a measure of how other people think_of you , well or ill . 
12952	br-f23	11	38	269487	But contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake . 
12953	br-f23	11	39	269507	Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be . 
12954	br-f23	11	40	269535	The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it . 
12955	br-f23	12	41	269562	The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United_States is weaker than the Soviet_Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead . 
12956	br-f23	12	42	269590	This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human_beings typically do - namely , by taking steps to end_up on what appears to be the winning side . 
12957	br-f23	12	43	269636	To the extent , then , that declining U._S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern . 
12958	br-f23	13	44	269679	Still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet_Union and ourselves . 
12959	br-f23	13	45	269704	Here I do not speak_of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power - of influence , if you will - about which the relevant questions are : 
12960	br-f23	13	46	269737	Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ? 
12961	br-f23	13	47	269753	And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be ? 
12962	br-f23	14	48	269766	In answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded : 
12963	br-f23	14	49	269812	the success of Communism 's war against the West does not depend_on such spectacular and definitive conquests . 
12964	br-f23	14	50	269830	Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence . 
12965	br-f23	15	51	269840	Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages . 
12966	br-f23	15	52	269856	Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United_Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences - preferably at the highest level . 
12967	br-f23	16	53	269929	The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first_step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West . 
12968	br-f23	16	54	269952	Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . 
12969	br-f23	16	55	269971	The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in_fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy . 
12970	br-f23	16	56	270000	And this may be as far as the process will go . 
12971	br-f23	16	57	270012	The Kremlin 's goal is the isolation and capture , not of Ghana , but of the United_States - and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist '' mask , yet in_fact are dependable auxiliaries of the Soviet Foreign_Office . 
12972	br-f23	17	58	270060	To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring . 
12973	br-f23	18	59	270072	Six years ago French_Indochina , though in troubie , was in the Western camp . 
12974	br-f23	18	60	270087	Today Northern_Vietnam is overtly Communist ; Laos is teetering between Communism and pro Communist neutralism ; Cambodia is , for_all_practical_purposes , neutralist . 
12975	br-f23	19	61	270110	Indonesia , in the early_days of the Republic , leaned toward the West . 
12976	br-f23	19	62	270124	Today Sukarno 's government is heavily besieged by avowed Communists , and for all_of its `` neutralist '' pretensions , it is a firm ally of Soviet policy . 
12977	br-f23	20	63	270153	Ceylon has moved from a pro Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West . 
12978	br-f23	21	64	270170	In the Middle_East , Iraq , Syria and Egypt were , a short while ago , in the Western camp . 
12979	br-f23	21	65	270191	Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West , are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel ; in almost every particular follow the Kremlin 's foreign_policy line . 
12980	br-f23	22	66	270227	A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve . 
12981	br-f23	22	67	270238	Never_mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land_mass was under the domination and influence of the West . 
12982	br-f23	22	68	270272	Today , Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging , it would seem , into the Soviet orbit . 
12983	br-f23	23	69	270294	Latin_America was once an area as `` safe '' for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon . 
12984	br-f23	23	70	270312	Today it is up_for_grabs . 
12985	br-f23	23	71	270317	One Latin_American country , Cuba , has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast . 
12986	br-f23	23	72	270334	In some countries the trend has gone further than others : 
12987	br-f23	23	73	270345	Mexico , Panama , and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism , and there is no country - save the Dominican_Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged - where Castroism and anti Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause . 
12988	br-f23	24	74	270391	Only in Europe have our lines remained_firm - and there only on the surface . 
12989	br-f23	24	75	270406	The strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in England , and even in Germany . 
12990	br-f23	25	76	270423	What have we to show by_way_of counter successes ? 
12991	br-f23	25	77	270432	We have had opportunities - clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron_Curtain . 
12992	br-f23	25	78	270451	There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about . 
12993	br-f23	25	79	270467	There was the Polish Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to Soviet interests . 
12994	br-f23	25	80	270487	There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended did not exist . 
12995	br-f23	25	81	270500	Only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power : 
12996	br-f23	25	82	270516	in Guatemala . 
12997	br-f23	25	83	270519	And contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures '' and `` world opinion '' to bring_down that Communist government ; we moved decisively to effect an anti Communist coup_d_'_etat . 
12998	br-f23	25	84	270558	We served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery . 
12999	br-f24	1	1	270579	The first rattle of the machine_guns , at 7 : 10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear . 
13000	br-f24	2	2	270605	`` Sounds exactly like last time '' . 
13001	br-f24	2	3	270613	The young_man spoke steadily enough , but all_at_once he looked grotesquely unshaven . 
13002	br-f24	2	4	270626	The middle-aged man said over_and_over , `` Why did I come here , why did I come here '' . 
13003	br-f24	2	5	270646	Then he was sick . 
13004	br-f24	2	6	270651	Amid the crackle of small_arms and automatic weapons , I heard the thumping of mortars . 
13005	br-f24	2	7	270667	Then the lights went_out . 
13006	br-f24	3	8	270672	This was my second day in Vientiane , the administrative capital of Laos , and my thoughts were none too brave . 
13007	br-f24	3	9	270694	Where was my flashlight ? 
13008	br-f24	3	10	270699	Where should I go ? 
13009	br-f24	3	11	270704	To my room ? 
13010	br-f24	3	12	270708	Better stay in the hotel lobby , where the walls looked good and thick . 
13011	br-f24	4	13	270723	Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters . 
13012	br-f24	4	14	270736	Hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby . 
13013	br-f24	4	15	270745	A woman with a small boy slipped in between them . 
13014	br-f24	4	16	270756	`` Please '' , she said , `` please '' . 
13015	br-f24	4	17	270767	She held_out her hand to show that she had money . 
13016	br-f24	5	18	270778	The American newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office . 
13017	br-f24	5	19	270789	But what was the story ? 
13018	br-f24	5	20	270795	Had the Communist led Pathet_Lao finally come this far ? 
13019	br-f24	5	21	270805	Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane ? 
13020	br-f24	6	22	270813	`` Let 's play hero '' , I said . 
13021	br-f24	6	23	270823	`` Let 's go to the roof and see '' . 
13022	br-f24	7	24	270834	By 7 : 50 the answer was plain . 
13023	br-f24	7	25	270843	There had been an eclipse of the moon . 
13024	br-f24	7	26	270852	A traditional Lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad , and the remedy was to make all possible noise , ideally with firearms . 
13025	br-f24	8	27	270881	The din was successful , too , for just before the moon disappeared , the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again , which meant good_luck all around . 
13026	br-f24	9	28	270912	How quaint it all seemed the next day . 
13027	br-f24	9	29	270921	A restaurant posted a reminder to patrons `` who became excited and left without paying their checks '' . 
13028	br-f24	9	30	270940	But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later . 
13029	br-f24	9	31	270953	And no wonder , for Vientiane , the old City of Sandalwood , had become the City of Bullet_Holes . 
13030	br-f24	10	32	270973	I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets . 
13031	br-f24	10	33	270988	Along the main thoroughfares hardly_a house had not been peppered . 
13032	br-f24	10	34	270999	In place of the police_headquarters was a new square filled with rubble . 
13033	br-f24	10	35	271012	Mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next_door . 
13034	br-f24	10	36	271027	What had been the ambassador 's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick . 
13035	br-f24	11	37	271042	This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane , fought less_than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9 - 11 , 1960 ) . 
13036	br-f24	11	38	271077	And now , in March , all Laos suffered a state of siege . 
13037	br-f24	11	39	271091	The Pathet_Lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more . 
13038	br-f24	11	40	271107	Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death . 
13039	br-f24	12	41	271120	`` And it 's all the more tragic because it 's so little deserved '' , said Mr._J._J._A._Frans , a Belgian official of the United_Nations Educational_,_Scientific_,_and_Cultural_Organization . 
13040	br-f24	12	42	271147	We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with the U._N. flag . 
13041	br-f24	13	43	271160	Practically all the people of Laos , he explained - about two million of them - are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows . 
13042	br-f24	13	44	271199	They look_after their fields and children and water_buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls . 
13043	br-f24	13	45	271221	Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are . 
13044	br-f24	13	46	271232	They spread over an area no larger than Oregon ; yet they include peoples as different from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians . 
13045	br-f24	14	47	271257	`` What matters here is family loyalty ; faith in the_Buddha and staying at peace with the phis , the spirits ; and to live in harmony with nature '' . 
13046	br-f24	15	48	271288	Harmony in Laos ? 
13047	br-f24	15	49	271292	`` Precisely '' , said Mr._Frans . 
13048	br-f24	15	50	271299	He spoke_of the season of dryness and dust , brought by the monsoon from the northeast , in_harmony with the season of rain and mud , brought by the monsoon from the southwest . 
13049	br-f24	15	51	271333	The slim pirogues in_harmony with the majestically meandering Mekong_River . 
13050	br-f24	15	52	271343	Shy , slender-waisted girls at the loom in_harmony with the frangipani by the wayside . 
13051	br-f24	15	53	271358	Even life in_harmony with death . 
13052	br-f24	15	54	271364	For so_long_as death was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral a feast . 
13053	br-f24	16	55	271385	To many_a Frenchman - they came 95 years ago , colonized , and stayed until Laos became independent in 1953 - the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti . 
13054	br-f24	16	56	271417	Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe . 
13055	br-f24	16	57	271433	The Pathet_Lao , stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring North Viet_Nam , were supplied by Soviet aircraft . 
13056	br-f24	16	58	271451	The Royal_Lao_Army , on_the other hand , was paid and equipped with American funds . 
13057	br-f24	16	59	271466	In six years , U._S. aid had amounted to more_than $ 1.60 for each American - a total of three hundred million dollars . 
13058	br-f24	17	60	271490	We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world 's giants . 
13059	br-f24	17	61	271512	Even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine_guns ? 
13060	br-f24	18	62	271536	To find_out , we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at_least , by the Royal_Lao_Army : from Attopeu , the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast , to Muong_Sing , the City of Lions in the northwest , close to Communist_China ( map , page 250 ) . 
13061	br-f24	18	63	271592	We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly . 
13062	br-f24	18	64	271616	We flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they did n't crash . 
13063	br-f24	18	65	271632	In_the_end we ran_into Communist artillery_fire . 
13064	br-f24	19	66	271638	`` We '' were Bill_Garrett of the National_Geographic Illustrations_Staff , whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met ; Boun_My , our interpreter ; and myself . 
13065	br-f24	20	67	271674	Boun_My - the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky - was born in Savannakhet , the Border of Paradise . 
13066	br-f24	20	68	271703	He had attended three universities in the United_States . 
13067	br-f24	20	69	271712	But he had never seen the mountainous half of his native_land north of Vientiane , including the royal capital , Luang_Prabang . 
13068	br-f24	20	70	271734	Before the airplanes came , he said , travel in Laos was just_about impossible . 
13069	br-f24	21	71	271749	Alas , so it almost proved for us , too . 
13070	br-f24	21	72	271760	To go outside the few cities required permits . 
13071	br-f24	21	73	271769	and getting them seemed a life 's work . 
13072	br-f24	21	74	271778	Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers could be spared as escorts . 
13073	br-f24	22	75	271796	We were told that to the Pathet_Lao , a kidnaped American was worth at_least $ 750 , a fortune in Laos . 
13074	br-f24	22	76	271818	Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had spurned an escort . 
13075	br-f24	22	77	271831	Now Pathet_Lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil American intervention . 
13076	br-f24	23	78	271851	Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government_offices in Vientiane , with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in French , we were getting nowhere . 
13077	br-f24	23	79	271877	We had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the Prime_Minister . 
13078	br-f24	23	80	271904	Could we be ready in 15_minutes ? 
13079	br-f24	23	81	271911	His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go_out of town , and he was eager to be off . 
13080	br-f24	24	82	271932	And so , after a flight southeast to Savannakhet , we found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince_Boun_Oum of Champassak , a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush_jacket and a ten-gallon_hat from Texas . 
13081	br-f24	24	83	271974	From his shoulder_bag peeked the seven inch barrel of a Luger . 
13082	br-f24	25	84	271986	The temperature rose to 105 ` . 
13083	br-f24	25	85	271993	With our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust . 
13084	br-f24	26	86	272008	In Keng_Kok , the City of Silkworms , the Prime_Minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me . 
13085	br-f24	26	87	272031	Then we drove on , until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields , bouncing across their squat earth walls . 
13086	br-f24	27	88	272056	It was a spleen crushing day . 
13087	br-f24	27	89	272063	An hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary . 
13088	br-f24	27	90	272082	More bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well . 
13089	br-f24	27	91	272098	Then off again , rushing to keep_up . 
13090	br-f24	27	92	272106	We were miserable . 
13091	br-f24	28	93	272110	But our two Jeep mates - Keo_Viphakone from Luang_Prabang and John_Cool from Beaver , Pennsylvania - were beaming under their coatings of dust . 
13092	br-f24	28	94	272134	Together they had probably done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20 th century - constructively . 
13093	br-f24	28	95	272156	Mr._Keo , once a diplomat in Paris and Washington , was Commissioner_of_Rural_Affairs . 
13094	br-f24	28	96	272169	John , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the London_School_of_Economics , headed the rural development division of USOM , the United_States_Operations_Mission administering U._S. aid . 
13095	br-f24	29	97	272196	`` What you see are self-help projects '' , John said . 
13096	br-f24	29	98	272208	`` We ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor . 
13097	br-f24	29	99	272223	We send shovels , cement , nails , and corrugated_iron for roofs . 
13098	br-f24	29	100	272236	That way they have an infirmary for $ 400 . 
13099	br-f24	29	101	272246	We have 2500 such projects , and they add_up to a_lot more_than just roads and wells and schools . 
13100	br-f24	29	102	272265	Ask Mr._Keo '' . 
13101	br-f24	30	103	272269	Mr._Keo agreed . 
13102	br-f24	30	104	272272	`` Our people have been used_to accepting things as they found them '' , he said . 
13103	br-f24	30	105	272289	`` Where there was no road , they lived without one . 
13104	br-f24	30	106	272301	Now they learn that men can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elders , without violence . 
13105	br-f24	30	107	272320	That 's a big step toward a modern state . 
13106	br-f24	30	108	272330	You might say we are in the nation building business '' . 
13107	br-f24	31	109	272342	In the villages people lined_up to give us flowers . 
13108	br-f24	31	110	272352	Then came coconuts , eggs , and rice wine . 
13109	br-f24	31	111	272362	The Prime_Minister paid his respects to the Buddhist monks , strode rapidly among the houses , joked with the local soldiery , and made a speech . 
13110	br-f24	31	112	272389	The soldiers are fighting and the Americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the Pathet_Lao the key factor is the villager himself . 
13111	br-f24	32	113	272417	Then we were off again . 
13112	br-f24	32	114	272423	We did it for three days . 
13113	br-f24	33	115	272430	But our stumping tour of the south was n't all misery . 
13114	br-f24	33	116	272442	Crossing the 4000 - foot width of the Mekong at Champassak , on a raft with an outboard_motor , we took_off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze . 
13115	br-f24	33	117	272473	Then we hung overboard in the water . 
13116	br-f24	34	118	272481	Briefly we rolled over a paved road up_to Pak_Song , on the cool Bolovens_Plateau . 
13117	br-f24	34	119	272496	The Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood , supported by the Junior_Chamber_of_Commerce of the Philippines , and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak_Song . 
13118	br-f24	35	120	272528	In the village of Soukhouma , which means `` Peaceful '' , we had a baci . 
13119	br-f24	35	121	272545	This is the most endearing of Lao ceremonies . 
13120	br-f24	35	122	272554	It takes_place in the household , a rite of well_wishing for myriad occasions - for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the New Year , for any good purpose . 
13121	br-f24	36	123	272591	The preparations were elaborate : flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string . 
13122	br-f24	36	124	272617	The strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ) . 
13123	br-f24	37	125	272632	The candles were lighted , and we sat on split bamboo mats among the village notables . 
13124	br-f24	37	126	272649	I was careful to keep my feet , the seat of the least worthy spirits , from pointing at anyone 's head , where the worthiest spirits reside . 
13125	br-f24	37	127	272678	Now a distinguished old_man called_on nine divinities to come and join us . 
13126	br-f24	38	128	272691	Next he addressed himself to our souls . 
13127	br-f24	38	129	272699	A man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body . 
13128	br-f24	38	130	272713	Those souls like to wander off , and must be called back . 
13129	br-f24	39	131	272726	With the divinities present and our souls in_place , we were wished health , happiness , and power . 
13130	br-f24	39	132	272745	Then , one_after_another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists . 
13131	br-f24	39	133	272760	These were to be kept on , to hold_in the 32 souls . 
13132	br-f24	40	134	272773	As we stepped_out into the sunlight , a man came_up_to John_Cool and silently showed him his hand . 
13133	br-f24	40	135	272791	It had a festering hole as big as a silver_dollar . 
13134	br-f24	40	136	272802	We could see maggots moving . 
13135	br-f24	41	137	272808	John said : `` I have some antiseptic salve with me , but it 's too late for that '' . 
13136	br-f25	1	1	272829	My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds . 
13137	br-f25	1	2	272845	Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings . 
13138	br-f25	1	3	272856	`` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked . 
13139	br-f25	1	4	272869	`` It means that you have_to get_ahead '' . 
13140	br-f25	1	5	272878	When I pressed for a purely religious definition , I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good_will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty . 
13141	br-f25	2	6	272907	`` I like the tradition '' , a girl said . 
13142	br-f25	2	7	272918	`` I like to follow the holidays when they come_along . 
13143	br-f25	2	8	272929	But you do n't have_to worship in the traditional way . 
13144	br-f25	2	9	272940	You can communicate in your own way . 
13145	br-f25	2	10	272948	As I see it , there 's no real difference between being Jewish , Catholic , or Protestant '' . 
13146	br-f25	3	11	272968	Another teen-ager remarked : `` Most Jews do n't believe_in God , but they believe_in people - in helping people '' . 
13147	br-f25	3	12	272990	Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; it 's to be a good_person '' . 
13148	br-f25	3	13	273015	When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It 's the same thing '' . 
13149	br-f25	4	14	273039	This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad . 
13150	br-f25	4	15	273049	They discovered that , although 42 per_cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per_cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per_cent of the Jewish students had this conviction . 
13151	br-f25	4	16	273093	The most important aims of the Jewish students were as_follows : to make the world a better place to live in - 30 per_cent ; to get happiness for yourself - 28 per_cent ; and financial independence - 21 per_cent . 
13152	br-f25	5	17	273134	Nevertheless , most_of the teen-agers I interviewed believed_in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple . 
13153	br-f25	5	18	273155	However , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy , professing to believe_in Judaism `` but in a moderate way '' . 
13154	br-f25	5	19	273176	One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews : `` It 's the twentieth century , and they do n't have_to wear beards '' . 
13155	br-f25	6	20	273200	The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers ' minds . 
13156	br-f25	6	21	273220	`` We were brought_up that way '' was one statement which won general assent . 
13157	br-f25	6	22	273235	`` I want to show respect for my parents ' religion '' was the way in_which a boy justified his inhabiting_a_halfway_house of Judaism . 
13158	br-f25	6	23	273259	Still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since I 'll be living in a suburb '' . 
13159	br-f25	7	24	273283	Intermarriage , which is generally regarded_as a threat to Jewish survival , was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval . 
13160	br-f25	7	25	273312	Most_of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds . 
13161	br-f25	7	26	273323	`` When you marry , you want to have things in common '' , a girl said , `` and it 's hard when you do n't marry someone with your own background '' . 
13162	br-f25	8	27	273358	A fourteen year old girl from the Middle_West observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities - at_least with the peripheral activities that many middle_class Jews now regard_as religious . 
13163	br-f25	8	28	273394	It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and , in_addition , required kosher food . 
13164	br-f25	8	29	273431	Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only Orthodox girl in town '' . 
13165	br-f25	8	30	273451	This is , no_doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant . 
13166	br-f25	9	31	273474	One of the significant things about Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college oriented . 
13167	br-f25	9	32	273495	Sixty_five per_cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning . 
13168	br-f25	9	33	273510	This is substantially higher than the figures for the American population at_large - 45.6 per_cent for males and 29.2 per_cent for females . 
13169	br-f25	9	34	273533	This may help explain a phenomenon described by a small_town Jewish boy . 
13170	br-f25	9	35	273546	In their first two years in high_school , Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams . 
13171	br-f25	9	36	273570	However , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement . 
13172	br-f25	9	37	273595	It is significant , too , that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts . 
13173	br-f25	10	38	273627	The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys . 
13174	br-f25	10	39	273644	The motivations for both sexes , to_be_sure , are different . 
13175	br-f25	10	40	273655	The vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while Jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed . 
13176	br-f25	10	41	273679	One of the significant developments in American Jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women . 
13177	br-f25	10	42	273698	It is they who read - and make - Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them . 
13178	br-f25	11	43	273718	In upper teen Jewish life , the non college group tends to have a sense of marginality . 
13179	br-f25	11	44	273736	`` People automatically assume that I 'm in college '' , a nineteen year old machinist observed irritably . 
13180	br-f25	11	45	273755	However , among the girls , there are some morale enhancing compensations for not going_to college . 
13181	br-f25	11	46	273772	The Jewish working_girl almost invariably works in an office - in contradistinction to gentile factory_workers - and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college_student . 
13182	br-f25	11	47	273810	She is even prone to regard the college_girl as immature . 
13183	br-f25	12	48	273821	One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost . 
13184	br-f25	12	49	273851	This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New_York , Chicago , and Philadelphia . 
13185	br-f25	13	50	273869	What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self_enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non Jewish world . 
13186	br-f25	14	51	273913	Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn_College - constituting 85 per_cent of those who attend the day session - can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower_middle_class Jewish student . 
13187	br-f25	15	52	273944	There is , to begin , an important sex difference . 
13188	br-f25	15	53	273955	Typically , in a lower-middle_class Jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college . 
13189	br-f25	15	54	273988	There are two reasons for this . 
13190	br-f25	15	55	273995	First , the girl 's education has a lower priority than the son 's . 
13191	br-f25	15	56	274010	Second , the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son . 
13192	br-f25	15	57	274029	Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home . 
13193	br-f25	15	58	274051	The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn_College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically . 
13194	br-f25	15	59	274070	One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town . 
13195	br-f25	16	60	274084	Brooklyn_College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school . 
13196	br-f25	16	61	274094	On_the_one_hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high_school . 
13197	br-f25	16	62	274111	This is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood_High_School directly across the street from Brooklyn_College . 
13198	br-f25	16	63	274127	They have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school . 
13199	br-f25	16	64	274146	At_the_same_time , there is a good_deal of self congratulation at attending a good college - they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues - and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates . 
13200	br-f25	16	65	274186	`` It 's people of your own kind '' , a girl remarked . 
13201	br-f25	16	66	274200	`` You do n't have_to watch what you say . 
13202	br-f25	16	67	274210	Of_course , I would like to go_to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but I would want lots of Jewish kids there '' . 
13203	br-f25	17	68	274239	For most Brooklyn_College students , college is at_once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking_away from the cage of neighborhood and family . 
13204	br-f25	17	69	274264	Brooklyn_College is unequivocally Jewish in tone , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing_in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing . 
13205	br-f25	17	70	274289	However , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents . 
13206	br-f25	17	71	274319	And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view_as softly and insidiously enveloping . 
13207	br-f25	17	72	274351	`` As_long_as I 'm home , I 'll never grow_up '' , a nineteen year old boy observed sadly . 
13208	br-f25	17	73	274371	`` They do n't like it if I do anything away from home . 
13209	br-f25	17	74	274385	It 's so much trouble , I do n't usually bother '' . 
13210	br-f25	18	75	274398	For girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive . 
13211	br-f25	18	76	274408	Parents will drive on Friday night to pick_up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting . 
13212	br-f25	18	77	274426	A freshman girl 's father not too long_ago called a dean at Brooklyn_College and demanded the `` low-down '' on a boy who was going_out with his daughter . 
13213	br-f25	18	78	274455	The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field . 
13214	br-f25	18	79	274468	Under pressure from parents , the majority of Brooklyn_College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans - limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours . 
13215	br-f25	18	80	274498	This means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature . 
13216	br-f25	18	81	274519	A kind of double_standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex . 
13217	br-f25	19	82	274539	The breaking_away from the prison_house of Brooklyn is gradual . 
13218	br-f25	19	83	274549	First , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights . 
13219	br-f25	19	84	274570	Then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying_forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of New_York . 
13220	br-f25	19	85	274594	It is significant that the Catskills , which used_to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of New_York , no_longer attracts them in great numbers - except for those who work there as waiters , bus_boys , or counselors in the day_camps . 
13221	br-f25	19	86	274643	The great world beyond beckons . 
13222	br-f25	19	87	274649	But it should be pointed_out that some of the new watering_places - Fire_Island , Nantucket , Westhampton , Long_Island , for_example - tend to be homogeneously Jewish . 
13223	br-f25	19	88	274677	Although Brooklyn_College does not_yet have a junior year abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in Europe . 
13224	br-f25	19	89	274698	In_general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith . 
13225	br-f25	19	90	274718	And acculturation into the world at_large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn_College student after college rather_than during the four school_years . 
13226	br-f25	20	91	274740	Brooklyn_College is Marjorie_Morningstar territory , as much_as the_Bronx or Central_Park_West . 
13227	br-f25	20	92	274751	There are hordes of nubile young_women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry . 
13228	br-f25	20	93	274771	It is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere - about 30 per_cent of the women and 25 per_cent of the men in the graduating_class - the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed_up the estimate . 
13229	br-f25	20	94	274817	`` Almost everybody in the senior_class is married '' , students say dogmatically . 
13230	br-f25	20	95	274831	And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the House_Plan_Association ) that have good news to impart . 
13231	br-f25	20	96	274857	These announcements are , in_effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage_marts . 
13232	br-f25	20	97	274870	There are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity . 
13233	br-f25	20	98	274896	`` Witt_House happily announces the engagement of Fran_Horowitz to Erwin_Schwartz of Fife_House '' . 
13234	br-f25	21	99	274910	The Brooklyn_College student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models . 
13235	br-f25	21	100	274922	The Ivy_League enjoys no easy dominion here , and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion , or even in nondescript working_class manner , as they are in the restrained , button-down Ivy way . 
13236	br-f25	21	101	274962	The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town , and eye_shadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdos - despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel - are not unknown even in early morning classes . 
13237	br-f25	22	102	275005	Among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking . 
13238	br-f25	22	103	275017	Brooklyn_College is distinctive for not having an official drinking place . 
13239	br-f25	22	104	275028	The Fort_Lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn_College boys . 
13240	br-f33	1	1	275040	In a_few school districts one finds a link between school and job . 
13241	br-f33	1	2	275053	In those vocational_programs organized with Smith-Hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor_union and a local employer on_the_one_hand and the vocational teacher on the other . 
13242	br-f33	1	3	275083	In these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 . 
13243	br-f33	1	4	275110	The apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high_school . 
13244	br-f33	1	5	275137	These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto_mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical_work , tool-and-die_work , and sheet-metal work . 
13245	br-f33	2	6	275164	Formally organized vocational_programs supported by federal funds allow high_school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation . 
13246	br-f33	2	7	275194	The `` diversified occupations '' program is a part-time trade preparatory program conducted over two school_years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers . 
13247	br-f33	2	8	275224	The `` distributive education '' program operates in_a_similar_way , with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields . 
13248	br-f33	2	9	275244	In both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half . 
13249	br-f33	2	10	275262	He receives remuneration for his work . 
13250	br-f33	2	11	275269	In a_few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation . 
13251	br-f33	3	12	275306	Adult_education courses , work-study_programs of various sorts - these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth . 
13252	br-f33	3	13	275333	In_general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high_school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next . 
13253	br-f33	3	14	275368	If the student drops_out of high_school , the break with the school is even more complete . 
13254	br-f33	3	15	275385	When there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement - or lack of arrangement - works_out quite well . 
13255	br-f33	3	16	275405	Indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work . 
13256	br-f33	3	17	275448	Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one . 
13257	br-f33	3	18	275478	I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high_school and was highly successful in the business which he entered . 
13258	br-f33	3	19	275512	He may or may_not be `` better_off '' than his classmate who went_on to a college and professional school . 
13259	br-f33	3	20	275532	But in the next decades the nation needs_to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent . 
13260	br-f33	4	21	275550	In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high_school where he is found . 
13261	br-f33	4	22	275585	In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation . 
13262	br-f33	4	23	275608	High motivation towards higher_education must start early enough so_that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at_least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work . 
13263	br-f33	4	24	275643	Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools . 
13264	br-f33	4	25	275661	However , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual . 
13265	br-f33	4	26	275682	And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership . 
13266	br-f33	4	27	275701	This is not due_to any policy of discrimination on_the_part_of the Northern universities . 
13267	br-f33	4	28	275714	Quite the contrary , as I can testify from personal experience as a former university president . 
13268	br-f33	4	29	275731	Rather we see here another vicious_circle . 
13269	br-f33	4	30	275738	The absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp_down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers . 
13270	br-f33	4	31	275762	I believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need_to be heavily publicized . 
13271	br-f33	4	32	275778	Here again we run_into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated as Negroes in the press . 
13272	br-f33	4	33	275798	How can the vicious_circle be broken ? 
13273	br-f33	4	34	275805	This is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both Negro and white , should devote far more attention . 
13274	br-f33	4	35	275826	It is at_least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break_down barriers of inequality in the South . 
13275	br-f33	5	36	275845	I should_like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect_to vocational education . 
13276	br-f33	5	37	275862	First_and_foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic_program for graduation . 
13277	br-f33	5	38	275881	Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the student 's time in those years ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought_to begin earlier . 
13278	br-f33	5	39	275920	Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried_over to the academic courses which they are studying at_the_same_time . 
13279	br-f33	5	40	275970	Fourth , the type of vocational training_programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality . 
13280	br-f33	5	41	275989	This last point is important because if high_school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational_program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears . 
13281	br-f33	5	42	276031	Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in_fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter . 
13282	br-f33	5	43	276066	Those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather_than specific skills ought_to bear_in_mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience . 
13283	br-f33	6	44	276107	I have been using the word `` vocational '' as a layman would at_first_sight think it should be used . 
13284	br-f33	6	45	276127	I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls . 
13285	br-f33	6	46	276144	These courses develop skills other_than those we think_of when we use the adjective `` academic '' . 
13286	br-f33	6	47	276161	Practically all_of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high_school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at_once on the basis of the skill . 
13287	br-f33	6	48	276198	They are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high_school . 
13288	br-f33	6	49	276211	To_be_sure , in tool-and-die_work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of halftime vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status . 
13289	br-f33	6	50	276252	Similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at_once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community_college or secretarial_school . 
13290	br-f33	6	51	276302	Of_course , it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill . 
13291	br-f33	6	52	276326	So , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics . 
13292	br-f33	6	53	276344	In_a_sense almost all high_school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called_upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained . 
13293	br-f33	6	54	276390	In_spite_of the shading of one type of course into another , I believe it is useful to talk_about vocational courses as apart from academic courses . 
13294	br-f33	6	55	276416	Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded_as the exception which proves the rule . 
13295	br-f33	6	56	276431	Today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school . 
13296	br-f33	7	57	276474	Most_of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high_schools . 
13297	br-f33	7	58	276488	In this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts . 
13298	br-f33	7	59	276510	The neighborhood high_schools are not , strictly_speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high_school instead of the local school . 
13299	br-f33	7	60	276542	Indeed , one school_superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high_school for the senior_high_schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational_programs . 
13300	br-f33	7	61	276575	He prefers to designate such schools as `` general '' high_schools . 
13301	br-f33	7	62	276587	The suburban high_school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high_school because of the absence of vocational_programs . 
13302	br-f33	7	63	276610	The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community . 
13303	br-f33	7	64	276627	Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high_school described in my first report . 
13304	br-f33	8	65	276659	The separate vocational or technical high_schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions . 
13305	br-f33	8	66	276676	By_and_large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system . 
13306	br-f33	8	67	276696	It is not often realized to_what_degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few . 
13307	br-f33	8	68	276719	One has_to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high_schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` I want to be a plumber '' , and then , by doing good work , find a job . 
13308	br-f33	8	69	276761	It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get_into the most selective medical_school in the nation . 
13309	br-f33	8	70	276791	Two stories will illustrate what I have_in_mind . 
13310	br-f33	8	71	276799	One vocational instructor in a city vocational_school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city . 
13311	br-f33	8	72	276831	In the city , he said , the waiting_list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside_track he can n't get_in . 
13312	br-f33	8	73	276863	In a far distant part of the United_States , I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work . 
13313	br-f33	8	74	276891	`` What does he have_in_mind to do when he graduates '' ? 
13314	br-f33	8	75	276903	`` Oh , he 'll be a plumber '' , came the answer . 
13315	br-f33	8	76	276917	`` But is n't it almost impossible to get_into the union '' ? 
13316	br-f33	8	77	276930	I asked . 
13317	br-f33	8	78	276933	`` He 'll have no difficulty '' , I was told . 
13318	br-f33	8	79	276945	`` He has very good connections '' . 
13319	br-f33	9	80	276953	In my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational_programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city . 
13320	br-f33	9	81	276978	Ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest . 
13321	br-f33	10	82	277004	An excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high_school is the Dunbar_Vocational_High_School in Chicago . 
13322	br-f33	10	83	277022	Located in a bad slum_area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students . 
13323	br-f33	10	84	277047	Hardly_a window has been broken since Dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum_areas ) . 
13324	br-f33	10	85	277071	I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes . 
13325	br-f33	10	86	277088	They were learning trades as diverse as shoe_repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto_mechanics , and airplane_mechanics . 
13326	br-f33	10	87	277109	The physical facilities at Dunbar are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils . 
13327	br-f44	1	1	277127	In_general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis ; congregational membership , however , is another thing . 
13328	br-f44	1	2	277150	A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; that_is , when it can preserve economic integration . 
13329	br-f44	1	3	277172	Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining ; the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition . 
13330	br-f44	2	4	277225	The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner_city areas and the spread of inner_city blight account_for the decline of central_city churches . 
13331	br-f44	2	5	277246	Central_cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations : 
13332	br-f44	2	6	277256	( 1 ) central_cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social_classes ; ( 2 ) central_cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition . 
13333	br-f44	2	7	277283	The central_city areas , in_other_words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life_principle of congregations of the major denominations : they have too few middle-class people ; they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents . 
13334	br-f44	2	8	277319	Central_city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central_cities . 
13335	br-f44	2	9	277340	With few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central_city . 
13336	br-f44	3	10	277356	The key to Protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation . 
13337	br-f44	3	11	277374	Members of higher and lower social_status often cluster around this nucleus , so_that Protestant figures on social_class give the impression of spread over all social_classes ; but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum . 
13338	br-f44	3	12	277420	The congregation perishes when it is no_longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have_to recruit constantly in their core stratum in_order to survive ; they can lose higher - and lower status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in_order to preserve economic integration . 
13339	br-f44	3	13	277489	The congregation is first_and_foremost an economic peer_group ; it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship . 
13340	br-f44	3	14	277506	If it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the New Protestantism ( with a_few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do . 
13341	br-f44	3	15	277546	They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers . 
13342	br-f44	4	16	277558	The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit '' of Protestant religious life ; in_fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal '' Roman_Catholic parish . 
13343	br-f44	4	17	277599	We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection . 
13344	br-f44	4	18	277655	The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . 
13345	br-f44	4	19	277701	This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . 
13346	br-f44	5	20	277712	The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . 
13347	br-f44	5	21	277732	There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church 's Mission '' ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . 
13348	br-f44	5	22	277784	A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . 
13349	br-f44	5	23	277801	If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . 
13350	br-f44	5	24	277820	The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . 
13351	br-f44	5	25	277857	( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) 
13352	br-f44	5	26	277891	In a mobile society , congregational health depends_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like elements will have_to be assimilated . 
13353	br-f44	6	27	277947	Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation . 
13354	br-f44	6	28	277972	In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per_cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' . 
13355	br-f44	6	29	277996	If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per_cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact . 
13356	br-f44	6	30	278036	On the surface , this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care_for new people ; the new people respond in_kind by joining the church . 
13357	br-f44	7	31	278074	Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations . 
13358	br-f44	7	32	278124	This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking_up the wave_lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social_class nucleus of the congregation . 
13359	br-f44	7	33	278189	Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so_long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless - friendly contacts no_longer keep it going . 
13360	br-f44	8	34	278239	The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational_activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members . 
13361	br-f44	8	35	278265	The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per_cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) . 
13362	br-f44	8	36	278303	Publicity accounted_for 1.1 per_cent of the initial contacts with new members . 
13363	br-f44	8	37	278315	In_general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account_for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood . 
13364	br-f44	8	38	278381	The inner life of congregations will prosper so_long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; the outer life of congregations - the suitability of the environment to their survival - will be propitious so_long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership . 
13365	br-f44	8	39	278439	Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . 
13366	br-f44	8	40	278463	In a rapidly changing society congregations will run_into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more_than a single generation . 
13367	br-f44	8	41	278494	The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of_this struggle to maintain economic balance . 
13368	br-f44	8	42	278527	The expense of_this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development . 
13369	br-f44	9	43	278584	It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings . 
13370	br-f44	9	44	278614	These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis . 
13371	br-f44	9	45	278626	Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions . 
13372	br-f44	9	46	278635	The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; the schism between central_city and suburb , Negro and White , blue_collar and white_collar can be viewed_as symptomatic_of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis . 
13373	br-f44	9	47	278675	It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved_with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social_class identity of middle-class residential groupings . 
13374	br-f44	9	48	278705	The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations . 
13375	br-f44	9	49	278724	This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment . 
13376	br-f44	9	50	278737	More_than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples . 
13377	br-f44	10	51	278780	Since American life is committed above_all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis . 
13378	br-f44	10	52	278819	Consumer communities have suffered at_the_hands_of the productive interests . 
13379	br-f44	10	53	278828	Negroes , Puerto_Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities . 
13380	br-f44	10	54	278844	Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century . 
13381	br-f44	10	55	278876	The identification of the basic unit of religious organization - the parish or congregation - with a residential area is self_defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron_trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation . 
13382	br-f44	10	56	278926	Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle_classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion . 
13383	br-f44	11	57	278951	This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches . 
13384	br-f44	11	58	278973	It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle_classes . 
13385	br-f44	11	59	279001	It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities . 
13386	br-f44	11	60	279021	Whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to_which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people . 
13387	br-f44	12	61	279050	Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ; this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle_classes . 
13388	br-f44	12	62	279082	The keynotes of_this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem . 
13389	br-f44	12	63	279096	These values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations . 
13390	br-f44	12	64	279145	`` Fellowship by likeness '' and `` mission by friendly contact '' form the iron_cage of denominational religion . 
13391	br-f44	12	65	279164	Its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation . 
13392	br-f44	12	66	279182	What goes_on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church . 
13393	br-f44	12	67	279199	An understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron_cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity . 
13394	br-f44	13	68	279233	The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle_classes turn_to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need . 
13395	br-g12	1	1	279263	Nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour . 
13396	br-g12	1	2	279273	His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday , and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve . 
13397	br-g12	1	3	279299	He was waiting . 
13398	br-g12	2	4	279303	My wish to meet Samuel_Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work . 
13399	br-g12	2	5	279320	American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic . 
13400	br-g12	2	6	279330	They find deep pessimism in them . 
13401	br-g12	2	7	279337	Even so astute a commentator as Harold_Clurman of The Nation has said that `` Waiting_for_Godot '' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair '' . 
13402	br-g12	2	8	279366	But to me Beckett 's writing had seemed permeated with love for human_beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism . 
13403	br-g12	2	9	279396	Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? 
13404	br-g12	2	10	279409	Is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ? 
13405	br-g12	2	11	279424	Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ? 
13406	br-g12	3	12	279439	I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing : in_the_last_analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself . 
13407	br-g12	3	13	279477	Nevertheless I was curious . 
13408	br-g12	4	14	279482	My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a Jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near Paris . 
13409	br-g12	4	15	279518	When Beckett 's name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett `` hates life '' . 
13410	br-g12	4	16	279541	That , I thought , is at_least one thing I can find_out when we meet . 
13411	br-g12	5	17	279557	Beckett 's appearance is rough-hewn Irish . 
13412	br-g12	5	18	279564	The features of his face are distinct , but not fine . 
13413	br-g12	5	19	279576	They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel . 
13414	br-g12	5	20	279589	Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle . 
13415	br-g12	5	21	279621	One might say it combines the man ; own pride and humility . 
13416	br-g12	5	22	279634	For he has the pride that comes of self_acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another . 
13417	br-g12	5	23	279660	His light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are actively and continually looking . 
13418	br-g12	5	24	279677	He seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face . 
13419	br-g12	5	25	279707	The mouth frequently breaks_into a disarming smile . 
13420	br-g12	5	26	279715	The voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage . 
13421	br-g12	5	27	279732	The Irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the French . 
13422	br-g12	5	28	279750	His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green . 
13423	br-g12	5	29	279760	He wore a brown knit sports_shirt with no tie . 
13424	br-g12	6	30	279770	We walked down the Rue_de_L_'_Arcade , thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church . 
13425	br-g12	6	31	279791	The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world_shattering . 
13426	br-g12	6	32	279807	For_one_thing , the world that Beckett sees is already shattered . 
13427	br-g12	6	33	279818	His talk turns_to what he calls `` the mess '' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion '' . 
13428	br-g12	6	34	279837	I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation . 
13429	br-g12	6	35	279849	What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words . 
13430	br-g12	7	36	279867	`` The confusion is not my invention . 
13431	br-g12	7	37	279875	We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion . 
13432	br-g12	7	38	279892	It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in . 
13433	br-g12	7	39	279908	The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess . 
13434	br-g12	7	40	279923	It is not a mess you can make sense of '' . 
13435	br-g12	8	41	279935	I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth , but Beckett did not take_to the word truth . 
13436	br-g12	9	42	279958	`` What is more true than anything else ? 
13437	br-g12	9	43	279967	To swim is true , and to sink is true . 
13438	br-g12	9	44	279978	One is not more true than the other . 
13439	br-g12	9	45	279987	One cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess . 
13440	br-g12	9	46	280002	When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , I do n't know , but their language is too philosophical for me . 
13441	br-g12	9	47	280034	I am not a philosopher . 
13442	br-g12	9	48	280040	One can only speak of what is in_front of him , and that now is simply the mess '' . 
13443	br-g12	10	49	280060	Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form . 
13444	br-g12	10	50	280076	Until recently , art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things . 
13445	br-g12	10	51	280088	It has held them at_bay . 
13446	br-g12	10	52	280094	It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form . 
13447	br-g12	10	53	280105	`` How could the mess be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be '' ? 
13448	br-g12	10	54	280138	But now we can keep it out no_longer , because we have come into a time when `` it invades our experience at every moment . 
13449	br-g12	10	55	280164	It is there and it must be allowed_in '' . 
13450	br-g12	11	56	280174	I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously . 
13451	br-g12	11	57	280198	And why not ? 
13452	br-g12	11	58	280202	How , I asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? 
13453	br-g12	11	59	280214	Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? 
13454	br-g12	11	60	280228	If we look_at recent art we find it preoccupied with form . 
13455	br-g12	11	61	280240	Beckett 's own work is an example . 
13456	br-g12	11	62	280248	Plays more highly formalized than `` Waiting_for_Godot '' , `` Endgame '' , and `` Krapp 's_Last_Tape '' would be hard to find . 
13457	br-g12	12	63	280272	`` What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art . 
13458	br-g12	12	64	280290	It only means that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else . 
13459	br-g12	12	65	280329	The form and the chaos remain separate . 
13460	br-g12	12	66	280337	The latter is not reduced to the former . 
13461	br-g12	12	67	280346	That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation , because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates . 
13462	br-g12	12	68	280369	To find a form that accommodates the mess , that is the task of the artist now '' . 
13463	br-g12	13	69	280388	Yet , I responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ? 
13464	br-g12	13	70	280406	Is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify , demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never predictable way ? 
13465	br-g12	13	71	280438	What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ? 
13466	br-g12	13	72	280477	Is n't all art ambiguous ? 
13467	br-g12	14	73	280483	`` Not this '' , he said , and gestured toward the Madeleine . 
13468	br-g12	14	74	280497	The classical lines of the church which Napoleon thought_of as a Temple of Glory , dominated all the scene where we sat . 
13469	br-g12	14	75	280520	The Boulevard_de_la_Madeleine , the Boulevard_Malesherbes , and the Rue_Royale ran to it with graceful flattery , bearing tidings of the Age_of_Reason . 
13470	br-g12	14	76	280542	`` Not this . 
13471	br-g12	14	77	280546	This is clear . 
13472	br-g12	14	78	280550	This does not allow the mystery to invade us . 
13473	br-g12	14	79	280560	With classical art , all is settled . 
13474	br-g12	14	80	280568	But it is different at Chartres . 
13475	br-g12	14	81	280575	There is the unexplainable , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer '' . 
13476	br-g12	15	82	280594	I asked about the battle between life and death in his plays . 
13477	br-g12	15	83	280607	Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide ; Hamm 's world is death and Clov may or may_not get_out of it to join the living child outside . 
13478	br-g12	15	84	280637	Is this life_death question a part of the chaos ? 
13479	br-g12	16	85	280647	`` Yes . 
13480	br-g12	16	86	280650	If life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability . 
13481	br-g12	16	87	280668	If there were only darkness , all would be clear . 
13482	br-g12	16	88	280679	It is because there is not_only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable . 
13483	br-g12	16	89	280695	Take Augustine 's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld : have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology ? 
13484	br-g12	16	90	280716	Two thieves are crucified with Christ , one saved and the other damned . 
13485	br-g12	16	91	280730	How can we make sense of this division ? 
13486	br-g12	16	92	280739	In classical drama , such problems do not arise . 
13487	br-g12	16	93	280749	The destiny of Racine 's Phedre is sealed from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark . 
13488	br-g12	16	94	280768	As she goes , she herself will be illuminated . 
13489	br-g12	16	95	280778	At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark . 
13490	br-g12	16	96	280811	That is the play . 
13491	br-g12	16	97	280816	Within this notion clarity is possible , but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there is not such clarity . 
13492	br-g12	16	98	280838	The question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary - total salvation . 
13493	br-g12	16	99	280854	But where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable . 
13494	br-g12	16	100	280868	The key word in my plays is ' perhaps '' ' . 
13495	br-g12	17	101	280880	Given a theological lead , I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays . 
13496	br-g12	18	102	280901	`` Well , really there is none at_all . 
13497	br-g12	18	103	280910	I have no religious feeling . 
13498	br-g12	18	104	280916	Once I had a religious emotion . 
13499	br-g12	18	105	280923	It was at my first Communion . 
13500	br-g12	18	106	280930	No_more . 
13501	br-g12	18	107	280932	My mother was deeply religious . 
13502	br-g12	18	108	280938	So was my brother . 
13503	br-g12	18	109	280943	He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel . 
13504	br-g12	18	110	280956	My father had none . 
13505	br-g12	18	111	280961	The family was Protestant , but for me it was only irksome and I let it go . 
13506	br-g12	18	112	280979	My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died . 
13507	br-g12	18	113	280993	At the moment of crisis it had no_more depth than an old school tie . 
13508	br-g12	18	114	281008	Irish Catholicism is not attractive , but it is deeper . 
13509	br-g12	18	115	281019	When you pass a church on an Irish bus , all the hands flurry in the sign_of_the_cross . 
13510	br-g12	18	116	281037	One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs '' . 
13511	br-g12	19	117	281054	But do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with ? 
13512	br-g12	20	118	281071	`` Yes , for they deal with distress . 
13513	br-g12	20	119	281080	Some people object to this in my writing . 
13514	br-g12	20	120	281089	At a party an English intellectual - so-called - asked me why I write always about distress . 
13515	br-g12	20	121	281107	As if it were perverse to do so ! 
13516	br-g12	20	122	281116	He wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run_away from home to give me an unhappy childhood . 
13517	br-g12	20	123	281140	I told him no , that I had had a very happy childhood . 
13518	br-g12	20	124	281154	Then he thought me more perverse than ever . 
13519	br-g12	20	125	281163	I left the party as soon as possible and got_into a taxi . 
13520	br-g12	20	126	281176	On the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs : 
13521	br-g12	20	127	281189	one asked for help for the blind , another help for orphans , and the third for relief for the war refugees . 
13522	br-g12	20	128	281212	One does not have to look_for distress . 
13523	br-g12	20	129	281220	It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London '' . 
13524	br-g12	21	130	281233	Lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us . 
13525	br-g12	22	131	281255	The personal quality of Samuel_Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays . 
13526	br-g12	22	132	281271	He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern . 
13527	br-g12	22	133	281282	`` Perhaps '' stands in_place of commitment . 
13528	br-g12	22	134	281290	At_the_same_time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly . 
13529	br-g12	22	135	281300	If there were only the mess , all would be clear ; but there is also compassion . 
13530	br-g12	23	136	281318	As a Christian , I know I do not stand where Beckett stands , but I do see much of what he sees . 
13531	br-g12	23	137	281342	As a writer on the theater , I have paid close attention to the plays . 
13532	br-g12	23	138	281358	Harold_Clurman is right to say that `` Waiting_for_Godot '' is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of Europe 's present politics , ethic , and common way_of_life '' . 
13533	br-g12	23	139	281397	Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to . 
13534	br-g12	23	140	281408	`` Waiting_for_Godot '' sells even better in America than in France . 
13535	br-g12	23	141	281420	The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature '' societies arrive_at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not strictly practical ends of culture . 
13536	br-g12	23	142	281469	America is now joining Europe in this `` mature '' phase of development . 
13537	br-g12	23	143	281483	Whether any of us remain in it long will depend_on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going_on in the countries of Asia and Africa , and also of_course on how long the cold_war remains cold . 
13538	br-g14	1	1	281525	There were fences in the old days when we were children . 
13539	br-g14	1	2	281537	Across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles . 
13540	br-g14	1	3	281563	Alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one 's head , but not so high as the golden_glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them . 
13541	br-g14	1	4	281597	Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred_leaf roses ; front fences were covered with Virginia_creeper or trumpet_vines or honeysuckle . 
13542	br-g14	1	5	281618	Square corner - and gate_posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage ; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail : high_pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable . 
13543	br-g14	1	6	281650	On these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang . 
13544	br-g14	2	7	281667	The only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple_tree . 
13545	br-g14	2	8	281690	The primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us . 
13546	br-g14	2	9	281716	What one actually remembers is its greenness . 
13547	br-g14	2	10	281724	From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible . 
13548	br-g14	2	11	281748	One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower . 
13549	br-g14	2	12	281763	Every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit_trees . 
13550	br-g14	2	13	281783	In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet_shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead . 
13551	br-g14	2	14	281805	From above one could only occasionally catch_a_glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block . 
13552	br-g14	3	15	281861	That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch . 
13553	br-g14	3	16	281870	Another had ended before it began . 
13554	br-g14	3	17	281877	Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; the tricks that time plays_with memory and memory with time are queerest of all . 
13555	br-g14	3	18	281902	From maturity one looks_back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large . 
13556	br-g14	3	19	281930	In a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a_lot of water ; the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it . 
13557	br-g14	3	20	281966	Time in the sum is nothing . 
13558	br-g14	3	21	281973	And yet - a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one 's being - a certain mental landscape - will seem to have endured without beginning and without end . 
13559	br-g14	3	22	282012	The part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , `` It could have been like that for only a_little while '' ; but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time . 
13560	br-g14	4	23	282061	Once , then - for how many years or how few does not matter - my world was bound round by fences , when I was too small to reach the apple_tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up . 
13561	br-g14	4	24	282106	That world was in scale with my own smallness . 
13562	br-g14	4	25	282116	I have no picture in my mind of the garden as_a_whole - that I could not see - but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November ; ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned_over by a dusty slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown edged holes ; hot colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on_our_way to the pump with the half gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it . 
13563	br-g14	5	26	282241	It was mother who planted the verbenas . 
13564	br-g14	5	27	282249	I think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener : 
13565	br-g14	5	28	282260	she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren . 
13566	br-g14	5	29	282271	My great_grandmother , I have been told , made her garden her great pride ; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar ; she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden_heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain_lilies along the west_side of the house . 
13567	br-g14	5	30	282343	These my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending . 
13568	br-g14	5	31	282378	Three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment : the roses , whose petals might_not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose tea to drink ; the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying_on of_a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them ; and the poppies . 
13569	br-g14	5	32	282448	I have more_than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals . 
13570	br-g14	5	33	282498	Other flowers we might gather as we pleased : myrtle and white_violets from beneath the lilacs ; the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for_the_most_part beyond our reach ; snowballs ; hollyhock blossoms that , turned upside_down , make pink petticoated ladies ; and the little , dark_blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere . 
13571	br-g14	6	34	282555	More potent a charm to bring back that time_of_life than this record of a_few pictures and a_few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in_the_beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them . 
13572	br-g14	6	35	282611	Flowers , stones , and small creatures , living and dead . 
13573	br-g14	6	36	282623	Pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite ; seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch ; red and yellow columbines whose round tipped spurs were picked_off and eaten for the honey in them ; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper_bag ; bright flowers from the trumpet_vine that made `` gloves '' on the ends of ten waggling fingers . 
13574	br-g14	6	37	282700	Fuzzy caterpillars , snails with their sensitive horns , struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind_legs and commanded to `` spit tobacco , spit '' . 
13575	br-g14	6	38	282726	Dead fledgling birds , their squashed looking nakedness and the odor of decay that clung_to the hand when they had been buried in our graveyard in_front_of the purple flags . 
13576	br-g14	6	39	282756	And the cast shell of a locust , straw colored and transparent , weighing nothing , fragile but entire , with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down its back . 
13577	br-g14	6	40	282788	Every morning early , in the summer , we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells , carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high roots of the tulip_tree , where no grass grew in the dense shade . 
13578	br-g14	6	41	282855	We collected `` lucky stones '' - all the creamy translucent pebbles , worn smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway . 
13579	br-g14	6	42	282881	When these had been pocketed , we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated . 
13580	br-g14	6	43	282914	We showed them to each other and said `` Would you have guessed '' ? 
13581	br-g14	6	44	282929	Squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive : safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by . 
13582	br-g14	6	45	282970	Thus shielded , we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness ; even when the fences became a part of the game - when a vine embowered gate-post was the Sleeping_Beauty 's enchanted castle , or when Rapunzel let_down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we paid little heed to those who went_by on the path outside . 
13583	br-g14	7	46	283033	We enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school . 
13584	br-g14	7	47	283047	In the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone ; our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front_porch . 
13585	br-g14	7	48	283075	They never troubled_themselves about us while we were playing , because the fence formed such a definite boundary and `` Do n't go outside the gate '' was a command so impossible of misinterpretation . 
13586	br-g14	7	49	283110	We were not , however , entirely unacquainted_with the varying aspects of the street . 
13587	br-g14	7	50	283125	We were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes . 
13588	br-g14	8	51	283185	The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air . 
13589	br-g14	8	52	283227	Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell_away again , crushed beneath it . 
13590	br-g14	8	53	283242	A hay wagon moved slowly along the gutter , the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees , and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves . 
13591	br-g14	8	54	283276	A wheel squeaked on a hub , was still , and squeaked again . 
13592	br-g14	8	55	283290	If a child watched its progress he whispered , `` Hay , hay , load of hay - make a wish and turn_away '' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses ' feet returned no_more . 
13593	br-g14	8	56	283334	When the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster 's cart might turn the corner . 
13594	br-g14	8	57	283355	The horse walked , the reins were slack , the huckster rode with bowed shoulders , his forearms across his knees . 
13595	br-g14	8	58	283377	Sleepily , as if half reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice : `` Rhu-beb ni_ice fresh rhu-beb today '' ! 
13596	br-g14	8	59	283401	The lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee . 
13597	br-g14	8	60	283415	No one seemed to hear him , no one heeded . 
13598	br-g14	8	61	283426	The horse plodded on , and he repeated his call . 
13599	br-g14	8	62	283437	It became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness . 
13600	br-g14	8	63	283450	After his passage , the street was empty again . 
13601	br-g14	8	64	283460	The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down ; the trees ' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn . 
13602	br-g14	8	65	283485	At four o_'_clock , or four thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day ; he tossed a paper toward every front_door , and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing . 
13603	br-g14	9	66	283533	The streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer ; they were like this fifty odd years ago , and yesterday . 
13604	br-g14	9	67	283561	But the fences were still in_place fifty odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving_stones with grass between and on both sides . 
13605	br-g14	9	68	283604	The curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees . 
13606	br-g14	9	69	283633	Opposite every gate was a hitching_post or a stone carriage step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse . 
13607	br-g14	9	70	283656	The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center ; it was mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping_stones . 
13608	br-g14	9	71	283694	It had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long_since . 
13609	br-g14	9	72	283705	The hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses . 
13610	br-g14	9	73	283732	Cows were kept in backyard barns , boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , were the boys ' coaxing voices , the thud of hooves , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide . 
13611	br-g16	1	1	283787	The `` reality '' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world . 
13612	br-g16	1	2	283815	Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason . 
13613	br-g16	2	3	283826	These polar concerns ( imitation vs. formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period_of_time . 
13614	br-g16	2	4	283849	The breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given_rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes . 
13615	br-g16	2	5	283876	Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi mechanistic powers . 
13616	br-g16	2	6	283901	The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or_else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery . 
13617	br-g16	2	7	283925	The image of God has simply disappeared . 
13618	br-g16	2	8	283933	All such imitations of negative quality have given_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . 
13619	br-g16	2	9	284003	The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems . 
13620	br-g16	3	10	284034	Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together . 
13621	br-g16	3	11	284071	Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being . 
13622	br-g16	3	12	284102	And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written . 
13623	br-g16	3	13	284159	For better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . 
13624	br-g16	3	14	284183	A broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcends the non artistic causal_factors out of which it arises . 
13625	br-g16	3	15	284218	On_the_other_hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs . 
13626	br-g16	3	16	284240	We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism . 
13627	br-g16	3	17	284258	Accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in_order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) . 
13628	br-g16	4	18	284310	The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle . 
13629	br-g16	4	19	284328	For Plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence . 
13630	br-g16	4	20	284359	All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . 
13631	br-g16	4	21	284394	In Plato 's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers . 
13632	br-g16	4	22	284425	Presupposed in Plato 's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom . 
13633	br-g16	4	23	284457	Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . 
13634	br-g16	4	24	284490	The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato . 
13635	br-g16	4	25	284518	But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths . 
13636	br-g16	4	26	284558	For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in_contrast_to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality . 
13637	br-g16	5	27	284583	The central concern of Erich_Auerbach 's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved . 
13638	br-g16	5	28	284627	Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels , the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures '' of divine power and reality . 
13639	br-g16	5	29	284658	Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent . 
13640	br-g16	5	30	284677	Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama . 
13641	br-g16	5	31	284697	The artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction . 
13642	br-g16	5	32	284719	He is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped . 
13643	br-g16	5	33	284734	I have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the Christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection . 
13644	br-g16	6	34	284804	In the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in_terms_of vivid images rather than in_terms_of abstract ideas or conventional designations . 
13645	br-g16	6	35	284833	By `` image '' is meant not_only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith . 
13646	br-g16	6	36	284863	This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated . 
13647	br-g16	6	37	284888	Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself . 
13648	br-g16	6	38	284920	The images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ; they are fields_of_force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one_another . 
13649	br-g16	6	39	284956	They bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality . 
13650	br-g16	6	40	284976	As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images . 
13651	br-g16	6	41	285011	Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense . 
13652	br-g16	6	42	285027	A word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings . 
13653	br-g16	6	43	285074	Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . 
13654	br-g16	6	44	285100	A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy . 
13655	br-g16	7	45	285115	The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials . 
13656	br-g16	7	46	285135	When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance . 
13657	br-g16	7	47	285217	These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice . 
13658	br-g16	7	48	285241	The presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even_though it is but vaguely understood . 
13659	br-g16	8	49	285269	Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed . 
13660	br-g16	8	50	285295	Experience is not seen , as it is in classical rationalism , as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character , movements , and changes on the tabula_rasa of an uninvolved intellect . 
13661	br-g16	8	51	285337	Neither is primary experience understood according_to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other_than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense_organs . 
13662	br-g16	8	52	285369	Primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses , trees , implements , etc . ) nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities . 
13663	br-g16	8	53	285403	In_contrast_to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers . 
13664	br-g16	9	54	285421	The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part . 
13665	br-g16	9	55	285461	These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one 's good , others threatening ill . 
13666	br-g16	9	56	285487	Gone is the tabula_rasa of the mind . 
13667	br-g16	9	57	285495	In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one 's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught . 
13668	br-g16	10	58	285532	The principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' is Alfred_North_Whitehead . 
13669	br-g16	10	59	285549	Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future . 
13670	br-g16	10	60	285593	We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening . 
13671	br-g16	10	61	285609	Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience . 
13672	br-g16	10	62	285636	It takes a great_deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one 's world simply as a collection of sense_data arranged in such_and_such sequence and pattern , devoid_of all power to move the feelings and actions except in_so_far as they present themselves for inspection . 
13673	br-g16	10	63	285693	Whitehead is here questioning David_Hume 's understanding of the nature of experience ; he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from Hume 's presupposition that experience is merely sense_data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived . 
13674	br-g16	10	64	285747	What Hume calls `` sensation '' is what Whitehead calls `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy '' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy . 
13675	br-g16	10	65	285780	As_long_as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense_data , most_of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical scepticism . 
13676	br-g16	10	66	285816	Whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each_other and which cause each_other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially given in the way man feels the world . 
13677	br-g16	10	67	285880	In this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct . 
13678	br-g16	11	68	285915	A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past . 
13679	br-g16	11	69	285934	Both I and my feelings come_up out of a chain of events that fan_out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am . 
13680	br-g17	1	1	285965	After only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to_be_sure . 
13681	br-g17	2	2	285989	There were more indications by the mid twentieth century . 
13682	br-g17	2	3	285999	I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed several a_few years ago , during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg . 
13683	br-g17	2	4	286028	In town after town my companion pointed_out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for_one_thing ) . 
13684	br-g17	2	5	286061	It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker_T._Washington had been going_on . 
13685	br-g17	2	6	286078	But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired . 
13686	br-g17	3	7	286100	For over a_hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them . 
13687	br-g17	3	8	286115	It 's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly . 
13688	br-g17	3	9	286132	By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ? 
13689	br-g17	3	10	286151	The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' ( as James 's Christopher_Newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad I may be , you 're not quite the people to say it '' . 
13690	br-g17	4	11	286212	In the pre Civil_War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory_worker of the North . 
13691	br-g17	4	12	286236	At the present_time , the counter-attack takes the line that there 's no more of the true spirit of `` integration '' in the North than in the South . 
13692	br-g17	4	13	286266	The line is a pretty good one . 
13693	br-g17	5	14	286274	People talk_about `` the law of the land '' . 
13694	br-g17	5	15	286284	The expression has become quite a cliche . 
13695	br-g17	5	16	286292	But people can n't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law . 
13696	br-g17	6	17	286314	I was having lunch not_long ago ( apologies to N._V._Peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the European Middle_Ages , one in American history , and one in the Far_East ) , and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy '' ( Francis_Thompson 's words for the Hound_of_Heaven 's pursuit ) by judicial fiat . 
13697	br-g17	6	18	286388	They did n't seem to be able to think_of any . 
13698	br-g17	7	19	286399	A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change . 
13699	br-g17	7	20	286427	But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation - the sort of change which Tacitus was talking_about when he said , `` They make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' . ) 
13700	br-g17	7	21	286476	. 
13701	br-g17	8	22	286477	Moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable ; it can be changed ; it has been , many times . 
13702	br-g17	8	23	286500	Mr._Justice_Taney 's Dred_Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North , and soon became a dead_letter . 
13703	br-g17	8	24	286518	Prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took_up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated Northeast ! ) 
13704	br-g17	8	25	286557	and was repealed . 
13705	br-g17	8	26	286561	The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a_little history . 
13706	br-g17	9	27	286574	The Declaration_of_Independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed '' . 
13707	br-g17	9	28	286592	The phrase `` consent of the governed '' needs a hard look . 
13708	br-g17	9	29	286605	How do we define it ? 
13709	br-g17	9	30	286611	Is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? 
13710	br-g17	9	31	286621	Calhoun dealt with this question in his `` Disquisition_on_Government '' . 
13711	br-g17	10	32	286632	To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , Calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority '' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation '' . 
13712	br-g17	10	33	286691	Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? 
13713	br-g17	10	34	286704	that regional peculiarities do not still exist ? 
13714	br-g17	10	35	286712	that the Court_order does not unequally affect the Southern region ? 
13715	br-g17	10	36	286723	Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed '' ? 
13716	br-g17	11	37	286752	Circumstances alter cases . 
13717	br-g17	11	38	286756	A friend of mine in New_Mexico said the Court_order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell . 
13718	br-g17	11	39	286784	He seemed a_little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere . 
13719	br-g17	11	40	286798	I murmured something about a possible difference between New_Mexico 's history and Mississippi 's . 
13720	br-g17	12	41	286813	One can meet_with aloofness almost anywhere : the Thank-Heaven-We 're_-_not-Involved viewpoint , It Does n't Affect Us ! 
13721	br-g17	12	42	286831	Southern Liberals ( there are a_good_many ) - especially if they 're rich - often exhibit blithe insouciance . 
13722	br-g17	12	43	286850	The trouble here is that it 's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it does n't cost you anything . 
13723	br-g17	12	44	286874	You 've already sent your daughter to Miss_X 's select academy for girls and your son to Mr._Y 's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity . 
13724	br-g17	12	45	286911	If there 's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there 's always New_England . 
13725	br-g17	12	46	286927	New_England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as_well_as West . 
13726	br-g17	12	47	286939	They may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns_out to be from Thailand , or any place other_than the American South . 
13727	br-g17	12	48	286968	It would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep_schools of New_England . 
13728	br-g17	12	49	286992	A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating_class of nearly one_thousand at Yale ; that_is , about one-half of one per_cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national '' . 
13729	br-g17	13	50	287040	I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith . 
13730	br-g17	13	51	287071	I leave_out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are . 
13731	br-g17	13	52	287095	I 'm talking_about the grand manner of the Liberal - North and South - who is not affected personally . 
13732	br-g17	13	53	287115	If these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ) 
13733	br-g17	13	54	287134	, what voices would be left ? 
13734	br-g17	13	55	287141	Who is involved willy_nilly ? 
13735	br-g17	13	56	287146	Well , after everybody has followed the New_England pattern of segregating one 's children into private_schools , only the poor folks are left . 
13736	br-g17	13	57	287170	And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction . 
13737	br-g17	14	58	287193	A dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew_up in the South and has spent many years in New_England , said to me not_long ago : `` I can n't forgive New_England for rejecting all complicity '' . 
13738	br-g17	14	59	287234	Being a teacher of American literature , I remembered Whittier 's `` Massachusetts_to_Virginia '' , where he said : `` But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown '' . 
13739	br-g17	14	60	287278	There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his `` English_Notebooks '' . 
13740	br-g17	14	61	287292	and one finds it again in Thomas_Nelson_Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves . 
13741	br-g17	14	62	287317	Whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value . 
13742	br-g17	15	63	287332	Complicity is an embarrassing word . 
13743	br-g17	15	64	287338	It is something which most_of us try to get_out from under . 
13744	br-g17	15	65	287350	Like the cowboy in Stephen_Crane 's `` Blue_Hotel '' , we run around crying , `` Well , I did n't do anything , did I '' ? 
13745	br-g17	15	66	287378	Robert_Penn_Warren puts it this way in `` Brother_to_Dragons '' : 
13746	br-g17	15	67	287388	`` The recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence '' , where innocence , I think , means about the same thing as redemption . 
13747	br-g17	15	68	287414	A man must be able to say , `` Father , I have sinned '' , or there is no hope for him . 
13748	br-g17	15	69	287438	Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` Second Inaugural '' that God `` gives to both North and South this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came '' . 
13749	br-g17	15	70	287479	He also spoke_of `` the wealth piled by the bondsman 's two_hundred_and_fifty years in unrequited toil '' . 
13750	br-g17	15	71	287497	Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New_Englanders engaged in the slave_trade . 
13751	br-g17	15	72	287527	After how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high_finance ) purified of taint ? 
13752	br-g17	15	73	287549	It is a question which New_Englanders long_ago put out of their minds . 
13753	br-g17	15	74	287562	But did n't they get_off too easy ? 
13754	br-g17	15	75	287570	The slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave owners : they were fed , clothed , doctored , and_so_forth ; they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care . 
13755	br-g17	16	76	287617	Emerson - Platonist , idealist , doctrinaire - sounded a high Transcendental note in his `` Boston_Hymn '' , delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music_Hall amidst thundering applause : `` Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim . 
13756	br-g17	16	77	287661	Who is the owner ? 
13757	br-g17	16	78	287666	The slave is owner , And ever was . 
13758	br-g17	16	79	287675	Pay him '' ! 
13759	br-g17	16	80	287679	It is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist . 
13760	br-g17	16	81	287692	It ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put_away long_ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) . 
13761	br-g17	16	82	287739	Like Pilate , they had washed_their_hands . 
13762	br-g17	16	83	287746	But can one , really ? 
13763	br-g17	16	84	287752	Can God be mocked , ever , in_the_long_run ? 
13764	br-g17	17	85	287761	New_Englanders were a_bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration_of_Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck_out in complaisance to South_Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on_the_contrary still wished to continue it . 
13765	br-g17	17	86	287832	Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a_little tender under those censures ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' . 
13766	br-g17	18	87	287868	But that was a long_time ago . 
13767	br-g17	18	88	287875	The New_England conscience became desensitized . 
13768	br-g17	18	89	287881	George_W._Cable ( naturalized New_Englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` Paradise_Road , Northampton '' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` Southern question '' . 
13769	br-g17	18	90	287910	It was nice to be able to isolate it . 
13770	br-g17	19	91	287920	New_England , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the Nation . 
13771	br-g17	19	92	287934	There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory_schools of the United_States . 
13772	br-g17	19	93	287955	Why should this be so ? 
13773	br-g17	19	94	287961	It is true that New_England , more_than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start . 
13774	br-g17	19	95	287980	But I think that something more than this is involved . 
13775	br-g17	20	96	287991	How did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New_England as it did in other parts of the country ? 
13776	br-g17	20	97	288025	Is n't it a_bit odd that the three states of Southern New_England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode_Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A_+_M_colleges ? 
13777	br-g17	20	98	288066	Was it supposed , perchance , that A_+_M ( vocational_training , that_is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flooded that part of the New_England world in the post Civil_War period , the immigrants having been brought_in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make_up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ? 
13778	br-g17	20	99	288127	Is it not ironical that Roger_Williams 's state , Rhode_Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? 
13779	br-g17	20	100	288153	The state universities of Maine , New_Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; they had less immigration to contend with . 
13780	br-g17	21	101	288179	A Yale historian , writing a_few years ago in The Yale_Review , said : `` We in New_England have long_since segregated our children '' . 
13781	br-g17	21	102	288204	He was referring not_only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory_schools . 
13782	br-g17	21	103	288220	And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land ! 
13783	br-g17	21	104	288231	I do n't propose to go into their history , but I have one or two surmises . 
13784	br-g17	21	105	288249	One is that they were established , or gained eminence , under pressure provided by these same immigrants , from whom the old families wished to segregate their children . 
13785	br-g17	21	106	288279	In the early_days of a homogeneous population , the public_school was quite satisfactory . 
13786	br-g18	1	1	288293	Among the recipients of the Nobel_Prize for Literature more_than half are practically unknown to readers of English . 
13787	br-g18	1	2	288311	Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner_von_Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago . 
13788	br-g18	1	3	288346	Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . 
13789	br-g18	1	4	288370	In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as_much_as_possible speak_for himself . 
13790	br-g18	2	5	288390	Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family . 
13791	br-g18	2	6	288401	On his father 's side he was of German descent , on his mother 's he came of the old Swedish nobility . 
13792	br-g18	2	7	288424	The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake_Va ^ ttern in south central Sweden . 
13793	br-g18	2	8	288440	It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations . 
13794	br-g18	2	9	288457	As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden 's ancient glory . 
13795	br-g18	2	10	288485	He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part . 
13796	br-g18	2	11	288500	Being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe , for which he at_once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all_of the following ten years abroad , at_first in Italy , then in Greece , Egypt , Asia_Minor , and Palestine . 
13797	br-g18	2	12	288553	In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth . 
13798	br-g18	3	13	288579	Deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie_in that direction . 
13799	br-g18	3	14	288618	He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` The_Happy_Artists '' . 
13800	br-g18	3	15	288636	`` I scanned the world through printed_symbol swart , And through the beggar 's rags I strove to see The inner man . 
13801	br-g18	3	16	288659	I looked unceasingly With my cold mind and with my burning heart '' . 
13802	br-g18	3	17	288673	In this final line , we have the key to his nature . 
13803	br-g18	3	18	288686	Few writers have better understood their deepest selves . 
13804	br-g18	3	19	288695	Heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface . 
13805	br-g18	3	20	288703	It may , however , be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris . 
13806	br-g18	4	21	288728	The first result of Heidenstam 's long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems , Pilgrimage_and_Wander_Years ( Vallfart_och_vandringsar ) , published in 1888 . 
13807	br-g18	4	22	288752	It was a brilliant debut , so_much_so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did Byron 's Childe_Harold . 
13808	br-g18	4	23	288777	Professor_Fredrik_Bo ^ o ^ k , Sweden 's foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as_follows : `` In this we have the verse of a painter ; strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid . 
13809	br-g18	4	24	288815	In a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic ; all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively . 
13810	br-g18	4	25	288845	The young poet painter reproduces the French life of the streets ; he tells stories of the Thousand_and_One_Nights , and conjures_up before us the bazaars of Damascus . 
13811	br-g18	4	26	288873	In the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it . 
13812	br-g18	4	27	288899	And yet amid all the gay hedonism in Pilgrimage and Wander-Years is a cycle of short poems , '' Thoughts_in_Loneliness `` , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing '' . 
13813	br-g18	5	28	288932	Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as `` Nameless_and_Immortal '' , which at_once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language . 
13814	br-g18	5	29	288963	It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum , next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence . 
13815	br-g18	5	30	288992	On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection . 
13816	br-g18	5	31	289019	The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality . 
13817	br-g18	5	32	289039	Not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal . 
13818	br-g18	5	33	289057	`` The man 's true reputation is his work '' . 
13819	br-g18	6	34	289068	The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as `` Thoughts_in_Loneliness '' is , as Professor_Bo ^ o ^ k indicated , in sharp contrast with the others . 
13820	br-g18	6	35	289099	It consists_of fragmentary personal revelations , such_as `` The_Spark '' : 
13821	br-g18	6	36	289110	`` There is a spark dwells deep within my soul . 
13822	br-g18	6	37	289121	To get it out into the daylight 's glow Is my life 's aim both first and last , the whole . 
13823	br-g18	6	38	289143	It slips_away , it burns and tortures me . 
13824	br-g18	6	39	289152	That little spark is all the wealth I know , That little spark is my life 's misery '' . 
13825	br-g18	6	40	289172	A dominant motive is the poet 's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations : `` Not men folk , but the fields where I would stray , The stones where as a child I used_to play '' . 
13826	br-g18	6	41	289212	He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading . 
13827	br-g18	6	42	289228	What he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause '' to which he can honestly devote himself . 
13828	br-g18	6	43	289248	This restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden . 
13829	br-g18	6	44	289269	His cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present . 
13830	br-g18	7	45	289291	He did not , however , find_himself at_once . 
13831	br-g18	7	46	289300	His next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans_Alienus , which Professor_Bo ^ o ^ k describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth . 
13832	br-g18	7	47	289340	The hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort_of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor_Bo ^ o ^ k again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life . 
13833	br-g18	7	48	289398	He is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden '' . 
13834	br-g18	8	49	289419	From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self . 
13835	br-g18	8	50	289431	By the death of his father in 1888 he had come_into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions . 
13836	br-g18	8	51	289453	He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were . 
13837	br-g18	8	52	289469	Like his friend and contemporary August_Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity . 
13838	br-g18	8	53	289483	He saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory . 
13839	br-g18	8	54	289505	Strindberg 's remedy for this condition was to tear_down the old structures and build anew from the ground up . 
13840	br-g18	8	55	289525	Heidenstam 's conception , on_the_contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past . 
13841	br-g18	9	56	289543	Whether in prose or poetry , all_of Heidenstam 's later work was concerned with Sweden . 
13842	br-g18	9	57	289559	With the first of a group of historical novels , The_Charles_Men_(_Karolinerna ) , published in 1897_-_8 , he achieved the masterpiece of his career . 
13843	br-g18	9	58	289584	In scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy 's War_and_Peace . 
13844	br-g18	9	59	289598	About one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic . 
13845	br-g18	9	60	289620	Though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles_12 , , the true hero is not finally the king himself . 
13846	br-g18	9	61	289643	Hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king ; on the fatal battlefield of Poltava , to quote from the novel , `` the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people '' . 
13847	br-g18	10	62	289687	The_Charles_Men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short_stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject . 
13848	br-g18	10	63	289711	Somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature . 
13849	br-g18	10	64	289735	They comprise a great variety of scene and interest : grim episodes of war , idyllic interludes , superb canvases of world-shaking events , and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters . 
13850	br-g18	10	65	289767	The general effect is tragic . 
13851	br-g18	10	66	289773	Almost nothing is said of Charles ' spectacular victories , the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat . 
13852	br-g18	11	67	289803	To carry_out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale . 
13853	br-g18	11	68	289834	His peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity . 
13854	br-g18	11	69	289848	George_Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style . 
13855	br-g18	11	70	289859	Of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam . 
13856	br-g18	11	71	289870	The_Charles_Men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more_than of major figures . 
13857	br-g18	11	72	289887	The career of Charles_12 , is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon . 
13858	br-g18	11	73	289901	His ideal was Alexander_of_Macedon , as Napoleon 's was Julius_Caesar . 
13859	br-g18	11	74	289912	His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice . 
13860	br-g18	11	75	289933	Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god . 
13861	br-g18	11	76	289954	Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him . 
13862	br-g18	11	77	289973	Each is still glorified as a national hero . 
13863	br-g18	12	78	289982	The first half of The_Charles_Men , ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second . 
13864	br-g18	12	79	290008	After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous . 
13865	br-g18	12	80	290038	Like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers . 
13866	br-g18	12	81	290048	There are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity . 
13867	br-g18	12	82	290073	Then more_than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness . 
13868	br-g18	12	83	290086	This comes_out in `` When_the_Bells_Ring '' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes . 
13869	br-g18	13	84	290111	In `` The_King 's_Ride '' , Charles breaks_out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years . 
13870	br-g18	13	85	290150	He finds it in utter misery and desolation . 
13871	br-g18	13	86	290159	All his people ask for is no more war . 
13872	br-g18	13	87	290169	But he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of_age when he died . 
13873	br-g18	13	88	290202	He had become king at fifteen . 
13874	br-g18	14	89	290209	Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling . 
13875	br-g18	14	90	290220	From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden . 
13876	br-g18	14	91	290245	This is brought_out in the next_to_last chapter of the book , `` A_Hero 's Funeral '' , written in the form of an impassioned prose_poem . 
13877	br-g18	14	92	290271	Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes_through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories . 
13878	br-g18	14	93	290300	The guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors . 
13879	br-g18	14	94	290330	As he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga . 
13880	br-g18	15	95	290345	Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory . 
13881	br-g18	15	96	290360	Excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of The_Charles_Men , and need not detain us here . 
13882	br-g18	15	97	290380	It is different with his volume The_Swedes_and_Their_Chieftains ( Svenskarna_och_deras_ho ^_vdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high_school students . 
13883	br-g18	15	98	290406	Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries . 
13884	br-g18	15	99	290423	Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background . 
13885	br-g18	15	100	290441	These are suggestive_of Selma_Lagerlo ^ f . 
13886	br-g18	15	101	290448	Especially touching is the chapter , `` The_Little_Sister '' , about a king 's daughter who became a nun in the convent of St._Birgitta . 
13887	br-g18	15	102	290473	The record teems with romance and adventure . 
13888	br-g18	15	103	290481	Gustaf_Vasa is a superb example , and Charles_10 , , the conqueror of Denmark , hardly less so . 
13889	br-g18	15	104	290500	Of Gustavus_Adolphus and Charles_12 , it is unnecessary to speak . 
13890	br-g19	1	1	290511	Today the private_detective will also investigate insurance_claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not . 
13891	br-g19	1	2	290550	It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private_detective was recruited . 
13892	br-g19	2	3	290563	The mythological private_eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways . 
13893	br-g19	2	4	290578	On_the_one_hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed . 
13894	br-g19	2	5	290595	As a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client . 
13895	br-g19	2	6	290614	For this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine . 
13896	br-g19	2	7	290644	On_the_other_hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; no client would ever think_of asking him to do such things . 
13897	br-g19	2	8	290670	Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private_eye ends_up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder . 
13898	br-g19	2	9	290690	Operating as a one_man police_force in fact if not in_name , he is at_once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves . 
13899	br-g19	2	10	290714	He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at_all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished . 
13900	br-g19	2	11	290754	Thus the fictional detective is much more_than a simple businessman . 
13901	br-g19	2	12	290765	He is , first_and_foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . 
13902	br-g19	3	13	290781	It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts_for the great appeal of the mythological detective . 
13903	br-g19	3	14	290802	By_virtue_of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private_eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle_class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let_the_devil_take_the_hindmost . 
13904	br-g19	3	15	290838	At_the_same_time , because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle_class eyes a virtuous man . 
13905	br-g19	3	16	290872	In this way , the private_detective gets the best of two possible worlds . 
13906	br-g19	3	17	290886	He is an individualist but not an anarchist ; he is a public servant but not a cop . 
13907	br-g19	3	18	290905	In_short , the fictional private_eye is a specialized version of Adam_Smith 's ideal entrepreneur , the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare . 
13908	br-g19	3	19	290934	In the mystery_story , as in The_Wealth_of_Nations , individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin . 
13909	br-g19	4	20	290956	There is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : 
13910	br-g19	4	21	290966	Adam_Smith was wrong . 
13911	br-g19	4	22	290970	Not_only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism . 
13912	br-g19	4	23	290998	The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe and the United_States dates_from the period 1880 - 1900 . 
13913	br-g19	4	24	291017	Now , although the roots of the mystery_story in serious literature go_back as far as Balzac , Dickens , and Poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19_th century that the private_detective became an established figure in popular fiction . 
13914	br-g19	4	25	291061	Sherlock_Holmes , the ancestor of all private_eyes , was born during the 1890 s . 
13915	br-g19	4	26	291076	Thus the transformation of Adam_Smith 's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life . 
13916	br-g19	4	27	291101	Driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private_detective . 
13917	br-g19	4	28	291119	The birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal . 
13918	br-g19	5	29	291132	Even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give_rise to the mystery_story are not fully resolved . 
13919	br-g19	5	30	291152	The individualism and public service of the private_detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code_of_conduct : he enforces the law without being told to do so . 
13920	br-g19	5	31	291181	The private_eye is therefore a moral man ; but his morality rests upon that of his society . 
13921	br-g19	5	32	291199	The basic premise of all mystery_stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal . 
13922	br-g19	5	33	291222	Unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good . 
13923	br-g19	5	34	291232	As capitalism in the 20_th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private_detective is placed in a serious dilemma . 
13924	br-g19	5	35	291259	If he is good , he may not be legal ; if he is legal , he may not be good . 
13925	br-g19	5	36	291281	It is the gradual unfolding and deepening of_this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery_story . 
13926	br-g19	6	37	291302	With the advent of Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle 's Sherlock_Holmes , the development of the modern private_detective begins . 
13927	br-g19	6	38	291318	Sherlock_Holmes is not merely an individualist ; he is very close to being a mental_case . 
13928	br-g19	6	39	291334	A brief list of the great detective 's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr._Freud with ample food_for_thought . 
13929	br-g19	6	40	291351	Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants ; he is prone to semi catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln ; he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist . 
13930	br-g19	6	41	291392	Holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds . 
13931	br-g19	6	42	291410	His eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom . 
13932	br-g19	6	43	291419	It was in_order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle_class life that Holmes became a detective in_the_first_place . 
13933	br-g19	6	44	291437	As he informs Watson , `` My life is spent in one long effort to escape_from the commonplaces of existence . 
13934	br-g19	6	45	291458	These little problems help me to do so '' . 
13935	br-g19	6	46	291468	Holmes is a public servant , to_be_sure ; but the society which he serves bores him to tears . 
13936	br-g19	7	47	291487	The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland_Yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior . 
13937	br-g19	7	48	291507	Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland_Yard , Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police . 
13938	br-g19	7	49	291531	They for their part are convinced that Holmes is too `` unorthodox '' and `` theoretical '' to make a good detective . 
13939	br-g19	7	50	291554	Why do the police find Holmes `` unorthodox '' ? 
13940	br-g19	7	51	291564	On_the_face_of_it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine . 
13941	br-g19	7	52	291579	Another , more interesting explanation , is hinted at by Watson when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would have made a magnificent criminal . 
13942	br-g19	7	53	291605	The great detective modestly agrees . 
13943	br-g19	7	54	291611	Watson 's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch opponent , Dr._Moriarty . 
13944	br-g19	7	55	291629	The two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness . 
13945	br-g19	7	56	291646	The first series of Sherlock_Holmes adventures ends with Holmes and Moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff . 
13946	br-g19	7	57	291666	They are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in_this fatal embrace . 
13947	br-g19	7	58	291680	Linked to Holmes even in death , Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of_what our hero might have become were he not a public servant . 
13948	br-g19	7	59	291711	Just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the detective , so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both . 
13949	br-g19	8	60	291731	In the modern English `` whodunnit '' , this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared . 
13950	br-g19	8	61	291753	Hercule_Poirot and Lord_Peter_Whimsey ( the respective creations of Agatha_Christie and Dorothy_Sayers ) have retained Holmes ' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits . 
13951	br-g19	8	62	291780	Poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people ; it is true that they are also extremely dull . 
13952	br-g19	8	63	291799	Their dedication to the status_quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a Sherlock_Holmes . 
13953	br-g19	8	64	291820	The latter 's real descendents were unable to take_root in England ; they fled from the Victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy Atlantic . 
13954	br-g19	8	65	291847	In the American `` hardboiled '' detective_story of the ' 20 s and ' 30 s , the spirit of the mad genius from Baker_Street lives on . 
13955	br-g19	9	66	291875	Like Holmes , the American private_eye rejects the social conventions of his time . 
13956	br-g19	9	67	291889	But unlike Holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt . 
13957	br-g19	9	68	291906	Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hardboiled '' private_eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation . 
13958	br-g19	9	69	291930	His alienation is far more acute than Holmes ' ; he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast . 
13959	br-g19	9	70	291950	With Rex_Stout 's Nero_Wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane . 
13960	br-g19	9	71	291964	Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends most_of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids . 
13961	br-g19	9	72	291985	More profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation of Raymond_Chandler 's Philip_Marlowe . 
13962	br-g19	9	73	292002	In a society where everything is for_sale , Marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought . 
13963	br-g19	9	74	292020	His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence . 
13964	br-g19	9	75	292032	Beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high_society and low morals , always alone , always despised . 
13965	br-g19	9	76	292058	In_the_end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care ; virtue is its own and only reward . 
13966	br-g19	9	77	292080	A similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric_Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery_stories , Dashiell_Hammett 's The Maltese_Falcon . 
13967	br-g19	9	78	292109	Sam_Spade joins_forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; but when the bird is found at_last , it turns_out to be a fake . 
13968	br-g19	9	79	292142	Now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer . 
13969	br-g19	9	80	292165	For Sam_Spade , neither crime nor virtue pays ; moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two . 
13970	br-g19	10	81	292186	Because the private_eye intends to save society in_spite_of himself , he invariably finds himself in_trouble with the police . 
13971	br-g19	10	82	292205	The latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care . 
13972	br-g19	10	83	292221	In either case , they do not appreciate the private_detective 's zeal . 
13973	br-g19	10	84	292234	Perry_Mason and Hamilton_Burger , Nero_Wolfe and Inspector_Cramer spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking_for the criminal . 
13974	br-g19	10	85	292255	Frequently enough , the police are themselves in_league_with the killer ; Dashiell_Hammett 's Red_Harvest provides a classic example of_this theme . 
13975	br-g19	10	86	292276	But even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private_eye . 
13976	br-g19	10	87	292291	He is , like Phillip_Marlowe , too alienated to be reliable . 
13977	br-g19	10	88	292303	Finally , in The Maltese_Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam_Spade becomes the chief murder_suspect . 
13978	br-g19	10	89	292330	In_order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl_friend . 
13979	br-g19	10	90	292351	What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock_Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private_eye is in danger of turning_into his opposite . 
13980	br-g19	11	91	292379	It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery_story which creates this fatal dilemma . 
13981	br-g19	11	92	292398	By upholding his own personal code_of_behavior , the private_detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption . 
13982	br-g19	11	93	292424	That society responds by condemning the private_eye as a threat to the status_quo , a potential criminal . 
13983	br-g19	11	94	292442	If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society . 
13984	br-g19	11	95	292464	He must , in_short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel . 
13985	br-g19	11	96	292479	On_the_other_hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism . 
13986	br-g19	11	97	292503	Dashiell_Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery_stories and turning_to other pursuits . 
13987	br-g19	11	98	292517	His successors have adopted the opposite alternative . 
13988	br-g19	11	99	292525	In_order to save the mystery_story , they have converted the private_detective into an organization man . 
13989	br-g19	12	100	292541	The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by Mickey_Spillane 's Mike_Hammer . 
13990	br-g19	12	101	292557	At_first_glance , this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors . 
13991	br-g19	12	102	292577	For Hammer , nothing is forbidden . 
13992	br-g19	12	103	292584	He kills when he pleases , takes his women where he finds them and always acts_as judge , jury and executioner rolled_into_one . 
13993	br-g20	1	1	292607	It will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required , because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in Table 1 . 
13994	br-g20	1	2	292646	Great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network . 
13995	br-g20	1	3	292668	By monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers . 
13996	br-g20	2	4	292688	As a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or exclamation . 
13997	br-g20	2	5	292721	For_example , suppose a man wearing a $ 200 watch , driving a 1959 Rolls_Royce , stops to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` What time is it '' ? 
13998	br-g20	2	6	292753	This sentence would have most_of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car . 
13999	br-g20	2	7	292798	If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation . 
14000	br-g20	2	8	292817	Also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command . 
14001	br-g20	2	9	292851	However , for convenience we will stick_to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 . 
14002	br-g20	2	10	292870	On this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes . 
14003	br-g20	3	11	292886	Presumably a cocktail_party is expected to fulfill the host 's desire to get_together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors . 
14004	br-g20	3	12	292924	The party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another . 
14005	br-g20	3	13	292946	The information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air_waves , and is received by the ears . 
14006	br-g20	3	14	292972	Since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net . 
14007	br-g20	3	15	293002	As shown in Figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points . 
14008	br-g20	3	16	293020	This , and other qualifications , make the cocktail_party the most complete and most chaotic communication_system ever dreamed_up . 
14009	br-g20	3	17	293039	All four types of message listed in Table 1 are permitted , although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum , while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more_than customarily encouraged . 
14010	br-g20	3	18	293074	The completeness of the connections provide that , for N people , there are * * f lines of communication between the pairs , which can become a large_number ( 1225 ) for a party of fifty guests . 
14011	br-g20	3	19	293113	Looking at the diagram , we see that * * f connection lines come in to each member . 
14012	br-g20	3	20	293132	Thus the cocktail_party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness . 
14013	br-g20	3	21	293149	In_spite_of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group , the * * f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving_system beyond comprehension if N exceeds about six . 
14014	br-g20	3	22	293181	The crowd consequently breaks_up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes . 
14015	br-g20	4	23	293209	For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a_few honored newcomers , then the `` open_house '' system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door . 
14016	br-g20	5	24	293260	We consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land_sites necessary for family subsistence . 
14017	br-g20	5	25	293289	We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most_of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in Figure 2 . 
14018	br-g20	5	26	293333	Information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second - , third - , and fourth hand as a distortable rumor . 
14019	br-g20	5	27	293353	In Figure 2 , the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number . 
14020	br-g20	5	28	293372	The numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors . 
14021	br-g20	5	29	293381	It will be noted that point f has seven nearest neighbors , h and e have six , and p has only one , while the remaining points have intermediate numbers . 
14022	br-g20	5	30	293413	In any social_system in which communications have an importance comparable_with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in Figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens . 
14023	br-g20	5	31	293466	A point like p gets information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n . 
14024	br-g20	5	32	293487	The dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure , the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting_over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort . 
14025	br-g20	5	33	293544	Since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such_as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar_maple camp . 
14026	br-g20	5	34	293588	Location theorists have given these matters much consideration . 
14027	br-g20	6	35	293597	The networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not_only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war . 
14028	br-g20	6	36	293634	They also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored . 
14029	br-g20	6	37	293650	Without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party . 
14030	br-g20	6	38	293661	The need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling . 
14031	br-g20	6	39	293675	Alexander_the_Great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at_once . 
14032	br-g20	6	40	293708	As time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military_vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased . 
14033	br-g20	6	41	293755	Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision_making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value . 
14034	br-g20	7	42	293781	On the parade_ground the net may be similar to that shown in Figure 3 . 
14035	br-g20	7	43	293796	The monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence . 
14036	br-g20	7	44	293810	No questions , statements , or explanations are permitted - only commands . 
14037	br-g20	7	45	293823	Commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower_rank . 
14038	br-g20	7	46	293836	The same command is repeated as_many times as there are levels in rank from general to corporal . 
14039	br-g20	7	47	293854	All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks . 
14040	br-g20	7	48	293874	Even the officer in_charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrained by monitoring . 
14041	br-g20	7	49	293897	This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility . 
14042	br-g20	7	50	293919	The commands are specified by the military regulations ; are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound ; and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade_ground . 
14043	br-g20	7	51	293959	This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade_ground , everyone can hear too_much , and without monitoring a confused social_event would develop . 
14044	br-g20	8	52	293983	With troops dispersed on fields_of_battle rather than on the parade_ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication . 
14045	br-g20	8	53	294012	Years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too_much is heard . 
14046	br-g20	9	54	294047	In contrast to cocktail_parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal . 
14047	br-g20	9	55	294064	In the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in Figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior . 
14048	br-g20	9	56	294087	A military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command . 
14049	br-g20	9	57	294099	This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action . 
14050	br-g20	9	58	294111	The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting_as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village . 
14051	br-g20	10	59	294160	The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( a ) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too_much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. . 
14052	br-g20	10	60	294204	( b ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times . 
14053	br-g20	10	61	294230	( c ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command . 
14054	br-g20	10	62	294245	And ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower_rank . 
14055	br-g20	10	63	294270	These assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and_so_on until there are six levels of personnel . 
14056	br-g20	10	64	294303	The number of people acting_as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of * * f 55987 men . 
14057	br-g20	11	65	294325	This organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent . 
14058	br-g20	11	66	294346	Of types of message listed in Table 1 , commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in Figure 3 . 
14059	br-g20	11	67	294372	A further regulation is that commands always go_down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go_up , unaccompanied by commands . 
14060	br-g20	11	68	294394	Questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor . 
14061	br-g20	12	69	294422	It will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in_vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice . 
14062	br-g20	12	70	294457	Furthermore , the network in Figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the_like are interlaced . 
14063	br-g20	13	71	294481	Not discussed here are some military problems of modern_times such_as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision_making are not the bottlenecks . 
14064	br-g20	13	72	294517	Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain_forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach . 
14065	br-g20	14	73	294558	This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry . 
14066	br-g20	14	74	294608	We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes . 
14067	br-g20	14	75	294639	This problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis . 
14068	br-g20	14	76	294662	Since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it . 
14069	br-g20	15	77	294678	First , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist . 
14070	br-g20	15	78	294690	But , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such . 
14071	br-g20	15	79	294706	For_example , there are persons who are in physical_science , in the field of mineralogy , trained in crystallography , who use only X-rays , applying only the powder_technique of X-ray_diffraction , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating_on the montmorillonites ; or persons in the social_sciences in the field of anthropology , studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians . 
14072	br-g20	15	80	294775	So we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops , as contrasted to the generalist , who knows less and less about more and more . 
14073	br-g21	1	1	294813	American democratic thought , pointed_up the relation between the Protestant movement in_this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the American Democratic Faith . 
14074	br-g21	1	2	294842	Those familiar_with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 . 
14075	br-g21	1	3	294861	And he describes it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental_law . 
14076	br-g21	2	4	294883	I want to say more about Gabriel 's so-called fundamental_law . 
14077	br-g21	2	5	294894	But first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in_this country and what happened to it . 
14078	br-g21	2	6	294919	He points_out that from the time of Jackson on through World_War_1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America . 
14079	br-g21	2	7	294947	He terms this early enthusiasm `` Romantic_Christianity '' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of_that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical Protestantism '' . 
14080	br-g21	2	8	294987	Let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme . 
14081	br-g21	3	9	295004	He says : `` Beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the United_States to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy '' . 
14082	br-g21	3	10	295063	He specifies , `` In the middle period of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism , in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism . 
14083	br-g21	3	11	295092	But in every period it has been humanism '' . 
14084	br-g21	3	12	295102	And let me add , utopianism , also . 
14085	br-g21	4	13	295111	Some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay I called The Leader_Follows - Where ? 
14086	br-g21	4	14	295128	I used his polarity to illustrate what I thought had happened to us in_that form of liberalism we call Progressivism . 
14087	br-g21	4	15	295149	It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental_law in the common_man . 
14088	br-g21	4	16	295172	That_is_to_say Gabriel 's fundamental_law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any_more . 
14089	br-g21	4	17	295193	It is a weakness of Gabriel 's analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental_law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy . 
14090	br-g21	4	18	295226	And with Progressivism the Religion_of_Humanity was replacing what Gabriel called Christian supernaturalism . 
14091	br-g21	4	19	295239	And the common_man was developing mythic power , or charisma , on_his_own . 
14092	br-g21	5	20	295252	During the decade that followed , the common_man , as that piece put it , grew uncomfortable as the Voice of God and fled from behind Saint_Woodrow_(_Wilson ) only to learn from Science , to his shocked relief that after_all there was no God he had to speak_for and that he was just an animal anyhow - that there was a chemical_formula for him , and that too much could n't be expected of him . 
14093	br-g21	6	21	295328	The socialism implicit_in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the First_Amendment to the Constitution , or of the Jacksonian frontier . 
14094	br-g21	6	22	295364	What had happened to the common_man ? 
14095	br-g21	7	23	295371	French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in_this country before the days of Popularism . 
14096	br-g21	7	24	295386	The riotous onrush of industrialism after the War_for_Southern_Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion_of_Humanity , however , prepared the way for a reception of the French_Revolution 's socialistic offspring of one sort of another . 
14097	br-g21	7	25	295423	The first of_which to find important place in our federal_government was the graduated income_tax under Wilson . 
14098	br-g21	7	26	295440	Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920 s , the dislocations of the Depression , the common ethos of Materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike_Fink and the Great_Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the Little_People . 
14099	br-g21	8	27	295486	However , it is important to trace the philosophy of the French_Revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former . 
14100	br-g21	8	28	295521	That John_Locke 's philosophy of the social_contract fathered the American_Revolution with its Declaration_of_Independence , I believe , we generally accept . 
14101	br-g21	8	29	295542	Yet , after Rousseau had given the social_contract a new twist with his notion of the General Will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the French_Revolution also . 
14102	br-g21	9	30	295579	The importance of Rousseau 's twist has not always been clear to us , however . 
14103	br-g21	9	31	295595	This notion of the General Will gave_rise to the Commune_of_Paris in the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship . 
14104	br-g21	9	32	295615	And it is clearly argued by Lord_Percy of Newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , The Heresy_of_Democracy , and in a more general way by Voegelin , in his New_Science_of_Politics , that this same Rousseauan idea , descending through European democracy , is the source of Marx 's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat . 
14105	br-g21	9	33	295672	This is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World_War_2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace . 
14106	br-g21	10	34	295698	The long road that had taken liberals in_this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State . 
14107	br-g21	10	35	295735	And the USSR existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . 
14108	br-g21	10	36	295751	And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in_this country was spiritually Marxist . 
14109	br-g21	11	37	295767	We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San_Francisco to set_up the legal framework , finally and at_last , to rationalize war - to rationalize want and fear - out of the world : the United_Nations . 
14110	br-g21	11	38	295814	We of the liberal led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation . 
14111	br-g21	11	39	295828	Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally . 
14112	br-g21	12	40	295863	During the next five years the leaders of the Fair_Deal reluctantly backed_down from the optimistic expectations of the New_Deal . 
14113	br-g21	12	41	295883	During the next five years liberal leaders in the United_States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment - and the bitterest irony - enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : 
14114	br-g21	12	42	295935	the atom_bomb . 
14115	br-g21	12	43	295938	In 1952 , it will be remembered , the G._O._P. without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly . 
14116	br-g21	13	44	295963	All_of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you . 
14117	br-g21	13	45	295976	But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common_man , to point_up what happened to him under Eisenhower 's leadership . 
14118	br-g21	14	46	296004	A perceptive journalist , Sam_Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as The Revolt Of The Moderates . 
14119	br-g21	14	47	296028	He opens his discourse , however , with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age . 
14120	br-g21	14	48	296066	The show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny . 
14121	br-g21	15	49	296093	Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue . 
14122	br-g21	15	50	296107	And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation : `` In_essence the drama of his ( Eisenhower 's ) Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling - thus_far with but limited and precarious success - to give effective voice and force to_that conservatism '' . 
14123	br-g21	16	51	296160	I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism . 
14124	br-g21	16	52	296183	It has moved_on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused . 
14125	br-g21	16	53	296196	Obviously there has been no agreement on what American conservatism is , or rather , what it should be . 
14126	br-g21	16	54	296216	For it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began . 
14127	br-g21	16	55	296231	I saw a piece the other day assailing William_Buckley , author of Man_And_God_At_Yale and publisher of the National_Review , as no conservative at_all , but an old liberal . 
14128	br-g21	16	56	296260	I would agree with this view . 
14129	br-g21	16	57	296267	But I 'm not here to define conservatism . 
14130	br-g21	17	58	296276	What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle - a struggle that amounts to self redefinition - to see if we can predict its future course . 
14131	br-g21	18	59	296310	One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election , I suppose , is that we , the majority , were dissatisfied with Eisenhower conservatism . 
14132	br-g21	18	60	296342	Though , to_be_sure , we gave Kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment . 
14133	br-g21	19	61	296360	This is , however , symptomatic_of our national malaise . 
14134	br-g21	19	62	296370	But before I try to diagnose it , I would offer other evidence . 
14135	br-g21	19	63	296384	I will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year . 
14136	br-g21	19	64	296400	The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by Life magazine , under the title of the National purpose . 
14137	br-g21	19	65	296422	The contributors to this testament were all well-known : 
14138	br-g21	19	66	296431	a former Democratic candidate for President , a New_Deal poet , the magazine 's chief editorial writer , two newspaper_columnists , head of a national broadcasting_company , a popular Protestant evangelist , etc. . 
14139	br-g21	19	67	296465	What I want to point_out here is that all_of them are ex liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception . 
14140	br-g21	19	68	296488	I suppose we might classify Billy_Graham as an old liberal . 
14141	br-g21	19	69	296499	And I would further note that they all - with one exception again - sang in one key or another the same song . 
14142	br-g21	19	70	296523	Its refrain was : `` Let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation '' . 
14143	br-g21	20	71	296543	Adlai_Stevenson expressed some reservations about this return . 
14144	br-g21	20	72	296551	Others invoked technology and common_sense . 
14145	br-g21	20	73	296557	Only Walter_Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most_of what we used_to regard_as the program of our national purposes '' . 
14146	br-g21	21	74	296580	But the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent . 
14147	br-g21	22	75	296603	The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower 's Commission_on_National_Goals , titled Goals_For_Americans . 
14148	br-g21	22	76	296618	They , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested that the Commission be administered by the American_Assembly_of_Columbia_University , because it was non-partisan . 
14149	br-g21	22	77	296652	The Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of_what I would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism . 
14150	br-g21	22	78	296681	And here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above : `` The paramount goal of the United_States , set long_ago , was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity '' . 
14151	br-g21	22	79	296721	This group is secularist and their program tends to be technological . 
14152	br-g21	23	80	296733	But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common_man 's malaise . 
14153	br-g21	23	81	296755	And let me add Murray 's new book as another symptom of_it , particularly so in_view_of the attention Time magazine gave it when it came_out recently . 
14154	br-g21	23	82	296782	Father_Murray goes_back to the Declaration_of_Independence , too , though I may add , with considerably more historical perception . 
14155	br-g21	24	83	296801	I will reserve discussion of_it for a moment , however , to return to President_Kennedy . 
14156	br-g21	24	84	296817	As symptomatic_of the common_man 's malaise , he is most significant : a liberal and a Catholic , elected by the skin_of_his_teeth . 
14157	br-g21	24	85	296840	Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ? 
14158	br-g21	25	86	296862	What is the common_man 's complaint ? 
14159	br-g21	25	87	296869	Let 's take a panoramic look back over the course we have come . 
14160	br-g21	25	88	296883	Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under Eisenhower ? 
14161	br-g21	25	89	296903	And the basic character of_that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic . 
14162	br-g21	25	90	296916	Ralph_Gabriel gave it the name of Protestant philosophy of Progress . 
14163	br-g21	25	91	296927	But there 's a subjective side to_that utopian outlook . 
14164	br-g22	1	1	296937	Does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? 
14165	br-g22	1	2	296961	Here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only_when related_to the more normal rate of healthy growth . 
14166	br-g22	1	3	296991	Should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? 
14167	br-g22	1	4	297001	Noting such evidence is the first_step ; and almost the only `` cure '' is early detection and removal . 
14168	br-g22	1	5	297021	One way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society 's organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before . 
14169	br-g22	1	6	297054	So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation . 
14170	br-g22	1	7	297073	In_any_event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease '' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical . 
14171	br-g22	1	8	297107	Have not our physical_abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ? 
14172	br-g22	1	9	297124	Hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature . 
14173	br-g22	2	10	297171	We are already committed to establishing man 's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social political economical context we are fond of today . 
14174	br-g22	2	11	297202	Otherwise , we go_on endlessly trying to draw_the_line , color and other , as to which kind_of man we wish to see dominate . 
14175	br-g22	2	12	297226	We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else . 
14176	br-g22	2	13	297258	We must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? 
14177	br-g22	2	14	297276	So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other men . 
14178	br-g22	2	15	297311	Naturally this includes all communication forms , e._g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control . 
14179	br-g22	2	16	297336	Properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution . 
14180	br-g22	3	17	297360	If we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man ; best growth . 
14181	br-g22	3	18	297391	But we cannot start off with a clean_slate . 
14182	br-g22	3	19	297400	So we must first analyze our present institutions with_respect_to the effect of each on man 's major needs . 
14183	br-g22	3	20	297419	Asked which institution most needs correction , I would say the corporation as it exists in America today . 
14184	br-g22	3	21	297438	At_first_glance this appears strange : of all people , was not America founded by rugged_individualists who established a new way_of_life still inspiring `` undeveloped '' societies abroad ? 
14185	br-g22	3	22	297466	But hear Harrison_E._Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The_New_York_Times , and author of `` To_Moscow_-_And_Beyond '' . 
14186	br-g22	3	23	297483	In a book review of `` The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State_Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West_Contacts_Staff in_order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy_and_Bess ' overrode the State_Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . 
14187	br-g22	3	24	297556	They were not diplomats or jazz_musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo_montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry_Ford , Hugh_Cooper , Thomas_Campbell , the International_Harvester_Co. , and David_W._Griffith . 
14188	br-g22	3	25	297589	Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . 
14189	br-g22	3	26	297644	This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti American propaganda '' . 
14190	br-g22	4	27	297669	Perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no_more exists in America . 
14191	br-g22	4	28	297693	In his stead is a milquetoast version known_as `` the corporation '' . 
14192	br-g22	4	29	297706	But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad is the direct result . 
14193	br-g22	4	30	297738	No amount of ballyhoo will cover_up the sordid facts . 
14194	br-g22	4	31	297748	If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it . 
14195	br-g22	4	32	297764	First , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per_se cannot take economic leadership . 
14196	br-g22	4	33	297788	Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind . 
14197	br-g22	4	34	297813	When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . 
14198	br-g22	4	35	297852	The biggest loss , of_course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . 
14199	br-g22	4	36	297880	Socialism , I grant , has a definite place in our society . 
14200	br-g22	4	37	297893	But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic . 
14201	br-g22	4	38	297914	Some forms of capitalism do indeed work - superb organizations , a credit to any society . 
14202	br-g22	4	39	297931	But the pseudo capitalism which dictates our whole economy as_well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny . 
14203	br-g22	4	40	297954	Its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham . 
14204	br-g22	4	41	297969	It serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that . 
14205	br-g22	4	42	297980	As a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` swallowing '' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) . 
14206	br-g22	4	43	298013	As to benefits to employees , it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends_on them for services . 
14207	br-g22	5	44	298034	The corporation in America is in_reality our form of socialism , vying in_a_sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy . 
14208	br-g22	5	45	298059	But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status_quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as_a_whole . 
14209	br-g22	5	46	298119	So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard_to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation 's needs for survival . 
14210	br-g22	6	47	298162	The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society . 
14211	br-g22	6	48	298174	Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society . 
14212	br-g22	6	49	298215	Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by_any_means other_than the corporate form , e._g. constructing major airports or dams . 
14213	br-g22	6	50	298261	Thus , if corporations are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject_to public control and needs . 
14214	br-g22	6	51	298285	In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services . 
14215	br-g22	7	52	298309	Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human_beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests . 
14216	br-g22	7	53	298340	Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot . 
14217	br-g22	7	54	298352	It can project long-range goals for itself . 
14218	br-g22	7	55	298360	Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e._g. , quarterly and annual dividend reports . 
14219	br-g22	7	56	298375	Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; corporations , being more amorphous , cannot . 
14220	br-g22	7	57	298393	Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community . 
14221	br-g22	7	58	298415	Corporations are apt by_nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public . 
14222	br-g22	7	59	298444	The proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board_of_directors and stockholders . 
14223	br-g22	7	60	298463	Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop . 
14224	br-g22	7	61	298478	Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now . 
14225	br-g22	8	62	298519	Hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest . 
14226	br-g22	8	63	298541	Proprietorships should get the tax_advantages now accruing to corporations , e._g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth . 
14227	br-g22	8	64	298562	Corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) . 
14228	br-g22	8	65	298583	The right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated . 
14229	br-g22	8	66	298596	To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming_to_the_fore , and is basically anti democratic . 
14230	br-g22	8	67	298627	When the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it . 
14231	br-g22	8	68	298654	Strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting_as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole . 
14232	br-g22	8	69	298706	Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship . 
14233	br-g22	8	70	298723	Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so . 
14234	br-g22	8	71	298740	If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic_system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? 
14235	br-g22	9	72	298759	These proposals would go_far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in_turn , would help us to cope_with runaway technology . 
14236	br-g22	9	73	298786	Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition . 
14237	br-g22	9	74	298798	The battle is not easy . 
14238	br-g22	9	75	298804	We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of_our_own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders . 
14239	br-g22	9	76	298846	Persons developed in to-day 's corporations cannot hope to serve here - a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside . 
14240	br-g22	9	77	298873	In my own company , in_effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , I have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal '' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do . 
14241	br-g22	9	78	298915	Also , I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow employees . 
14242	br-g22	9	79	298950	Any abilities I may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing_in the growth and control of my business , coupled with raising my family . 
14243	br-g22	9	80	298979	This combined experience , on a foundation of very average , I assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against . 
14244	br-g22	9	81	299011	Perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here . 
14245	br-g22	10	82	299028	The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles . 
14246	br-g22	10	83	299064	From an initial investment of $ 1200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $ 10000000 ( we do n't disclose financial figures to the public ) . 
14247	br-g22	10	84	299107	Its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ; and no limitation is in_evidence . 
14248	br-g22	10	85	299124	Our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a_few years time , despite substantial , well established competition . 
14249	br-g23	1	1	299145	During the last years of Woodrow_Wilson 's administration , a red_scare developed in our country . 
14250	br-g23	1	2	299161	Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned_to the repression of ideas by force . 
14251	br-g23	1	3	299179	Postmaster_General Burleson set_about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails . 
14252	br-g23	1	4	299198	Attorney_General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more_than 4000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights . 
14253	br-g23	1	5	299223	Then , not many years later , the Un-American_Activities_Committee , under the leadership of Martin_Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens . 
14254	br-g23	1	6	299247	Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government . 
14255	br-g23	1	7	299279	This hysteria reached its height under the leadership of Senator_Joseph_McCarthy . 
14256	br-g23	1	8	299290	Demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions . 
14257	br-g23	1	9	299310	New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no_matter_how . 
14258	br-g23	2	10	299321	Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency . 
14259	br-g23	2	11	299334	They give strict interpretation to William_James ' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself '' . 
14260	br-g23	2	12	299356	They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as_soon_as he contacts something new . 
14261	br-g23	2	13	299372	Hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe . 
14262	br-g23	3	14	299396	Despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools ; they are priceless even_though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page ; they are the most valuable of commodities - and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply . 
14263	br-g23	3	15	299452	So all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall_into two classes : those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others . 
14264	br-g23	4	16	299497	Seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will keep the sheriff away '' . 
14265	br-g23	4	17	299529	That , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval . 
14266	br-g23	4	18	299549	Criminals , as_well_as model citizens , exercise their minds . 
14267	br-g23	4	19	299559	Merely having a mental_image of some sort is not the all-important consideration . 
14268	br-g23	5	20	299572	Of_course , there must be clarity : a single distinct impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones . 
14269	br-g23	5	21	299591	But clarity is not enough . 
14270	br-g23	5	22	299597	The writer took a class of college_students to the state hospital for the mentally_ill in St._Joseph , Missouri . 
14271	br-g23	5	23	299616	An inmate , a former university professor , expounded to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfering his thoughts . 
14272	br-g23	5	24	299639	He appealed_to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done . 
14273	br-g23	5	25	299658	Despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea was not of Einsteinian calibre . 
14274	br-g23	6	26	299673	True , ideas are important , perhaps life 's most precious treasures . 
14275	br-g23	6	27	299686	But have we not gone overboard in stressing their significance ? 
14276	br-g23	6	28	299697	Have we not actually developed idea worship ? 
14277	br-g23	7	29	299705	Ideas we must have , and we seek them everywhere . 
14278	br-g23	7	30	299716	We scour literature for them ; here we find stored the wisdom of great minds . 
14279	br-g23	7	31	299732	But are all these works worthy of consideration ? 
14280	br-g23	7	32	299741	Can they stand rigid scrutiny ? 
14281	br-g23	8	33	299747	Shakespeare 's wit and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stood the test of centuries . 
14282	br-g23	8	34	299767	But was he infallible in all things ? 
14283	br-g23	8	35	299775	What of his treatment of the Jew in The_Merchant_of_Venice ? 
14284	br-g23	9	36	299785	Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock , but probably he never saw a Jew , unless in some of his travels . 
14285	br-g23	9	37	299809	The Jews had been banished from England in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years . 
14286	br-g23	9	38	299836	If any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place . 
14287	br-g23	10	39	299852	Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of life . 
14288	br-g23	10	40	299889	Rather than from a first-hand study of Jewish people , his delineation of Shylock stems from a collection of Italian stories , Il_Pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier . 
14289	br-g23	10	41	299924	He could learn at second_hand from books , but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit . 
14290	br-g23	10	42	299942	Harris_J._Griston , in Shaking_The_Dust_From_Shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes : `` There is not a word spoken by Shylock which one would expect from a real Jew '' . 
14291	br-g23	11	43	299971	He took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone . 
14292	br-g23	11	44	299988	The Jew was the safest victim . 
14293	br-g23	11	45	299995	No Jew was on_hand to boycott his financially struggling theater . 
14294	br-g23	11	46	300006	It would have been unwise policy , for_instance , to apply the pound of flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman . 
14295	br-g23	11	47	300027	Just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of Mars , or even of Tikopia , and no senatorial investigation will result . 
14296	br-g23	11	48	300052	Who cares about them ! 
14297	br-g23	12	49	300057	Shakespeare does not tell us that Shylock was an aberrant individual . 
14298	br-g23	12	50	300069	He sets him forth as being typical of the group . 
14299	br-g23	12	51	300080	He tells of his `` Jewish heart '' - not a Shylockian heart ; but a Jewish heart . 
14300	br-g23	12	52	300099	This would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge . 
14301	br-g23	13	53	300112	There is no justification for such misrepresentation . 
14302	br-g23	13	54	300120	If living Jews were unavailable for study , the Bible was at_hand . 
14303	br-g23	13	55	300133	Reading the Old_Testament would have shown the dramatist that the ideas attributed to Shylock were abhorrent to the Jews . 
14304	br-g23	14	56	300153	Are we better_off for having Shakespeare 's idea of Shylock ? 
14305	br-g23	14	57	300164	Studying The_Merchant_of_Venice in high_school and college has given many young people their notions about Jews . 
14306	br-g23	14	58	300180	Does this help the non-Jew to understand this group ? 
14307	br-g23	15	59	300190	Thomas_de_Torquemada , Inquisitor-General of the Spanish_Inquisition , put many persons to death . 
14308	br-g23	15	60	300203	His name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty . 
14309	br-g23	15	61	300211	Would we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today 's Roman_Catholics by saying he had a Catholic heart ? 
14310	br-g23	15	62	300232	Let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong ; he is out_of_place in our times . 
14311	br-g23	15	63	300254	Shakespeare 's Shylock , too , is of dubious value in the modern_world . 
14312	br-g23	16	64	300268	Ideas , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good . 
14313	br-g23	16	65	300282	A successful businessman recently prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where they and their theories might rot together . 
14314	br-g23	16	66	300318	Will his words come to be treasured and quoted through the years ? 
14315	br-g23	17	67	300331	Frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in_the_end only the good ones will survive . 
14316	br-g23	17	68	300354	But is that not like going_to a chemistry_laboratory and blindly pouring_out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder_drug inevitably to result ? 
14317	br-g23	18	69	300387	What of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? 
14318	br-g23	18	70	300399	Is there some magic in it that assures results ? 
14319	br-g23	19	71	300409	When Peter_B._Kyne ( Pride_of_Palomar , 43 ) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the Japanese , did the heated debates of the Californians settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ? 
14320	br-g23	20	72	300446	The Leopard 's_Spots came from the pen of Thomas_Dixon in 1902 , and in_this he announced an `` unchangeable '' law . 
14321	br-g23	20	73	300468	If a child had a single drop of Negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3000 years . 
14322	br-g23	20	74	300507	That doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ? 
14323	br-g23	21	75	300522	In the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked . 
14324	br-g23	21	76	300535	The son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger_nails . 
14325	br-g23	21	77	300557	In_time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child . 
14326	br-g23	21	78	300568	Is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? 
14327	br-g23	21	79	300580	Will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ? 
14328	br-g23	22	80	300590	For answers to such questions we must turn_to the anthropologists , the biologists , the historians , the psychologists , and the sociologists . 
14329	br-g23	22	81	300614	Long_ago they consigned the notions of Kyne and Dixon to the scrap_heap . 
14330	br-g23	23	82	300627	False ideas surfeit another sector of our life . 
14331	br-g23	23	83	300636	For several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship . 
14332	br-g23	23	84	300648	The stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress . 
14333	br-g23	23	85	300663	Children , conditioned by this mistaken notion , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one . 
14334	br-g23	23	86	300695	Debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one . 
14335	br-g23	23	87	300714	Research , on_the_other_hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers . 
14336	br-g23	24	88	300735	Helen_Deutsch informed us ( The_Psychology_of_Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many . 
14337	br-g23	24	89	300769	Will mere debate on that proposition , even_though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? 
14338	br-g23	24	90	300794	That is questionable , to say the least . 
14339	br-g23	24	91	300803	Research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one . 
14340	br-g23	25	92	300817	Most assuredly ideas are invaluable . 
14341	br-g23	25	93	300823	But ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough . 
14342	br-g23	25	94	300838	In the 1930 's , cures for the depression literally flooded Washington . 
14343	br-g23	25	95	300851	For a time the President received hundreds of them every_day , most_of them worthless . 
14344	br-g23	26	96	300866	Ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate . 
14345	br-g23	26	97	300880	When some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for_instance , we do not turn_to free and open discussion as in a political_campaign . 
14346	br-g23	26	98	300906	We have recourse to the scientifically trained specialist in the laboratory . 
14347	br-g23	26	99	300918	The merits of the Salk anti polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children . 
14348	br-g23	27	100	300953	Our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument . 
14349	br-g23	27	101	300962	But is the result new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with_confidence solve our domestic and international problems ? 
14350	br-g23	27	102	300986	Man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad . 
14351	br-g23	27	103	301005	But what a super Herculean task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud_beplastered arguments used so freely , particularly since such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes , in themselves declarations of intellectual bankruptcy . 
14352	br-g23	28	104	301045	We are reminded , however , that freedom_of_thought and discussion , the unfettered exchange of ideas , is basic under our form_of_government . 
14353	br-g23	29	105	301068	Assuredly in our political_campaigns there is freedom to think , to examine any and all issues , and to speak without restraint . 
14354	br-g23	29	106	301091	No_holds_are_barred . 
14355	br-g23	29	107	301093	But have the results been heartening ? 
14356	br-g23	29	108	301100	May we state with_confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security ? 
14357	br-g23	30	109	301117	We must_not forget , to_be_sure , that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results . 
14358	br-g23	30	110	301133	In_truth , we can say that this broke the power of Senator_Joseph_McCarthy , who was finally exposed in full light to the American people . 
14359	br-g23	30	111	301158	If he had been `` liquidated '' in_some_way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying_point for people who shared his ideas . 
14360	br-g23	30	112	301183	Debate in the political_arena can be productive of good . 
14361	br-g23	30	113	301193	But it is a clumsy and wasteful process : it can produce negative results but not much that is positive . 
14362	br-g23	30	114	301214	Debate rid us of McCarthy but did not give us much that is positive . 
14363	br-g23	30	115	301229	It did something to clear the ground , but it erected no striking new structure ; it did not even provide the architect 's plan for anything new . 
14364	br-g23	31	116	301258	In the field of the natural_sciences , scientifically verified data are quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good results . 
14365	br-g23	31	117	301282	In the field of the social_sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage . 
14366	br-g23	32	118	301305	By_no_means would we discourage the production of ideas : they provide raw_materials with which to work ; they provide stimulations that lead to further production . 
14367	br-g23	32	119	301331	We would establish no censorship . 
14368	br-g28	1	1	301337	Important as was Mr._O'_Donnell 's essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has . 
14369	br-g28	1	2	301360	He and also Mr._Cowley and Mr._Warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many_of us to read into our authors - Nathaniel_Hawthorne , for_example , and Herman_Melville - protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs . 
14370	br-g28	1	3	301411	Faulkner 's total works today , and in_fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when Mr._Cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when Mr._O'_Donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the South . 
14371	br-g28	1	4	301452	If he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist . 
14372	br-g28	1	5	301464	If he condemns the recent or the present , he condemns the past with no less force . 
14373	br-g28	1	6	301482	If he sees the heroic in a Sartoris or a Sutpen , he sees also - and he shows - the blind and the mean , and he sees the Compson family disintegrating from within . 
14374	br-g28	1	7	301518	If the barn-burner 's family produces a Flem_Snopes , who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness , the Compson family produces a Jason_Compson 4 , . 
14375	br-g28	1	8	301545	Faulkner is a most untraditional traditionalist . 
14376	br-g28	2	9	301552	Others writing_on Faulkner have found the phrase `` traditional moralist '' either inadequate or misleading . 
14377	br-g28	2	10	301568	Among them are Frederick_J._Hoffman , William_Van_O'Connor , and Mrs._Olga_Vickery . 
14378	br-g28	2	11	301578	They have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , I believe , in pointing_out Faulkner 's independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the Southern tradition . 
14379	br-g28	2	12	301610	Faulkner 's is not the mind of the apologist which Mr._O'_Donnell implies that it is . 
14380	br-g28	2	13	301626	He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions - or possibly the regulations - governing his tenure in the post_office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago . 
14381	br-g28	3	14	301674	That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of_course , that he is steeped in them , in_fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books . 
14382	br-g28	3	15	301710	It is to say rather , I believe , that he has brought_to_bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind - the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique . 
14383	br-g28	3	16	301759	He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern . 
14384	br-g28	3	17	301778	The fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern , I rather think , for the South has been no_more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity . 
14385	br-g28	3	18	301837	Some of us might be inclined to argue , in_fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly Southern traits . 
14386	br-g28	4	19	301871	There is no necessity , I suppose , to assert that Mr._Faulkner is Southern . 
14387	br-g28	4	20	301886	It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his family . 
14388	br-g28	4	21	301904	And , after_all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford , Mississippi , and Charlottesville , Virginia . 
14389	br-g28	4	22	301923	The young William_Faulkner in New_Orleans in the 1920 's impressed the novelist Hamilton_Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so . 
14390	br-g28	4	23	301961	Besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in_addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years . 
14391	br-g28	5	24	302017	It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge . 
14392	br-g28	5	25	302042	His own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the South , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation . 
14393	br-g28	5	26	302087	His denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no_doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written_about the South . 
14394	br-g28	5	27	302134	To believe otherwise would be unrealistic . 
14395	br-g28	6	28	302141	But in looking_at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South , it is important not to lose the broader perspective . 
14396	br-g28	6	29	302164	His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers . 
14397	br-g28	6	30	302176	Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic_romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry_James and James_Joyce among them . 
14398	br-g28	6	31	302223	His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . 
14399	br-g28	6	32	302261	My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked_at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . 
14400	br-g28	7	33	302303	The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problems he takes_up have had the attention of authors before him . 
14401	br-g28	7	34	302332	A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region . 
14402	br-g28	8	35	302381	The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at_least since John_Pendleton_Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank_Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature . 
14403	br-g28	8	36	302416	The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil_War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way_of_life which had been destroyed . 
14404	br-g28	8	37	302447	As they looked with_nostalgia to a society which had been swept_away , they were probably no_more than half conscious that they painted_in_colors which had never existed . 
14405	br-g28	8	38	302474	Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp . 
14406	br-g28	8	39	302497	The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas_Nelson_Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So_Red_the_Rose , by Stark_Young . 
14407	br-g28	8	40	302533	Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark_Young 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . 
14408	br-g28	9	41	302561	The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis_Pendleton_Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . 
14409	br-g28	9	42	302602	Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . 
14410	br-g28	9	43	302623	Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner 's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil_War . 
14411	br-g28	9	44	302673	It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen_Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society . 
14412	br-g28	10	45	302729	Faulkner 's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life . 
14413	br-g28	10	46	302746	They have an ancestry extending back , however , at_least to 1728 , when William_Byrd described the Lubberlanders he encountered in the back_country of Virginia and North_Carolina . 
14414	br-g28	10	47	302774	The chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated_in the South and the Southwest in the three decades before the Civil_War . 
14415	br-g28	10	48	302804	These narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters ' libraries beside the morocco bound volumes of Horace , Mr._Addison , Mr._Pope , and Sir_Walter_Scott . 
14416	br-g28	10	49	302853	There is evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . 
14417	br-g28	10	50	302904	William_Gilmore_Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such_as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . 
14418	br-g28	10	51	302937	Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . 
14419	br-g28	10	52	302963	Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy_Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him . 
14420	br-g28	11	53	303023	Others who wrote_of low characters and low life included Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , creator of the Big_Bear of Arkansas and Tom_Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; Johnson_Jones_Hooper , whose character Simon_Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem_Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried_out his will ; and George_Washington_Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut_Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . 
14421	br-g28	11	54	303103	It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a_hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time . 
14422	br-g28	11	55	303168	Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long established literary precedent . 
14423	br-g28	11	56	303198	Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters . 
14424	br-g28	12	57	303279	One of the early humorists already mentioned , Thomas_Bangs_Thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials . 
14425	br-g28	12	58	303311	Thorpe came to Louisiana from the East as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty . 
14426	br-g28	12	59	303338	But Thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier_settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions . 
14427	br-g28	12	60	303366	As a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on_the_one_hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on_the_other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble , Arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano ; and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` The_Big_Bear_of_Arkansas '' , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature . 
14428	br-g31	1	1	303451	Henrietta 's feeling_of_identity with Sara_Sullam was crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that Sara 's epitaph in the Jewish cemetery in Venice referred to her as `` the Sulamite '' . 
14429	br-g31	2	2	303483	Into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama Henrietta , as every artist delights to do , wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and - especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair - into the relations of men and women : `` In their relations , she was the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander . 
14430	br-g31	2	3	303562	His feeling always exacted sacrifices from her . 
14431	br-g31	2	4	303570	One is so accustomed to think_of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we condemn the woman as a coquette . 
14432	br-g31	2	5	303621	The very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts ; usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived_notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly . 
14433	br-g31	2	6	303677	She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man . 
14434	br-g31	2	7	303698	Women themselves have come to look_upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld . 
14435	br-g31	2	8	303736	She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done . 
14436	br-g31	2	9	303755	One who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger . 
14437	br-g31	2	10	303781	In any case but the last , such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual ; the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining . 
14438	br-g31	2	11	303815	And , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature '' . 
14439	br-g31	3	12	303834	Henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition . 
14440	br-g31	4	13	303876	Dr._Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of Sara_Sullam that he considered submitting it to the Century_Magazine or Harper 's but he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in The_Messenger , `` so our readers will be benefited instead '' . 
14441	br-g31	4	14	303928	Under her father 's influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might write_on subjects outside the Jewish field , but she did begin writing for other Anglo_Jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience . 
14442	br-g31	4	15	303967	And she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas_Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival which came in December . 
14443	br-g31	4	16	303990	By her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma gave her a Life_of_Dickens as a spur to her aspiration . 
14444	br-g31	5	17	304016	Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of Johns_Hopkins_University within walking distance of home . 
14445	br-g31	5	18	304039	It was established in a_couple_of buildings in the shopping district , with only a_few professors , but all eminent men , and a_few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings . 
14446	br-g31	5	19	304070	In September ' 76 Thomas_Huxley , Darwin 's famous disciple , came from England to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the University ; and although it was a school for men only , it afforded Henrietta an opportunity to attend its public_lectures . 
14447	br-g31	6	20	304118	In the following year her father undertook to give a course in Hebrew theology to Johns_Hopkins students , and this brought to the Szold house a group of bright young Jews who had come to Baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained by Henrietta and Rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting_room on Sunday evenings . 
14448	br-g31	6	21	304187	From Philadelphia came Cyrus_Adler and Joseph_Jastrow . 
14449	br-g31	6	22	304194	Adler , Judge_Sulzberger 's nephew , came to study Assyriology . 
14450	br-g31	6	23	304205	A smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people , he was bound to go_far . 
14451	br-g31	6	24	304237	Joseph_Jastrow , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , Marcus_Jastrow , was a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field was psychology , and who was also a punster and a jolly tease . 
14452	br-g31	6	25	304276	His father was a good friend of Rabbi_Szold , and Joe lived with the Szolds for_a_while . 
14453	br-g31	6	26	304293	Both these youths , who greatly admired Henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring Friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine ; and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with Papa , whose mind - although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it - naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were . 
14454	br-g31	6	27	304371	Besides , Miss_Henrietta - as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back - had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; so Cyrus_Adler became interested in her friend Racie_Friedenwald , and Joe_Jastrow - the only young_man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe - fell_in_love with pretty sister Rachel . 
14455	br-g31	7	28	304445	Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe 's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just_about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi_Jastrow at Rodeph_Shalom_Temple there during its Rabbi 's absence in Europe . 
14456	br-g31	7	29	304506	Young Morris , who , while attending the University_of_Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah_Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` Sulamith '' on the Jewish reform_movement being promulgated by the Hebrew_Union_College in Cincinnati . 
14457	br-g31	7	30	304567	Unlike his younger brother , Joe , he never presumed_to address her more familiarly than as `` My dear friend '' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style . 
14458	br-g31	7	31	304602	And when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and Papa did . 
14459	br-g31	8	32	304634	One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how to handle a young_man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself . 
14460	br-g31	8	33	304654	She could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her superiority in argument over a man '' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies '' of Sara_Sullam ; and in her forthright way , Henrietta , who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think_of men as the privileged '' and `` women as submissive and yielding '' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris_Jastrow took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair , as_well_as on the radical reforms of Dr._Wise of Hebrew_Union_College - until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given_up hope they would ever agree on anything . 
14461	br-g31	8	34	304780	But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard_Street . 
14462	br-g31	9	35	304813	`` We 've got Father and Mother and each_other , '' said Beth on the first page of Louisa_Alcott 's Little_Women ; and , `` I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world '' , burst_out Jo some five_hundred pages later in that popular story of the March family , which had first appeared when Henrietta was eight ; and the Szold family , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance to the Marches . 
14463	br-g31	10	36	304895	Mr._March , like Benjamin_Szold , was a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination ; and `` Marmee '' March , like Sophie_Szold , was the competent manager of her brood of girls , of whom the Marches had only four to the Szolds ' five . 
14464	br-g31	10	37	304942	But the March girls had their counterparts in the Szold girls . 
14465	br-g31	10	38	304954	Henrietta could easily identify herself with Jo_March , although Jo was not the eldest sister . 
14466	br-g31	10	39	304970	Neither was Henrietta hoydenish like Jo , who frankly wished she were a boy and had deliberately shortened her name , which , like Henrietta 's , was the feminine form of a boy 's name . 
14467	br-g31	10	40	305007	But both were high-spirited and vivacious , both had tempers to control , both loved languages , especially English and German , both were good teachers and wrote for publication . 
14468	br-g31	10	41	305038	Each was her mother 's assistant and confidante ; and each stood_out conspicuously in the family picture . 
14469	br-g31	11	42	305056	Bertha_Szold was more like Meg , the eldest March girl , who `` learned that a woman 's happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor the art of ruling it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother '' . 
14470	br-g31	11	43	305101	Bertha , blue-eyed like Mamma , was from the start her mother 's daughter , destined for her mother 's role in life . 
14471	br-g31	11	44	305125	Sadie , like Beth_March , suffered ill_health - got rheumatic_fever and had to be careful of her heart - but that never dampened her spirits . 
14472	br-g31	11	45	305151	When her right_hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism , Sadie learned to write with her left_hand . 
14473	br-g31	11	46	305168	She wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments , like `` Oh_,_What_Fun ! 
14474	br-g31	11	47	305183	A comedy in Three Acts '' , in which , under `` Personages '' , Henrietta appeared as `` A Schoolmarm '' , and Bertha , who was only a_trifle less brilliant in high_school than Henrietta had been , appeared as `` Dummkopf '' . 
14475	br-g31	11	48	305228	Sadie studied piano ; played Chopin in the `` Soiree_Musicale of Mr._Guthrie 's Pupils '' ; and she recited `` Hector 's_Farewell_to_Andromache '' most movingly , to the special delight of Rabbi_Jastrow at his home in Germantown near Philadelphia , where the Szold girls took_turns visiting between the visits of the Jastrow boys at the Szolds ' in Baltimore . 
14476	br-g31	11	49	305288	Adele , like Amy , the youngest of the Marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one . 
14477	br-g31	11	50	305311	For Rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls - and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones - there was no particular March counterpart ; but both groups were so closely_knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content - the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian . 
14478	br-g31	12	51	305390	The Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; and , as in the March home , any young_man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them . 
14479	br-g31	12	52	305447	This included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell_in_love , just as Papa had first fallen_in_love with her Mamma before he chose her ; and when a young_man like Morris_Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma . 
14480	br-g31	12	53	305521	And just as `` Laurie '' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo_March , who found him immature by her high standards , and_then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy , so Joe_Jastrow , who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns_Hopkins , had_to content himself with her younger sister , pretty Rachel . 
14481	br-g31	12	54	305581	And like Jo_March , who saw her sisters Meg and Amy involved in `` lovering '' before herself , Henrietta saw her sisters Rachel and Sadie drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of suitors , Rachel by Joe_Jastrow , and Sadie by Max_Lobl , a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the Mississippi . 
14482	br-g39	1	1	305645	When Harold_Arlen returned to California in the winter of 1944 , it was to take_up again a collaboration with Johnny_Mercer , begun some years before . 
14483	br-g39	1	2	305671	The film they did after his return was an inconsequential bit of nothing titled Out_of_This_World , a satire on the Sinatra bobby-soxer craze . 
14484	br-g39	1	3	305695	The twist lay in using Bing_Crosby 's voice on the sound_track while leading_man Eddie_Bracken mouthed the words . 
14485	br-g39	1	4	305713	If nothing else , at_least two good songs came_out of the project , `` Out_of_This_World '' and `` June_Comes_Around_Every_Year '' . 
14486	br-g39	2	5	305734	Though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs , Arlen and Mercer were not given strong material to work_on . 
14487	br-g39	2	6	305756	Their first collaboration came close . 
14488	br-g39	2	7	305762	Early in 1941 they were assigned to a script titled Hot_Nocturne . 
14489	br-g39	2	8	305774	It purported to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz_musicians , their aims , their problems - the tug-of-war between the `` pure '' and the `` commercial '' - and seemed a promising vehicle , for the two men shared a common interest in jazz . 
14490	br-g39	3	9	305824	Johnny_Mercer practically grew_up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears . 
14491	br-g39	3	10	305839	He was_born in savannah , Georgia , in 1909 . 
14492	br-g39	3	11	305849	His father , George_A._Mercer , was descended from an honored Southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one Hugh_Mercer , who had emigrated from Scotland in 1747 . 
14493	br-g39	4	12	305879	The lyricist 's father was a lawyer who had branched_out into real_estate . 
14494	br-g39	4	13	305892	His second wife , Lillian , was the mother of John_H._Mercer . 
14495	br-g39	4	14	305904	By the age of six young Johnny indicated that he had the call . 
14496	br-g39	4	15	305918	One day he followed the_Irish_Jasper_Greens , the town band , to a picnic and spent the entire day listening , while his family spent the day looking . 
14497	br-g39	4	16	305946	The disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping_an_eye_on the boy . 
14498	br-g39	4	17	305961	But one afternoon Mrs._Mercer met her ; both were obviously on_the_way to the Mercer home . 
14499	br-g39	4	18	305977	The mother inquired , `` Where 's Johnny , and why did you leave him '' ? 
14500	br-g39	4	19	305994	`` There was nothing else I could do '' , the maid answered , satisfied with a rather vague explanation . 
14501	br-g39	4	20	306015	But Mrs._Mercer demanded more . 
14502	br-g39	4	21	306020	The maid then told her , `` Because he fired me '' . 
14503	br-g39	5	22	306033	With her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music - though she waited until he was ten - beginning with the piano and following that with the trumpet . 
14504	br-g39	5	23	306077	Young Mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instruments . 
14505	br-g39	5	24	306089	Still , he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the Woodberry_Forest_School , near Orange , Virginia , where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well . 
14506	br-g39	6	25	306123	When he was fifteen John_H._Mercer turned_out his first song , a jazzy little thing he called `` Sister_Susie , Strut_Your_Stuff '' . 
14507	br-g39	6	26	306145	If his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been , Mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect . 
14508	br-g39	6	27	306178	From his playmates in Savannah , Mercer had picked_up , along with a soft Southern dialect , traces also of the Gullah dialects of Africa . 
14509	br-g39	6	28	306204	Such speech differences made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language . 
14510	br-g39	7	29	306219	During the summers , while he was still in school , Mercer worked for his father 's firm as a messenger_boy . 
14511	br-g39	7	30	306241	It generally took well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer 's help . 
14512	br-g39	7	31	306259	`` We 'd give him things to deliver , letters , checks , deeds and things like that '' , remembers his half-brother Walter , still in the real_estate business in savannah , `` and learn days later that he 'd absent-mindedly stuffed them into his pocket . 
14513	br-g39	7	32	306307	There they stayed '' . 
14514	br-g39	8	33	306312	This rather detached attitude toward life 's encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in Mercer 's personality ever since . 
14515	br-g39	8	34	306334	It is , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not_only has Mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure . 
14516	br-g39	8	35	306376	He has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer ( his records have sold in the millions ) and is a sharp businessman . 
14517	br-g39	9	36	306401	He has also an extraordinary conscience . 
14518	br-g39	9	37	306408	In 1927 his father 's business collapsed , and , rather_than go bankrupt , Mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank for liquidation . 
14519	br-g39	9	38	306434	He died before he could completely pay_off his debts . 
14520	br-g39	9	39	306444	Some years later the bank handling the Mercer liquidation received a check for $ 300000 , enough to clear_up the debt . 
14521	br-g39	9	40	306466	The check had been mailed from Chicago , the envelope bore no return_address , and the check was not signed . 
14522	br-g39	10	41	306487	`` That 's Johnny '' , sighed the bank president , `` the best hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded '' . 
14523	br-g39	10	42	306511	But Mercer 's explanation was simple : `` I made_out the check and carried it around a_few days unsigned - in_case I lost it '' . 
14524	br-g39	10	43	306537	When he remembered that he might have not signed the check , Mercer made_out another for the same amount , instructing the bank to destroy the other - especially if he had happened_to have absent-mindedly signed both of them . 
14525	br-g39	11	44	306577	When the family business failed , Mercer left school and on his mother 's urging - for she hoped that he would become an actor - he joined a local little theater group . 
14526	br-g39	11	45	306611	When the troupe traveled_to New_York to participate in a one act play competition - and won - Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in New_York . 
14527	br-g39	11	46	306646	He had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah . 
14528	br-g39	11	47	306674	But Mercer hung_on , living , after_a_fashion , in a Greenwich_Village fourth flight walk-up . 
14529	br-g39	11	48	306689	`` The place had no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub '' , his mother discovered when she visited him . 
14530	br-g39	11	49	306711	`` Johnny insisted on cooking a chicken dinner in my honor - he 's always been a good cook - and I 'll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub '' . 
14531	br-g39	12	50	306745	A story , no_doubt apocryphal , for Mercer himself denies it , has him sporting a monocle in those Village days . 
14532	br-g39	12	51	306767	Though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade_mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers . 
14533	br-g39	12	52	306792	One day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monocle and broke it . 
14534	br-g39	12	53	306819	The innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monocle - and did , over the protests of the former owner - with a square monocle . 
14535	br-g39	12	54	306857	Mercer is_supposed_to have refused it with , `` Anyone who wears a square monocle must be affected '' ! 
14536	br-g39	13	55	306876	Everett_Miller , then assistant director for the Garrick_Gaieties , a Theatre_Guild production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written ; he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however . 
14537	br-g39	13	56	306913	For him Mercer produced the lyric to `` Out_of_Breath_Scared_to_Death_of_You '' , introduced in that most successful of all the Gaieties , by Sterling_Holloway . 
14538	br-g39	13	57	306937	This 1930 edition also had songs in it by Vernon_Duke and Ira_Gershwin , by E._Y._Harburg and Duke , and by Harry_Myers . 
14539	br-g39	13	58	306959	Entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged the burgeoning song_writer to take a wife , Elizabeth_Meehan , a dancer in the Gaieties . 
14540	br-g39	13	59	306983	The Mercers took_up residence in Brooklyn , and Mercer found a regular job in Wall_Street `` misplacing stocks and bonds '' . 
14541	br-g39	14	60	307005	When he heard that Paul_Whiteman was looking_for singers to replace the Rhythm_Boys , Mercer applied and got the job , `` not for my voice , I 'm sure , but because I could write songs and material generally '' . 
14542	br-g39	14	61	307046	While with the Whiteman band Mercer met Jerry_Arlen . 
14543	br-g39	14	62	307055	He had yet to meet Harold_Arlen , for although they had `` collaborated '' on `` Satan 's Li ' l Lamb '' , Mercer and Harburg had worked from a lead_sheet the composer had furnished them . 
14544	br-g39	14	63	307093	The lyric , Mercer remembers , was tailored to fit the unusual melody . 
14545	br-g39	15	64	307107	Mercer 's Whiteman association brought him into contact with Hoagy_Carmichael , whose `` Snowball '' Mercer relyriced as `` Lazybones '' , in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of Mercer 's song writing career . 
14546	br-g39	15	65	307148	After leaving Whiteman , Mercer joined the Benny_Goodman band as a vocalist . 
14547	br-g39	15	66	307161	With the help of Ziggy_Elman , also in the band , he transformed a traditional Jewish melody into a popular song , `` And_the_Angels_Sing '' . 
14548	br-g39	15	67	307187	The countrywide success of `` Lazybones '' and `` And_the_Angels_Sing '' could only lead to Hollywood , where , besides Harold_Arlen , Mercer collaborated with Harry_Warren , Jimmy_Van_Heusen , Richard_Whiting , Walter_Donaldson , Jerome_Kern , and Arthur_Schwartz . 
14549	br-g39	15	68	307225	Mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs . 
14550	br-g39	15	69	307237	He may be the only song_writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the U._S._Treasury ; he collaborated on a song with William_Hartman_Woodin , who was Secretary of the Treasury , 1932 - 33 . 
14551	br-g39	16	70	307273	When Johnny_Mercer and Harold_Arlen began their collaboration in 1940 , Mercer , like Arlen , had several substantial film songs to his credit , among them `` Hooray_for_Hollywood '' , `` Ride , Tenderfoot , Ride '' , `` Have_You_Got_Any_Castles , Baby ? '' 
14552	br-g39	16	71	307317	, and `` Too_Marvelous_for_Words '' ( all with Richard_Whiting ) ; with Harry_Warren he did `` The_Girl_Friend_of_the_Whirling_Dervish '' , `` Jeepers Creepers '' , and `` You_Must_Have_Been_a_Beautiful_Baby '' . 
14553	br-g39	16	72	307346	Mercer 's lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances , a puckish sense_of_humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair . 
14554	br-g39	16	73	307370	Though versatile and capable of turning_out a ballad lyric with the best of them , Mercer 's forte is a highly polished quasi folk wit . 
14555	br-g39	17	74	307396	His casual , dreamlike working methods , often as not in_absentia , were an abrupt change from Harburg 's , so that Arlen had_to adjust again to another approach to collaboration . 
14556	br-g39	17	75	307428	There were times that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously . 
14557	br-g39	18	76	307439	Speaking of his work with Johnny_Mercer , Arlen says , `` Our working habits were strange . 
14558	br-g39	18	77	307456	After we got a script and the spots for the songs were blocked_out , we 'd get_together for an hour or_so every_day . 
14559	br-g39	18	78	307479	While Johnny made himself comfortable on the couch , I 'd play the tunes for him . 
14560	br-g39	18	79	307496	He has a wonderfully retentive memory . 
14561	br-g39	18	80	307503	After I would finish playing the songs , he 'd just go_away without a comment . 
14562	br-g39	18	81	307519	I would n't hear from him for a_couple_of weeks , then he 'd come around with the completed lyric '' . 
14563	br-g39	19	82	307540	Arlen is one of the few ( possibly the only ) composer Mercer has been able to work with so closely , for they held their meetings in Arlen 's study . 
14564	br-g39	19	83	307572	`` Some guys bothered me '' , Mercer has said . 
14565	br-g39	19	84	307583	`` I could n't write with them in the same room with me , but I could with Harold . 
14566	br-g39	19	85	307603	He is probably our most original composer ; he often uses very odd rhythms , which makes it difficult , and challenging , for the lyric writer '' . 
14567	br-g39	20	86	307632	While Arlen and Mercer collaborated on Hot_Nocturne , Mercer worked also with Arthur_Schwartz on another film , Navy_Blues . 
14568	br-g39	20	87	307651	Arlen , too , worked_on other projects at_the_same_time with old friend Ted_Koehler . 
14569	br-g39	20	88	307664	Besides doing a single song , `` When_the_Sun_Comes_Out '' , they worked_on the ambitious Americanegro_Suite , for voices and piano , as_well_as songs for films . 
14570	br-g39	21	89	307690	The Americanegro_Suite is in_a_sense an extension of the Cotton_Club songs in_that it is a collection of Negro songs , not for a night_club , but for the concert stage . 
14571	br-g39	21	90	307720	The work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight bar musical strain to which Koehler set the words `` There 'll be no more work / There 'll be no more worry '' , matching the spiritual feeling of the jot . 
14572	br-g39	21	91	307763	This grew_into the song `` Big_Time_Comin '' ' . 
14573	br-g39	21	92	307772	By September 1940 the suite had developed into a collection of six songs , `` four spirituals , a dream , and a lullaby '' . 
14574	br-g39	22	93	307798	The Negro composer Hall_Johnson studied the Americanegro_Suite and said of it , `` Of all the many songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a Negroid idiom in both words and music , these six songs by Harold_Arlen and Ted_Koehler easily stand far out above the rest . 
14575	br-g39	22	94	307850	Thoroughly modern in treatment , they are at_the_same_time , full of simple sincerity which invariably characterizes genuine Negro folk-music and are by_no_means to be confused with the average ' Broadway Spirituals ' which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the ' Amen_Corner ' , ' judgement_day ' , ' Gabriel 's horn ' , and a frustrated devil - with a_few random ' Hallelujahs ' thrown_in for_good_measure . 
14576	br-g43	1	1	307921	Two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time . 
14577	br-g43	1	2	307937	One , a reservation on the point I have just made , is the phenomenon of pseudo thinking , pseudo feeling , and pseudo willing , which Fromm discussed in The_Escape_from_Freedom . 
14578	br-g43	1	3	307969	In_essence this involves grounding one 's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather_than in one 's own values and experience . 
14579	br-g43	1	4	307995	There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else . 
14580	br-g43	1	5	308023	Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important . 
14581	br-g43	1	6	308034	Moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo thinking ; if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity . 
14582	br-g43	2	7	308079	The second timely part of_this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary_works and the ephemeral mass_culture products of today . 
14583	br-g43	2	8	308111	In the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get_along all_right with life_styles one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson in differentiation . 
14584	br-g43	2	9	308142	The reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species . 
14585	br-g43	2	10	308174	The observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else . 
14586	br-g43	2	11	308204	And this , I think , holds for values as_well as life_styles . 
14587	br-g43	2	12	308217	One would need_to test this proposition carefully ; after_all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) Reader 's Digest literature on the `` most unforgettable character I ever met '' deals with village grocers , country_doctors , favorite if illiterate aunts , and_so_forth . 
14588	br-g43	2	13	308262	Scientists often turn_out to be idiosyncratic , too . 
14589	br-g43	2	14	308271	But still , the proposition is worth examination . 
14590	br-g43	3	15	308280	It is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of `` right '' and `` wrong '' . 
14591	br-g43	3	16	308309	I do not know that this is true ; both Flugel and Ranyard_West deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as Niebuhr and Buber . 
14592	br-g43	3	17	308340	It forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of psychotherapy . 
14593	br-g43	3	18	308354	I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary_study in the development of conscience - most_of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of_course , to the influence of religion . 
14594	br-g43	4	19	308406	Still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one 's ideas of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic_books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of_this influence . 
14595	br-g43	4	20	308449	Probably the most important thing to focus_on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available . 
14596	br-g43	4	21	308493	This is in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that people do and should do and_how one should regard it . 
14597	br-g43	4	22	308521	In a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint . 
14598	br-g43	5	23	308578	Literature may be said to give people a sense_of_purpose , dedication , mission , significance . 
14599	br-g43	5	24	308594	This , no_doubt , is part of what Gilbert_Seldes implies when he says of the arts , `` They give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense '' . 
14600	br-g43	5	25	308629	Men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that_is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized . 
14601	br-g43	5	26	308663	Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation . 
14602	br-g43	5	27	308673	A need so deeply planted , asking for direction , so_to_speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature . 
14603	br-g43	5	28	308700	The terms `` renewal '' and `` refreshed '' , which often come_up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal '' of purpose and a `` refreshed '' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction . 
14604	br-g43	5	29	308750	The notion of `` inspiration '' is somehow cognate to this feeling . 
14605	br-g43	5	30	308763	How literature does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message '' , as_well_as the source , would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense_of_purpose . 
14606	br-g43	6	31	308807	One of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion . 
14607	br-g43	6	32	308829	Let us differentiate a_few of these ideas . 
14608	br-g43	6	33	308837	The Aristotelian notion of catharsis , the purging of emotion , is a persistent and viable one . 
14609	br-g43	6	34	308855	The idea here is one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view , Plato 's notion of the arousal of emotion . 
14610	br-g43	6	35	308882	A third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional conflicts , giving a sense of serenity and calm to individuals . 
14611	br-g43	6	36	308905	This is given some expression in Beardsley 's notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision . 
14612	br-g43	6	37	308922	A fourth view is the transformation of emotion , as in Housman 's fine phrase on the arts : 
14613	br-g43	6	38	308941	they `` transform and beautify our inner nature '' . 
14614	br-g43	6	39	308951	It is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea . 
14615	br-g43	6	40	308966	F._S._C._Northrop , in his discussion of the `` Functions_and_Future_of_Poetry '' , suggests this : 
14616	br-g43	6	41	308980	`` One of the things which makes our lives drab and empty and which leaves us , at the end of the day , fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern of common-sense objects . 
14617	br-g43	6	42	309023	If art is to release us from these postulated things [ things we must think symbolically about ] and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy , it must sever its connection with these common_sense entities '' . 
14618	br-g43	6	43	309072	I take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality_of_life without literature and a life enriched by it . 
14619	br-g43	6	44	309096	Richards ' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety : for him it constitutes , in part , the organization of impulses . 
14620	br-g43	7	45	309122	A sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have_to take_account of all_of these . 
14621	br-g43	7	46	309140	But there is one in_particular which , it seems to me , deserves special attention . 
14622	br-g43	7	47	309156	In the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate . 
14623	br-g43	7	48	309191	The study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way . 
14624	br-g43	7	49	309204	William_Wimsatt and Cleanth_Brooks , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in_which this control is effected : `` For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) - then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at_all . 
14625	br-g43	7	50	309313	Something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like '' expressions `` of these emotions , without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement '' . 
14626	br-g43	7	51	309372	The rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience . 
14627	br-g43	7	52	309390	Here I do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion . 
14628	br-g43	7	53	309402	I mean something more like Freud 's concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he plays `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` fireman '' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control . 
14629	br-g43	8	54	309453	There is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time . 
14630	br-g43	8	55	309480	In B._M._Spinley 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience . 
14631	br-g43	8	56	309520	Perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation . 
14632	br-g43	8	57	309556	Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean . 
14633	br-g43	8	58	309572	It is at_least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as_well_as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature . 
14634	br-g43	9	59	309596	In any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with_respect_to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature '' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required . 
14635	br-g43	9	60	309654	In the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for_example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy_life regarded_as forbidden , or by half conscious ideas about the magical_power of words ? 
14636	br-g43	9	61	309755	These are , if the research is done with subtlety and skill , researchable topics , but the research is missing . 
14637	br-g43	10	62	309777	One of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide . 
14638	br-g43	10	63	309800	Sensibility is a vague word , covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill . 
14639	br-g43	10	64	309822	Among_other_things it means perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle differences . 
14640	br-g43	10	65	309834	Both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged . 
14641	br-g43	10	66	309856	Its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the English_professor with whom one attends the theatre . 
14642	br-g43	10	67	309879	The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English_professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor_cars , political candidates , or female beauty . 
14643	br-g43	10	68	309911	Along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen . 
14644	br-g43	10	69	309937	In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; Solomon_Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human_beings and events . 
14645	br-g43	10	70	309998	But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap . 
14646	br-g43	11	71	310029	I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth . 
14647	br-g43	11	72	310051	I use this term to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state_of_affairs , a tendency to look_at wholes rather_than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling . 
14648	br-g43	11	73	310093	It is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia . 
14649	br-g43	11	74	310105	I think these attributes cluster , but I have no evidence . 
14650	br-g43	11	75	310117	In_fact , I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art . 
14651	br-g44	1	1	310143	The late R._G._Collingwood , a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature , once wrote `` We are all , though many_of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with Chaucer and Cimabue , or even Shakespeare and Titian . 
14652	br-g44	1	2	310203	By an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and Japanese colour prints ; but the possibility of this effort is bound_up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken_place . 
14653	br-g44	1	3	310281	The natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else '' . 
14654	br-g44	2	4	310312	One might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public , of the newspaper_critic , and of the creative artist himself . 
14655	br-g44	2	5	310351	There results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary . 
14656	br-g44	2	6	310365	Such study may take many forms . 
14657	br-g44	2	7	310372	The study of ideas in literature is one of these . 
14658	br-g44	2	8	310383	Of_course , it goes_without_saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene . 
14659	br-g44	2	9	310399	He will frequently return to it . 
14660	br-g44	2	10	310406	The continuities , contrasts , and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other . 
14661	br-g44	3	11	310433	When we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption . 
14662	br-g44	3	12	310451	Most students of literature , whether they call themselves scholars or critics , are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary_works as_well_as to enjoy them . 
14663	br-g44	3	13	310480	Many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding . 
14664	br-g44	3	14	310494	This understanding , of_course , may in_its_turn take many forms and some of these - especially those most interesting to the student of comparative_literature - are essentially historical . 
14665	br-g44	3	15	310523	But the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form , `` texture '' , or technique . 
14666	br-g44	3	16	310549	He may also consider ideas . 
14667	br-g44	3	17	310555	It is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in_the_end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight . 
14668	br-g44	3	18	310594	But , in_general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other . 
14669	br-g44	4	19	310618	At this point a working definition of idea is in_order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed . 
14670	br-g44	4	20	310643	The term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as_opposed_to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience . 
14671	br-g44	4	21	310663	It is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy . 
14672	br-g44	4	22	310673	An idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned . 
14673	br-g44	4	23	310697	In this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so_to_speak `` writ_large '' in history of literature where they recur continually . 
14674	br-g44	4	24	310734	Outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries ; also secondary notions such_as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man . 
14675	br-g44	4	25	310777	One might , indeed , argue that the history of ideas , in_so_far as it includes the literatures , must center_on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning . 
14676	br-g44	5	26	310830	We need not , to_be_sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature . 
14677	br-g44	5	27	310847	An idea , of the sort that we have_in_mind , although of_necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric_poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience . 
14678	br-g44	5	28	310891	Thus Burns 's `` My love is like a red , red rose '' and Hopkins ' `` The thunder-purple sea beach , plumed purple of thunder '' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned . 
14679	br-g44	5	29	310938	On_the_other_hand , Arnold 's `` The unplumbed , salt , estranging sea '' , taken in its context , certainly does so . 
14680	br-g44	6	30	310961	Understanding a work_of_art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies . 
14681	br-g44	6	31	310975	Thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject_matter typical or atypical of its period . 
14682	br-g44	6	32	311009	Again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways . 
14683	br-g44	6	33	311035	Our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries . 
14684	br-g44	6	34	311045	Very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs_to '' some way of thought labelled as a `` school '' or an `` - ism '' , i._e. a complex or `` syndrome '' of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification . 
14685	br-g44	6	35	311099	Thus ideas like `` grace '' , `` salvation '' , and `` providence '' cluster together in traditional Christianity . 
14686	br-g44	6	36	311120	Usually the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in_question , so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an `` - ism '' or mode of thought . 
14687	br-g44	6	37	311165	Accordingly we may speak_of the Platonism peculiar to Shelley 's poems or the type of Stoicism present in Henley 's `` Invictus '' , and we may find that describing such Platonism or such Stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise . 
14688	br-g44	6	38	311221	After_all , Shelley is no `` orthodox '' or Hellenic Platonist , and even his `` romantic '' Platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries . 
14689	br-g44	6	39	311249	Again , Henley 's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self mastery is far from characteristic of a Stoic thinker like Marcus_Aurelius , whose gentle acquiescence is almost Christian , comparable_to the patience expressed in Milton 's sonnet on his own blindness . 
14690	br-g44	7	40	311294	In recent years , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts , although these aspects should be studied in_conjunction_with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the sciences . 
14691	br-g44	7	41	311353	When these fields are surveyed together , important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine_arts and even , to some extent , with science . 
14692	br-g44	8	42	311408	Here we may observe that at_least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian 's research . 
14693	br-g44	8	43	311436	Let us quote once_more from R._G._Collingwood : `` History is properly concerned with the actions of human_beings . 
14694	br-g44	8	44	311454	Regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world ; regarded from the inside , it is the carrying_into_action of a certain thought . 
14695	br-g44	8	45	311488	The historian 's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them . 
14696	br-g44	8	46	311517	It is a characteristic of thoughts that , in re-thinking them we come , ipso_facto , to understand why they were thought '' . 
14697	br-g44	8	47	311541	Such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition . 
14698	br-g44	8	48	311560	`` History has this in_common with every other science : that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in_the_first_place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based . 
14699	br-g44	8	49	311622	This is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential . 
14700	br-g44	8	50	311636	The knowledge in_virtue_of_which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events '' . 
14701	br-g44	8	51	311660	It is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by_no_means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research . 
14702	br-g44	9	52	311709	The student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at_the_same_time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another . 
14703	br-g44	9	53	311746	Let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades . 
14704	br-g44	9	54	311780	We may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts . 
14705	br-g44	9	55	311810	Finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at_present widespread . 
14706	br-g44	9	56	311828	No one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them . 
14707	br-g44	9	57	311860	Still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature . 
14708	br-g44	9	58	311901	The actual moments of contact are vitally important . 
14709	br-g44	9	59	311910	These moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative_literature must be frequently concerned . 
14710	br-g44	10	60	311932	Perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the Western world has been that of the Old and New_Testament . 
14711	br-g44	10	61	311955	Certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of Western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the Bible . 
14712	br-g44	10	62	312002	This reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence . 
14713	br-g44	10	63	312014	A contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , St._Augustine , John_Bunyan , and Thomas_Jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great_deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression . 
14714	br-g44	10	64	312069	In much the same way , we recognize the importance of Shakespeare 's familarity with Plutarch and Montaigne , of Shelley 's study of Plato 's dialogues , and of Coleridge 's enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from Plato to Schelling and William_Godwin , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of English men_of_letters . 
14715	br-g44	11	65	312133	We may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists . 
14716	br-g44	11	66	312152	English philosopher Samuel_Alexander 's debt to Wordsworth and Meredith is a recent interesting example , as also A._N._Whitehead 's understanding of the English romantics , chiefly Shelley and Wordsworth . 
14717	br-g44	11	67	312182	Hegel 's profound admiration for the insights of the Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth century philosophy . 
14718	br-g44	11	68	312205	Again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating , if to our minds grotesque , anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in Lucretius , who in_turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher Empedocles . 
14719	br-g44	12	69	312252	Here an important caveat is in_order . 
14720	br-g44	12	70	312259	We must avoid the notion , suggested to some people by examples such_as those just mentioned , that ideas are `` units '' in_some_way comparable_to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even , for_that_matter , from one individual to another . 
14721	br-h09	1	1	312310	Be it enacted by the Senate and House_of_Representatives of the United_States_of_America in Congress assembled , That the Act of July 3 , 1952 ( 66 Stat. 328 ) as amended ( 42 U._S._C. 1952 - 1958 ) , is further amended to read as_follows :

14740	br-h09	21	20	312992	Research and development activities undertaken by the Secretary shall be coordinated or conducted jointly with the Department_of_Defense to the end that developments under this Act which are primarily of a civil nature will contribute to the defense of the Nation and that developments which are primarily of a military nature will , to the greatest practicable extent compatible with military and security requirements , be available to advance the purposes of_this Act and to strengthen the civil economy of the Nation . 
14741	br-h09	21	21	313074	The fullest cooperation by and with Atomic_Energy_Commission , the Department_of_Health_Education_and_Welfare , the Department_of_State , and other concerned agencies shall also be carried_out in the interest of achieving the objectives of_this Act . 
14742	br-h09	22	22	313106	All research within the United_States contracted for , sponsored , cosponsored , or authorized under authority of_this Act , shall be provided for in such manner that all information , uses , products , processes , patents , and other developments resulting from such research developed by Government expenditure will ( with such exceptions and limitations , if any , as the Secretary may find to be necessary in the interest of national defense ) be available to the general public .

14750	br-h09	28	30	313575	Section 4 of the joint_resolution of September 2 , 1958 ( 72 Stat. 1707 ; 42 U._S._C. 1958 ( d ) ) , is hereby amended to read : 
14751	br-h09	29	31	313604	The authority of the Secretary_of_the_Interior under this joint_resolution to construct , operate , and maintain demonstration plants shall terminate upon the expiration of twelve years after the date on which this joint_resolution is approved . 
14752	br-h09	29	32	313639	Upon the expiration of a period deemed adequate for demonstration purposes for each plant , but not to exceed such twelve year period , the Secretary shall proceed as promptly as practicable to dispose of any plants so constructed by sale to the highest bidder , or as may otherwise be directed by Act of Congress . 
14753	br-h09	29	33	313696	Upon such sale , there shall be returned to any State or public agency which has contributed financial assistance under section 3 of_this joint_resolution a proper share of the net proceeds of the sale . 
14754	br-h09	30	34	313731	Approved September 22 , 1961 . 
14755	br-h09	31	35	313737	Be it enacted by the Senate and House_of_Representatives of the United_States_of_America in Congress assembled , That the Secretary_of_the_Interior is hereby authorized and directed to make or cause to be made a study covering - 
14756	br-h09	32	36	313771	the causes of injuries and health hazards in metal and nonmetallic mines ( excluding coal and lignite mines ) ; 
14757	br-h09	33	37	313791	the relative effectiveness of voluntary versus mandatory reporting of accident statistics ; 
14758	br-h09	34	38	313803	the relative contribution to safety of inspection programs embodying - 
14759	br-h09	36	39	313813	right-of-entry only and right-of-entry plus enforcement authority ; 
14760	br-h09	37	40	313821	the effectiveness of health and safety education and training ; 
14761	br-h09	39	41	313831	the magnitude of effort and costs of each of these possible phases of an effective safety program for metal and nonmetallic mines ( excluding coal and lignite mines ) ; and the scope and adequacy of State mine safety laws applicable to such mines and the enforcement of such laws . 
14762	br-h09	40	42	313882	The Secretary_of_the_Interior or any duly authorized representative shall be entitled to admission to , and to require reports from the operator of , any metal or nonmetallic mine which is in a State ( excluding any coal or lignite mine ) , the products of_which regularly enter commerce or the operations of_which substantially affect commerce , for the purpose of gathering data and information necessary for the study authorized in the first section of_this Act . 
14763	br-h09	41	43	313958	As used in_this section - 
14764	br-h09	43	44	313963	the term `` State '' includes the Commonwealth of Puerto_Rico and any possession of the United_States ; and the term `` commerce '' means commerce between any State and any place outside thereof , or between points within the same State but through any place outside thereof . 
14765	br-h09	44	45	314011	The Secretary_of_the_Interior shall submit a report of his findings , together with recommendations for an effective safety program for metal and nonmetallic mines ( excluding coal and lignite mines ) based upon such findings , to the Congress not more_than two years after the date of enactment of_this Act . 
14766	br-h09	45	46	314061	Approved September 26 , 1961 . 
14767	br-h09	46	47	314067	Be it enacted by the Senate and House_of_Representatives of the United_States_of_America in Congress assembled , That the Secretary_of_the_Interior is hereby authorized and directed to establish and maintain a program of stabilization payments to small domestic producers of lead and zinc ores and concentrates in_order to stabilize the mining of lead and zinc by small domestic producers on public , Indian , and other lands as provided in_this Act . 
14768	br-h09	47	48	314136	Subject_to the limitations of_this Act , the Secretary shall make stabilization payments to small domestic producers upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to him of their status as such producers and of the sale by them of newly mined ores , or concentrates produced therefrom , as provided in_this Act . 
14769	br-h09	47	49	314186	Payments shall be made only with_respect_to the metal content as determined by assay . 
14770	br-h09	48	50	314200	Such payments shall be made to small domestic producers of lead as_long_as the market_price for common lead at New_York , New_York , as determined by the Secretary , is below 14 - 1 2 cents per pound , and such payments shall be 75 per centum of the difference between 14 - 1 2 cents per pound and the average market_price for the month in_which the sale occurred as determined by the Secretary . 
14771	br-h09	49	51	314274	Such payments shall be made to small domestic producers of zinc as_long_as the market_price for prime western zinc at East_Saint_Louis , Illinois , as determined by the Secretary , is below 14 - 1 2 cents per pound , and such payments shall be 55 per centum of the difference between 14 - 1 2 cents per pound and the average market_price for the month in_which the sale occurred as determined by the Secretary . 
14772	br-h09	50	52	314349	The maximum amount of payments which may be made pursuant to this Act on_account_of sales of newly mined ores or concentrates produced therefrom made during the calendar_year 1962 shall not exceed $ 4500000 ; the maximum amount of such payments which may be made on_account_of such sales made during the calendar_year 1963 shall not exceed $ 4500000 ; the maximum amount of such payments which may be made on_account_of such sales made during the calendar_year 1964 shall not exceed $ 4000000 ; and the maximum amount of such payments which may be made on_account_of such sales made during the calendar_year 1965 shall not exceed $ 3500000 . 
14773	br-h11	1	1	314456	Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb_calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile . 
14774	br-h11	1	2	314485	This work gave a heat_of_formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a_few years ago . 
14775	br-h11	1	3	314522	Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat_of_formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride . 
14776	br-h11	2	4	314544	The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion . 
14777	br-h11	2	5	314559	In one of these , an exploding wire device to study systems thermodynamically up_to 6000 * * f and 100 atmospheres pressure , a major goal was achieved . 
14778	br-h11	2	6	314588	The accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a_few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat_energy produced had an uncertainty of less_than 2 percent . 
14779	br-h11	2	7	314623	This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals . 
14780	br-h11	2	8	314635	The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter . 
14781	br-h11	2	9	314648	The element is inserted in the discharge circuit in_place_of the exploding wire , and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy . 
14782	br-h11	2	10	314674	This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element . 
14783	br-h11	3	11	314705	A high-speed shutter has been developed in_order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion . 
14784	br-h11	3	12	314725	The shutter consists_of two parts : a fast opening part and a fast closing part . 
14785	br-h11	3	13	314741	Using Edgerton 's method , the fast closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires . 
14786	br-h11	3	14	314767	The fast opening of the shutter consists_of a piece of aluminum_foil ( approximately * * f ) placed directly in_front of the camera_lens so that no light may pass into the camera . 
14787	br-h11	3	15	314800	The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil . 
14788	br-h11	3	16	314821	During the discharge the magnetic_forces set_up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center_line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera . 
14789	br-h11	3	17	314854	Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60 - 80 microseconds . 
14790	br-h11	3	18	314871	The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil . 
14791	br-h11	4	19	314895	Besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength , the spectra of extraterrestrial radio_sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules . 
14792	br-h11	4	20	314925	The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres . 
14793	br-h11	4	21	314950	Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH ; somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and ScH . 
14794	br-h11	4	22	314984	Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; in interstellar gas , concentrations as low as * * f molecules / * * f may be sufficient , as compared to the * * f hydrogen_atoms * * f required for detection of the 21 - cm line . 
14795	br-h11	5	23	315035	High sensitivity in radio_telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver ; therefore , only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio_spectra of these molecules feasible . 
14796	br-h11	5	24	315071	To secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free_radical microwave spectroscopy has been started . 
14797	br-h11	5	25	315090	Since conventional methods are insensitive at the low_frequencies of these molecular transitions , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead . 
14798	br-h11	5	26	315112	This involves the application of a strong magnetic_field to the radical vapor , which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity . 
14799	br-h11	6	27	315146	The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the OH radical . 
14800	br-h11	6	28	315161	Results of_this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas ; the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 * * f , with an uncertainty of 0.10 * * f . 
14801	br-h11	6	29	315202	Success in observing these spectral lines has so_far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported . 
14802	br-h11	6	30	315227	Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals . 
14803	br-h11	7	31	315240	The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 * * f . 
14804	br-h11	7	32	315266	The efforts and accomplishments fall_into three main categories : absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors , and helium 4 vapor-pressure measurements ( see p. 144 ) . 
14805	br-h11	8	33	315310	An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 * * f . 
14806	br-h11	8	34	315338	Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute_temperature measurement , and may be used as_an_alternative to the gas_thermometer . 
14807	br-h11	8	35	315357	When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium 4 vapor_pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found . 
14808	br-h11	8	36	315389	This result is preliminary , and work is continuing . 
14809	br-h11	9	37	315399	Carbon resistors and impurity doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region . 
14810	br-h11	9	38	315422	Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor_pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most_of the liquid helium . 
14811	br-h11	9	39	315467	Preliminary calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 * * f at every 0.1 * * f . 
14812	br-h11	9	40	315489	The estimated standard_deviations of the data for two of the resistors were 1 millidegree ; and for the third resistor , 3.3 millidegrees . 
14813	br-h11	10	41	315513	The reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a `` constant temperature '' liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 * * f . 
14814	br-h11	10	42	315541	Surface temperature_gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15 - and 25 - liter metallic storage dewars . 
14815	br-h11	10	43	315564	The gradient was about one_half of a millidegree at 4.2 * * f but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the | l point . 
14816	br-h11	10	44	315593	A hydrostatic_head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor_pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium . 
14817	br-h11	10	45	315615	However , the surface temperature_gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube ( which passes_through the surface to the vapor_pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface . 
14818	br-h11	10	46	315654	It has also been observed , in helium 2 , , that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor_pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor_pressure thermometer . 
14819	br-h11	10	47	315682	This has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor_pressure thermometer . 
14820	br-h11	10	48	315695	In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow . 
14821	br-h11	11	49	315714	Precise pressure volume temperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent_on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer . 
14822	br-h11	11	50	315731	A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested . 
14823	br-h11	11	51	315743	The transducer is a null type instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm , 0.001 in. thick and 1 in. in diameter . 
14824	br-h11	11	52	315765	A small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced 0.001 in. apart ( for * * f ) . 
14825	br-h11	11	53	315795	Spherical concave backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit . 
14826	br-h11	11	54	315820	Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 * * f and at pressures up_to 250 atm , an overload of 300 psi , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at_most , one millimeter_of_mercury . 
14827	br-h11	12	55	315866	A 6 - year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed . 
14828	br-h11	12	56	315884	This project was carried_out under sponsorship of the Ballistic_Missile_Division_of_the_Air_Research_and_Development_Command , U._S._Air_Force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat_energy of chemical binding . 
14829	br-h11	12	57	315915	A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more_than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region . 
14830	br-h11	12	58	315939	Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present . 
14831	br-h11	12	59	315967	The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from * * f to * * f times normal density . 
14832	br-h11	13	60	316039	In March , 1961 , representatives of the national laboratories of Australia , Canada , The_Netherlands , United_Kingdom , U._S._S._R. , United_States , and West_Germany , met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 * * f . 
14833	br-h11	13	61	316088	As a first_step toward this goal , arrangements were worked_out for comparing the scales now in_use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance_thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory . 
14834	br-h11	13	62	316120	Such a group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the NBS . 
14835	br-h11	13	63	316133	These thermometers have now been sent to the United_Kingdom for calibration at the National_Physical_Laboratory . 
14836	br-h11	14	64	316148	During the last week of march 1961 , Columbus , Ohio was the site of the Fourth_Symposium_on_Temperature , Its_Measurement_and_Control_in_Science_and_Industry . 
14837	br-h11	14	65	316168	The Symposium , which was jointly sponsored by the American_Institute_of_Physics , the Instrument_Society_of_America , and the National_Bureau_of_Standards , attracted nearly one_thousand registrants , including many from abroad . 
14838	br-h11	14	66	316196	The Bureau contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr._W._A._Wildhack , General_Chairman , and Dr._C._M._Herzfeld , Program_Chairman . 
14839	br-h11	14	67	316220	Dr._A._V._Astin , NBS_Director , opened the 5 - day session with introductory remarks , following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists , from both the Washington and Boulder_Laboratories . 
14840	br-h11	15	68	316257	In_addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards , spectroscopy , solid_state physics , interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress , the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics . 
14841	br-h11	15	69	316300	The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared , the application of infrared techniques to solid_state studies , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation . 
14842	br-h11	15	70	316333	Two data centers have been established for the collection , indexing , critical evaluation , and dissemination of bibliographies and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision cross_sections . 
14843	br-h11	16	71	316365	Under the sponsorship of the Office_of_Naval_Research and the Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency , a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities . 
14844	br-h11	16	72	316392	An exhaustive survey was made of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued . 
14845	br-h11	16	73	316413	Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation . 
14846	br-h11	17	74	316425	A wall stabilized high current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen . 
14847	br-h11	17	75	316446	This apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large_number of other elements . 
14848	br-h11	17	76	316463	A study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about * * f percent . 
14849	br-h11	18	77	316498	A set of tables containing spectral intensities for 39000 lines of 70 elements , as observed in a copper matrix in a d-c arc , was completed and published . 
14850	br-h11	18	78	316528	Studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities . 
14851	br-h11	18	79	316544	These data are not of the precision obtainable by the methods previously mentioned , but the vast number of approximate values available will be useful in many areas . 
14852	br-h11	19	80	316573	Research continues on the very complex spectra of the rare_earth elements . 
14853	br-h11	19	81	316585	New computer and automation techniques were applied to these spectra with considerable success .

14900	br-h13	1	1	318724	Mr._Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have . 
14901	br-h13	1	2	318759	The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex - high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two . 
14902	br-h13	1	3	318792	And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all_the_way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service . 
14903	br-h13	2	4	318820	There have been a number of sound plans proposed . 
14904	br-h13	2	5	318830	But none of these has been implemented . 
14905	br-h13	2	6	318838	Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping_hand . 
14906	br-h13	2	7	318860	Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each_day has increased tremendously since World_War_2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957 . 
14907	br-h13	2	8	318893	Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New_York_City area . 
14908	br-h13	2	9	318907	Here the New_York_Central_Railroad , one of the Nation 's most important carriers , has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949 . 
14909	br-h13	3	10	318931	At this time of crisis in our Nation 's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New_York_Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake_+_Ohio_Railroad 's proposal for control of the Baltimore_+_Ohio_railroads . 
14910	br-h13	4	11	318969	The New_York_Central has pointed_out that this control , if approved by the Interstate_Commerce_Commission , would give the combined C.+O. - B.+O._Railroad a total of 185 points served in_common with the New_York_Central . 
14911	br-h13	4	12	319001	Not_only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New_York_Central and other railroads serving the area . 
14912	br-h13	5	13	319032	The New_York_Central notes : `` The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. +_O._-_B. +_O. provides the backbone of Central 's revenues . 
14913	br-h13	5	14	319057	These revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New_York_Central system as_well_as the New_York area commuter and terminal freight services . 
14914	br-h13	5	15	319084	If these services are to be maintained , the New_York_Central must have the revenues to make them possible '' . 
14915	br-h13	6	16	319104	The New_York_Central today handles 60 percent of all southbound commuter_traffic coming into New_York_City . 
14916	br-h13	6	17	319118	This is a $ 14 million operation involving 3500 employees who work_on commuter_traffic exclusively . 
14917	br-h13	6	18	319133	A blow to this phase of the Central 's operations would have serious economic consequences not_only to the railroad itself , but to the 40000 people per day who are provided with efficient , reasonably priced transportation in_and_out of the city . 
14918	br-h13	6	19	319175	`` There is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful C. + O. - B. + O. merger scheme '' - 
14919	br-h13	7	20	319198	The Central has pointed_out . 
14920	br-h13	7	21	319203	`` The logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive two system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B._+_O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here . 
14921	br-h13	8	22	319235	Detailed studies of the plan were well underway . 
14922	br-h13	8	23	319244	Though far from completion , these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned , their investors , their customers , their users , and to the public at_large . 
14923	br-h13	9	24	319285	Then , abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , B. + O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations with C. + O. which resulted in the present situation . 
14924	br-h13	10	25	319318	In the light of the facts at_hand , however , New_York_Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two system eastern railroad structure in the public interest `` . 
14925	br-h13	11	26	319351	The Interstate_Commerce_Commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed C._+_O._-_B. + O. merger on June 18 . 
14926	br-h13	11	27	319368	Obviously , the Interstate_Commerce_Commission will not force the New_York_Central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge . 
14927	br-h13	12	28	319396	However , there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss . 
14928	br-h13	12	29	319413	That_is , will it serve the long-range public interest ? 
14929	br-h13	13	30	319423	For the past 40 years Congress has advocated a carefully planned , balanced and competitive railway_system . 
14930	br-h13	13	31	319440	We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter - the two-way B. +_O._-_C._+ O. merger , or the three_way New_York_Central B._+_O._-_C._+_O. merger . 
14931	br-h13	13	32	319468	Which will serve not_only the best interest of the stockholders , but the interests of all the traveling public ? 
14932	br-h13	14	33	319488	Mr._Speaker , I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the New_York_Times , on the occasion of a major change in its top_executive command . 
14933	br-h13	15	34	319516	Arthur_Hays_Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement . 
14934	br-h13	15	35	319549	I am pleased to note that Mr._Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman_of_the_board of the New_York_Times . 
14935	br-h13	16	36	319566	Mr._Sulzberger 's successor as publisher is Mr._Orvil_E._Dryfoos , who is president of the New_York_Times_Co. , and who has been with the Times since 1942 . 
14936	br-h13	16	37	319591	Mr._Dryfoos ' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world 's great newspapers will be maintained . 
14937	br-h13	17	38	319619	I am also pleased to note that Mr._John_B._Oakes , a member of the Times staff since 1946 , has been appointed as editorial page editor . 
14938	br-h13	17	39	319645	Mr._Oakes succeeds Charles_Merz , editor since 1938 , who now becomes editor emeritus . 
14939	br-h13	18	40	319659	I should_like at this time , Mr._Speaker , to pay warm tribute to Arthur_Hays_Sulzberger and Charles_Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism . 
14940	br-h13	19	41	319688	My heartiest congratulations go to their successors , Orvil_E._Dryfoos and John_B._Oakes , who can be counted_upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New_York_Times . 
14941	br-h13	20	42	319713	The people of the 17_th District of New_York , and I as their Representative in Congress , take great pride in the New_York_Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world . 
14942	br-h13	21	43	319748	Mr._Speaker , in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a naval_blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western_Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe_Doctrine . 
14943	br-h13	21	44	319787	Yesterday , I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U._S._News_+_World_Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages . 
14944	br-h13	22	45	319822	Under leave to extend my remarks , I include the relevant portion of my newsletter , together with the text of the article from the U._S._News_+_World_Report : 
14945	br-h13	22	46	319849	`` 
14946	br-h13	23	47	319850	Cuban S._S._R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro held mainland last week , there was at_least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian dominated military base . 
14947	br-h13	24	48	319910	In_fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment . 
14948	br-h13	24	49	319947	Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought_home to all_of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home . 
14949	br-h13	24	50	319994	Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United_States , violate the Monroe_Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin_American republic . 
14950	br-h13	25	51	320021	Once the full extent of_this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President_Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone . 
14951	br-h13	25	52	320056	But the Latin_American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American_Defense_Board . 
14952	br-h13	25	53	320087	For years the United_States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro 's representative from secret military talks . 
14953	br-h13	25	54	320108	But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job . 
14954	br-h13	25	55	320125	There is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week . 
14955	br-h13	25	56	320137	You can see it , for_example , in the extensive efforts President_Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by_the_way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past . 
14956	br-h13	26	57	320191	What the next move will be only time , of_course , will tell . 
14957	br-h13	26	58	320205	Personally , I think we ought to set_up an immediate naval_blockade of Cuba . 
14958	br-h13	26	59	320219	We simply can n't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba . 
14959	br-h13	26	60	320241	Obviously , we can n't stop them from coming_in , however , just by talk . 
14960	br-h13	26	61	320257	A naval_blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe_Doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry_out , and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere `` . 
14961	br-h13	27	62	320291	Look_at Castro now - cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the_Americas . 
14962	br-h13	28	63	320306	How can the United_States act ? 
14963	br-h13	29	64	320312	Blockade is one answer offered by experts . 
14964	br-h13	29	65	320320	In it they see a way to isolate Cuba , stop infiltration , maybe finish Castro , too . 
14965	br-h13	30	66	320339	This is the question now facing President_Kennedy : 
14966	br-h13	30	67	320347	How to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere ? 
14967	br-h13	31	68	320366	On April 25 , the White_House reported that a total embargo of remaining U._S. trade with Cuba was being considered . 
14968	br-h13	31	69	320387	Its aim : To undermine further Cuba 's economy . 
14969	br-h13	31	70	320397	weaken Castro . 
14970	br-h13	32	71	320400	Another strategy - bolder and tougher - was also attracting notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro . 
14971	br-h13	33	72	320430	Blockade , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe_Doctrine . 
14972	br-h13	33	73	320448	It could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro . 
14973	br-h13	33	74	320463	It could stop Cuban re export of guns and propaganda materials to South_America . 
14974	br-h13	33	75	320477	It would be the most severe reprisal , short_of declared war , that the United_States could invoke against Castro . 
14975	br-h13	34	76	320497	It is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon . 
14976	br-h13	34	77	320527	As a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions . 
14977	br-h13	34	78	320547	Among these questions : 
14978	br-h13	35	79	320551	Military experts say a tight naval_blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task_forces , each built around an aircraft_carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers . 
14979	br-h13	36	80	320589	The Navy , on April 25 , announced it is bringing_back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean , increasing to four the number of attack_carriers in the vicinity of Cuba . 
14980	br-h13	36	81	320620	More than 36 other big Navy ships are no less_than a day 's sailing time away . 
14981	br-h13	37	82	320637	To round_out the blockading force , submarines would be needed - to locate , identify and track approaching vessels . 
14982	br-h13	37	83	320657	Land based radar would help with this task . 
14983	br-h13	37	84	320666	So would radar picket_ships . 
14984	br-h13	37	85	320671	A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task_forces . 
14985	br-h13	38	86	320690	Three requirements go_with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; and it must be enforced without discrimination . 
14986	br-h13	39	87	320720	Once these conditions of international_law are met , countries that try to run to blockade do so at their own risk . 
14987	br-h13	39	88	320742	Blockade runners can be stopped - by gunfire , if necessary - searched and held , at_least temporarily . 
14988	br-h13	39	89	320761	They could be sent to U._S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated . 
14989	br-h13	40	90	320776	Plenty , say the experts . 
14990	br-h13	40	91	320782	In a broad sense , it would reaffirm the Monroe_Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western_Hemisphere . 
14991	br-h13	40	92	320800	It could , by avoiding direct intervention , provide a short-of war strategy to meet short-of war infiltration . 
14992	br-h13	41	93	320819	Primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia . 
14993	br-h13	41	94	320839	Shipments of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband . 
14994	br-h13	41	95	320852	In a total blockade , action could also be taken against ships bringing_in chemicals , oils , textiles , and even foodstuffs . 
14995	br-h13	41	96	320875	At_times , three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports . 
14996	br-h14	1	1	320891	From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public_Law 236 , 66_th_Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation_program has been to assist the States , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful employment . 
14997	br-h14	1	2	320935	The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation_program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social_Security_Act in 1935 . 
14998	br-h14	1	3	320961	Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . 
14999	br-h14	1	4	320990	Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78_th_Congress in 1943 passed P._L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . 
15000	br-h14	2	5	321033	Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . 
15001	br-h14	2	6	321074	To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83_rd_Congress enacted the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954 ( P._L. 565 ) . 
15002	br-h14	2	7	321116	These amendments to the Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act were designed to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . 
15003	br-h14	3	8	321177	Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal_Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50_-_50 basis . 
15004	br-h14	3	9	321207	Under P._L. 113 , 78_th_Congress , the Federal_Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services . 
15005	br-h14	3	10	321251	Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry_out the provisions of the Act . 
15006	br-h14	4	11	321273	The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational_rehabilitation_program , providing_for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational_rehabilitation - and in_addition for short-term training and instruction . 
15007	br-h14	4	12	321327	The first part of the new structure - that for supporting the basic program of vocational_rehabilitation services - is described in this Section . 
15008	br-h14	4	13	321351	Subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure . 
15009	br-h14	5	14	321364	The following table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , appropriations , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching_funds for this part of the grant program . 
15010	br-h14	6	15	321396	In_order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational_rehabilitation services , Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a State 's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per_capita income . 
15011	br-h14	6	16	321453	The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State . 
15012	br-h14	6	17	321494	It stipulates , in_addition , that all amounts remaining as_a_result_of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums . 
15013	br-h14	6	18	321530	These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per_capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State . 
15014	br-h14	6	19	321582	The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already in_operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone . 
15015	br-h14	7	20	321614	The method used in computing the allotments is specifically set_forth in the Act . 
15016	br-h14	7	21	321628	The term `` State '' means the several States , the District_of_Columbia , the Virgin_Islands , Guam and Puerto_Rico ; the term `` United_States '' includes the several States and the District_of_Columbia , and excludes the Virgin_Islands , Guam and Puerto_Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii . 
15017	br-h14	7	22	321680	The following steps are employed in calculations : 
15018	br-h14	8	23	321688	For each State ( except Puerto_Rico , Guam , the Virgin_Islands , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) determine average per_capita income based_on the last three years . 
15019	br-h14	8	24	321720	( See Source_of_Data , below for per_capita income data to be used in this step . ) 
15020	br-h14	9	25	321737	Determine the average per_capita income for the U._S. based_on the last three years . 
15021	br-h14	9	26	321751	( See Source of Data , below , for per_capita income data to be used in this step . ) 
15022	br-h14	10	27	321771	Determine the ratio of 50 % to the average per_capita income of the U._S. ( Divide 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above . ) 
15023	br-h14	11	28	321798	Determine for each State ( except the Virgin_Islands , Guam and Puerto_Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50 % as the particular State 's average per_capita income bears to the average per_capita income of the U._S. . 
15024	br-h14	11	29	321849	( Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained for each State in item 1 above . ) 
15025	br-h14	12	30	321871	Determine the particular State 's `` allotment percentage '' . 
15026	br-h14	12	31	321881	By law this is 75 % for the Virgin_Islands , Guam and Puerto_Rico . 
15027	br-h14	12	32	321895	( Alaska and Hawaii had fixed allotment percentages in_effect prior to fiscal_year 1962 . ) 
15028	br-h14	13	33	321910	In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; except that no State shall have an allotment percentage less_than 33 - 1 3 % nor more_than 75 % . 
15029	br-h14	13	34	321951	If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more_than these extremes , the State 's allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme . 
15030	br-h14	14	35	321981	Square each State 's allotment percentage . 
15031	br-h14	15	36	321988	Determine each State 's population . 
15032	br-h14	15	37	321994	( See Source of Data , below for population data to be used in this step . ) 
15033	br-h14	16	38	322012	Multiply the population of each State by the square of its allotment percentage . 
15034	br-h14	16	39	322026	( Multiply result obtained in item 7 above , by result obtained in item 6 above . ) 
15035	br-h14	17	40	322044	Determine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above , for all the States . 
15036	br-h14	17	41	322061	( For each State , make all computations set_forth in items 1 to 8 above , and_then add the results obtained for each State in item 8 . ) 
15037	br-h14	18	42	322090	Determine the ratio that the amount being allotted is to the sum of the products for all the States . 
15038	br-h14	18	43	322110	( Divide the amount being allotted by the result obtained in item 9 above . ) 
15039	br-h14	19	44	322126	Determine the particular State 's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal_year . 
15040	br-h14	19	45	322138	( Multiply the State product in item 8 above by the result obtained in item 10 above . ) 
15041	br-h14	20	46	322157	Determine if the particular State 's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is greater than its maximum allotment , and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment . 
15042	br-h14	20	47	322192	( Each State 's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal_year , which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $ 23000000 , must be reduced by the amount of the excess . ) 
15043	br-h14	21	48	322244	Determine if the particular State 's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is less_than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment . 
15044	br-h14	21	49	322281	Regardless of its unadjusted allotment , each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each_year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal_year 1954 - increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to $ 23000000 . 
15045	br-h14	22	50	322328	The funds recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used : first , to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment ( item 13 above ) ; and second , to increase uniformly the allotments to those States whose allotments are below their maximums , with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum . 
15046	br-h14	23	51	322403	For the States which maintain two separate agencies - one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of persons other_than the blind - the Act specifies that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal_year 1954 . 
15047	br-h14	23	52	322461	Funds allotted in_addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine . 
15048	br-h14	24	53	322479	As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula . 
15049	br-h14	24	54	322505	Prior to 1960 , in_order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , State funds had to equal 1954 State funds . 
15050	br-h14	24	55	322530	Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related_to the fiscal capacity of the State , with a pivot of 40 % State ( or 60 % Federal ) participation in total program costs . 
15051	br-h14	24	56	322572	The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the law as that State 's `` Federal share '' . 
15052	br-h14	24	57	322598	For purposes of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the States `` unadjusted Federal share '' . 
15053	br-h14	24	58	322618	Beginning in 1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as_required ) 25 % a_year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40 % pivot State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50 % and 30 % , respectively . 
15054	br-h14	24	59	322680	The pre 1960 rate of Federal participation with_respect_to any State 's base allotment , as_well_as the adjusted rate in_effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is designated by the statute as that State 's `` adjusted Federal Share '' . 
15055	br-h14	24	60	322721	The provisions for determining a State 's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the States . 
15056	br-h14	24	61	322743	The purpose of the adjusted Federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted Federal share is to prevent dislocations from abrupt_changes in matching rates . 
15057	br-h14	25	62	322776	The method used for computing the respective Federal and State shares in total program costs is specifically set_forth in the Act . 
15058	br-h14	25	63	322798	The term `` State '' means the several States , the District_of_Columbia , the Virgin_Islands , Guam and Puerto_Rico ; the term `` United_States '' includes the several States and the District_of_Columbia and excludes the Virgin_Islands , Guam and Puerto_Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii . 
15059	br-h14	25	64	322849	The following steps are employed in the calculations : 
15060	br-h14	26	65	322858	For each State ( except the Virgin_Islands , Guam , Puerto_Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) , determine the average per_capita income for the last three years . 
15061	br-h14	26	66	322892	( the same amount used in item 1 under Method of Computing allotments , above . ) 
15062	br-h14	27	67	322909	Determine the average per_capita income for the United_States for the last three years . 
15063	br-h14	27	68	322923	( The same amount used in item 2 under Method of Computing Allotments , above . ) 
15064	br-h14	28	69	322940	Determine the ratio of 40 % to the average per_capita income of the United_States . 
15065	br-h14	28	70	322955	( Divide 40 by the amount used in item 2 above . ) 
15066	br-h14	29	71	322968	Determine for each State ( except the Virgin_Islands , Guam , Puerto_Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and hawaii ) , that percentage which bears the same ratio to 40 % as the particular State 's average per_capita income bears to the average per_capita income of the United_States . 
15067	br-h14	29	72	323020	( Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the amount used for each State in item 1 above . ) 
15068	br-h14	30	73	323042	Determine the particular State 's `` Federal Share '' . 
15069	br-h14	30	74	323052	By law this is 70 % for the Virgin_Islands , Guam and Puerto_Rico . 
15070	br-h14	30	75	323066	( Alaska and Hawaii had fixed Federal share percentages in_effect prior to fiscal_year 1962 . ) 
15071	br-h14	31	76	323082	In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; except that no State shall have a Federal share less_than 50 % nor more_than 70 % . 
15072	br-h14	31	77	323120	If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more_than these extremes , the State 's Federal share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme . 
15073	br-h15	1	1	323150	At the entrance side of the shelter , each roof beam is rested_on the inside 4 inches of the block wall . 
15074	br-h15	1	2	323172	The outside 4 - inch space is filled by mortaring blocks on edge . 
15075	br-h15	1	3	323186	The wooden bracing between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall . 
15076	br-h15	1	4	323203	Mortar is poured between this bracing and the 4 - inch blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding . 
15077	br-h15	1	5	323226	( For details see inset , fig. 5 . ) 
15078	br-h15	2	6	323236	The first one or two roof boards ( marked `` E '' in fig. 6 ) are slipped into place across the roof beams , from outside the shelter . 
15079	br-h15	2	7	323266	These boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams , from inside the shelter . 
15080	br-h15	2	8	323290	Concrete blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards . 
15081	br-h15	2	9	323303	The roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together . 
15082	br-h15	3	10	323316	Work on the roof continues in this way . 
15083	br-h15	3	11	323325	The last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter . 
15084	br-h15	4	12	323338	When the roof blocks are all in_place , the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position . 
15085	br-h15	4	13	323357	The structure is complete . 
15086	br-h15	4	14	323362	( See fig. 7 . ) 
15087	br-h15	4	15	323368	Building plans are on page 21 . 
15088	br-h15	5	16	323375	Solid concrete blocks , relatively heavy and dense , are used for this shelter . 
15089	br-h15	5	17	323390	These blocks are sold in various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit . 
15090	br-h15	6	18	323409	Solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have_to be filled with concrete to give effective protection . 
15091	br-h15	7	19	323427	Bricks are an alternative . 
15092	br-h15	7	20	323432	If they are used , the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the 8 - inch solid concrete blocks . 
15093	br-h15	8	21	323460	The illustrations in fig. 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall . 
15094	br-h15	8	22	323474	More detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building_supply_houses and craftsmen . 
15095	br-h15	8	23	323487	Other sources of information include the National_Concrete_Masonry_Association , 38 South_Dearborn_Street , Chicago , Ill. , the Portland_Cement_Association , 33 West_Grand_Avenue , Chicago , Ill. , and the Structural_Clay_Products_Association , Washington , D._C. . 
15096	br-h15	9	24	323520	An outdoor , aboveground fallout_shelter also may be built with concrete blocks . 
15097	br-h15	9	25	323533	( See fig. 9 , double wall shelter . ) 
15098	br-h15	9	26	323543	Most people would have_to hire a contractor to build this shelter . 
15099	br-h15	9	27	323555	Plans are on pages 22 and 23 . 
15100	br-h15	10	28	323563	This shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface , making it impractical to build an underground shelter . 
15101	br-h15	11	29	323589	Two walls of concrete blocks are constructed at_least 20 inches apart . 
15102	br-h15	11	30	323601	The space between them is filled with pit-run gravel or earth . 
15103	br-h15	11	31	323613	The walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built . 
15104	br-h15	12	32	323632	The roof shown here ( fig. 9 ) is a 6 - inch slab of reinforced_concrete , covered with at_least 20 inches of pit-run gravel . 
15105	br-h15	12	33	323658	An alternate roof , perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach , could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams , overlaid with boards and waterproofing . 
15106	br-h15	12	34	323683	It would have_to be covered with at_least 28 inches of pit-run gravel . 
15107	br-h15	13	35	323696	The materials for a double wall shelter would cost about $ 700 . 
15108	br-h15	13	36	323709	Contractors ' charges would be additional . 
15109	br-h15	13	37	323716	The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection . 
15110	br-h15	14	38	323725	Pre shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground . 
15111	br-h15	14	39	323744	These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface . 
15112	br-h15	14	40	323760	They form effective fallout_shelters when mounded_over with earth , as shown in figure 10 . 
15113	br-h15	15	41	323775	Materials for this shelter would cost about $ 700 . 
15114	br-h15	15	42	323785	A contractor probably would be required to help build it . 
15115	br-h15	15	43	323796	His charges would be added to the cost of materials . 
15116	br-h15	15	44	323807	This shelter , as shown on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation . 
15117	br-h15	15	45	323825	An alternate hatchway entrance , shown on page 25 , would reduce the cost of materials $ 50 to $ 100 . 
15118	br-h15	16	46	323847	The National_Lumber_Manufacturers_Association , Washington , D._C. , is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction . 
15119	br-h15	16	47	323867	The Structural_Clay_Products_Institute , Washington , D._C. , is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction . 
15120	br-h15	17	48	323887	An underground reinforced_concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about $ 1000 to $ 1500 , depending_on the type of entrance . 
15121	br-h15	17	49	323911	The shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection . 
15122	br-h15	18	50	323921	The illustration ( fig. 11 ) shows this shelter with the roof at ground_level and mounded_over . 
15123	br-h15	18	51	323938	The same shelter could be built into an embankment or below ground_level . 
15124	br-h15	18	52	323951	Plans for the shelter , with either a stairway or hatchway entrance , are shown on pages 26 and 27 . 
15125	br-h15	19	53	323972	Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction . 
15126	br-h15	19	54	323997	It would add about $ 500 to the total cost of the home . 
15127	br-h15	19	55	324011	The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the Washington , D._C. area in the Spring of 1959 . 
15128	br-h15	20	56	324040	Important considerations common to each type of shelter are : 
15129	br-h15	21	57	324050	Arrangement of the entrance . 
15130	br-h15	22	58	324055	Ventilation . 
15131	br-h15	23	59	324057	Radio reception . 
15132	br-h15	24	60	324060	Lighting . 
15133	br-h15	25	61	324062	The entrance must have at_least one right-angle turn . 
15134	br-h15	25	62	324071	Radiation scatters somewhat like light . 
15135	br-h15	25	63	324077	Some will go around a corner . 
15136	br-h15	25	64	324084	The rest continues in a straight_line . 
15137	br-h15	25	65	324091	Therefore , sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter . 
15138	br-h15	26	66	324107	Ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance . 
15139	br-h15	26	67	324127	A blower may be installed to increase comfort . 
15140	br-h15	27	68	324136	A blower is essential for the double wall shelter and for the underground shelters . 
15141	br-h15	27	69	324151	It should provide not less_than 5 cubic_feet per minute of air per person . 
15142	br-h15	27	70	324165	Vent pipes also are necessary ( as shown in figs. 9 , 10 , and 11 ) , but filters are not . 
15143	br-h15	28	71	324188	Radio reception is cut_down by the shielding necessary to keep_out radiation . 
15144	br-h15	28	72	324200	As_soon_as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made . 
15145	br-h15	28	73	324213	It probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna , particularly to receive CONELRAD broadcasts . 
15146	br-h15	29	74	324230	Lighting is an important consideration . 
15147	br-h15	29	75	324236	Continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the shelter by_means_of a 4 - cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150 - milliampere flashlight type bulb . 
15148	br-h15	29	76	324264	Tests have shown that such a device , with a fresh battery , will furnish light continuously for at_least 10 days . 
15149	br-h15	29	77	324286	With a spare battery , a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured . 
15150	br-h15	29	78	324304	A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed . 
15151	br-h15	29	79	324323	There should be a regular electrical_outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas . 
15152	br-h15	30	80	324340	Other considerations . 
15153	br-h15	30	81	324343	- If there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter , they should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29 . 
15154	br-h15	30	82	324372	Other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens . 
15155	br-h15	30	83	324383	Basement walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29 . 
15156	br-h15	31	84	324402	In these shelters the entrance should be not more_than 2 feet wide . 
15157	br-h15	31	85	324415	Bunks , or materials to build them , may have_to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed . 
15158	br-h15	32	86	324437	The basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection . 
15159	br-h15	33	87	324451	The radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at_first . 
15160	br-h15	33	88	324459	Forty-nine hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion . 
15161	br-h15	33	89	324483	But the radiation may be so intense at_the_start that one_percent may be extremely dangerous . 
15162	br-h15	34	90	324498	Therefore , civil_defense instructions received over CONELRAD or by other means should be followed . 
15163	br-h15	34	91	324513	A battery powered radio is essential . 
15164	br-h15	34	92	324520	Radiation instruments suitable for home use are available , and would be of_value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation . 
15165	br-h15	34	93	324549	There is a possibility that battery powered radios with built-in radiation meters may become available . 
15166	br-h15	34	94	324565	One instrument thus would serve both purposes . 
15167	br-h15	35	95	324573	Your local civil_defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from State and Federal sources . 
15168	br-h15	35	96	324592	It will tell you as_soon_as possible : 
15169	br-h15	36	97	324599	How long to stay in your shelter . 
15170	br-h15	37	98	324607	How soon you may go outdoors . 
15171	br-h15	38	99	324614	How long you may stay outside . 
15172	br-h15	39	100	324621	You should be prepared to stay in your shelter full_time for at_least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer . 
15173	br-h15	39	101	324647	A checklist in the Appendix , ( page 30 ) tells what is needed . 
15174	br-h15	39	102	324662	Families with children will have particular problems . 
15175	br-h15	39	103	324670	They should provide_for simple recreation . 
15176	br-h15	40	104	324676	There should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated . 
15177	br-h15	40	105	324690	Part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake . 
15178	br-h15	41	106	324703	To break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy . 
15179	br-h15	41	107	324721	Records such_as diaries can be kept . 
15180	br-h15	42	108	324728	The survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio . 
15181	br-h15	42	109	324742	A record should be kept of the information and instructions , including the time and date of broadcast . 
15182	br-h15	43	110	324761	Family rationing probably will be necessary . 
15183	br-h15	44	111	324768	Blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule . 
15184	br-h15	44	112	324778	There will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement . 
15185	br-h15	44	113	324801	However , as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum . 
15186	br-h15	45	114	324822	The housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as_soon_as the shelter is occupied . 
15187	br-h15	45	115	324838	Food , medical supplies , utensils , and equipment , if not already stored in the shelter , must be quickly gathered_up and carried into it . 
15188	br-h15	46	116	324865	After the family has settled in the shelter , the housekeeping rules should be spelled_out by the adult in charge . 
15189	br-h15	47	117	324886	Sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning . 
15190	br-h15	48	118	324901	Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human_wastes will be an unfamiliar problem . 
15191	br-h15	48	119	324916	A covered container such_as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet . 
15192	br-h15	48	120	324930	A 10 - gallon garbage_can , with a tightly_fitting cover , could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter . 
15193	br-h15	49	121	324957	Water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully . 
15194	br-h15	50	122	324968	A portable electric_heater is advisable for shelters in cold climates . 
15195	br-h15	50	123	324979	It would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning . 
15196	br-h15	50	124	324991	Even if the electric_power fails after an attack , any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that_much more comfortable . 
15197	br-h15	50	125	325016	Body heat in the close quarters will help keep_up the temperature . 
15198	br-h15	50	126	325028	Warm clothing and bedding , of_course , are essential . 
15199	br-h15	51	127	325038	Open flame heating or cooking should be avoided . 
15200	br-h15	51	128	325047	A flame would use_up air . 
15201	br-h15	52	129	325053	Some families already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need . 
15202	br-h15	53	130	325079	Few areas , if any , are as_good_as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about . 
15203	br-h15	54	131	325096	A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation . 
15204	br-h15	54	132	325110	On the ground_floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside . 
15205	br-h15	54	133	325124	The best protection would be on the ground_floor in the central part of the house . 
15206	br-h15	55	134	325140	A belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one tenth of the outside level . 
15207	br-h15	55	135	325156	The safest place is the basement corner least exposed to windows and deepest below ground . 
15208	br-h15	56	136	325172	If there is time after the warning , the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking windows with bricks , dirt , books , magazines , or other heavy material . 
15209	br-h15	57	137	325204	Large apartment_buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings . 
15210	br-h15	57	138	325220	In_general , such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space . 
15211	br-h15	58	139	325241	The central area of the ground_floor of a heavily constructed apartment_building , with concrete floors , should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling . 
15212	br-h15	58	140	325271	The basement of such an apartment_building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling . 
15213	br-h15	59	141	325299	The Federal_Government is aiding local_governments in several places to survey residential , commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout protection they would provide , and for how many people . 
15214	br-h15	60	142	325330	The problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space . 
15215	br-h15	60	143	325347	Such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management . 
15216	br-h16	1	1	325362	A former du_Pont official became a General_Motors vice_president and set_about maximizing du_Pont 's share of the General_Motors market . 
15217	br-h16	1	2	325381	Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several du_Pont products were actively promoted . 
15218	br-h16	1	3	325398	Within a_few years various du_Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General_Motors ' eight operating divisions . 
15219	br-h16	1	4	325422	The Fisher_Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting_trust even though General_Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from du_Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General_Motors divisions . 
15220	br-h16	1	5	325479	Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General_Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at_least in part '' from the needs of General_Motors outstripping du_Pont 's capacity . 
15221	br-h16	1	6	325517	`` The fact that sticks_out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du_Pont 's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile_industry connected to du_Pont by a stock interest . 
15222	br-h16	1	7	325558	The inference is overwhelming that du_Pont 's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' . 
15223	br-h16	1	8	325583	353_U._S._,_at_605 . 
15224	br-h16	2	9	325585	This Court agreed with the trial_court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not overlooked by either du_Pont or General_Motors '' . 
15225	br-h16	2	10	325610	353_U._S._,_at_606 . 
15226	br-h16	2	11	325612	However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including du_Pont 's competitors '' , 353_U._S._,_at_607 , outweighed the Government 's claim for relief . 
15227	br-h16	2	12	325681	This claim , as submitted to the District_Court and dismissed by it , 126_F._Supp .235 , alleged violation not_only of 7 of the Clayton_Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman_Act . 
15228	br-h16	2	13	325716	The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . 
15229	br-h16	2	14	325752	However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government 's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman_Act allegations . 
15230	br-h16	2	15	325774	It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` [ N_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . 
15231	br-h16	3	16	325872	This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempting to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . 
15232	br-h16	4	17	325910	The purpose of_this provision was thus explained in the Court 's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . 
15233	br-h16	4	18	326008	The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended '' . 
15234	br-h16	4	19	326034	353_U._S._,_at_589 . 
15235	br-h16	5	20	326036	Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision . 
15236	br-h16	5	21	326057	Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du_Pont and General_Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . 
15237	br-h16	5	22	326105	This , however , did not bar finding that du_Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General_Motors ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton_Act ; that General_Motors ' share of the market for these products was substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : 
15238	br-h16	5	23	326179	`` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute . 
15239	br-h16	5	24	326217	We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . 
15240	br-h16	5	25	326254	The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition '' . 
15241	br-h16	5	26	326272	353_U._S._,_at_607 . 
15242	br-h16	6	27	326274	On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion , the Court remanded the case to the District_Court to determine the appropriate relief . 
15243	br-h16	6	28	326300	The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this : `` The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District_Court for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute . 
15244	br-h16	6	29	326361	The District_Courts , in the framing of equitable decrees , are clothed ' with large discretion to model their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case ' .

15246	br-h16	6	31	326394	353_U._S._,_at_607_-_608 . 
15247	br-h16	7	32	326396	This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District_Court . 
15248	br-h16	8	33	326409	This Court 's judgment was filed in the District_Court on July 18 , 1957 . 
15249	br-h16	8	34	326424	The first pretrial conference - held to appoint amici_curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of du_Pont and General_Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings - took_place on September 25 , 1957 . 
15250	br-h16	8	35	326464	At the outset , the Government 's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for du_Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court . 
15251	br-h16	8	36	326504	Du_Pont , he said , had proposed disenfranchisement of its General_Motors stock along with other restrictions on the du_Pont-General_Motors relationship . 
15252	br-h16	8	37	326525	The Government , deeming these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du_Pont 's shares of General_Motors . 
15253	br-h16	8	38	326547	Counsel for the Government invited du_Pont 's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if counsel for du_Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days . 
15254	br-h16	9	39	326597	Counsel for du_Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early date . 
15255	br-h16	9	40	326617	No previous antitrust_case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief . 
15256	br-h16	9	41	326638	The submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract . 
15257	br-h16	9	42	326663	The Court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out . 
15258	br-h16	10	43	326678	The Government submitted its proposed decree on October 25 , 1957 . 
15259	br-h16	10	44	326690	The plan called_for divestiture by du_Pont of its 63000000 shares of General_Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders , as a dividend , over a period of ten years . 
15260	br-h16	10	45	326722	Christiana_Securities_Company and Delaware_Realty_+_Investment_Company , major stockholders in du_Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten year period , of du_Pont 's General_Motors stock allocable to them , as_well_as any General_Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright . 
15261	br-h16	10	46	326777	If , in the trustee 's judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten year period . 
15262	br-h16	10	47	326818	In_addition , the right_to_vote the General_Motors stock held by du_Pont was to be vested in du_Pont 's stockholders , other_than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General_Motors ; du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in_common with General_Motors , and vice_versa ; and General_Motors and du_Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided_for the purchase by General_Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du_Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent_rights , or for a grant by General_Motors to du_Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General_Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial_enterprise by the two companies . 
15263	br-h16	11	48	326964	On motion of the amici_curiae , the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner_of_Internal_Revenue as to the federal income_tax consequences of the Government 's plan . 
15264	br-h16	11	49	326993	On May 9 , 1958 , the Commissioner announced his rulings . 
15265	br-h16	11	50	327005	The annual dividends paid to du_Pont stockholders in shares of General_Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of du_Pont 's earnings and profits . 
15266	br-h16	11	51	327033	The measure , for federal income_tax purposes , of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market_value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution . 
15267	br-h16	11	52	327063	In the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders , the measure would be the lesser of the fair market_value of the shares or du_Pont 's tax basis for them , which is approximately $ 2.09 per share . 
15268	br-h16	11	53	327100	The forced_sale of the General_Motors stock owned by or allocable to Christiana , Delaware , and the stockholders of Delaware , and deposited with the trustee , would result in a tax to those parties at the capital_gains rate . 
15269	br-h16	12	54	327140	Du_Pont 's counterproposal was filed on May 14 , 1958 . 
15270	br-h16	12	55	327151	Under its plan du_Pont would retain its General_Motors shares but be required to pass_on to its stockholders the right_to_vote those shares . 
15271	br-h16	12	56	327173	Christiana and Delaware would , in_turn , be required to pass_on the voting_rights to the General_Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders . 
15272	br-h16	12	57	327198	Du_Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General_Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of du_Pont could serve as a director of General_Motors without court approval . 
15273	br-h16	12	58	327244	Du_Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General_Motors stock except through General_Motors ' distributions of stock or subscription_rights to its stockholders . 
15274	br-h16	13	59	327269	On June 6 , 1958 , General_Motors submitted its objections to the Government 's proposal . 
15275	br-h16	13	60	327285	It argued , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both General_Motors and du_Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; that the tremendous volume of General_Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General_Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . 
15276	br-h16	13	61	327407	General_Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the mandate of_this Court . 
15277	br-h16	14	62	327430	The decrees proposed by the amici_curiae were filed in August of 1958 . 
15278	br-h16	14	63	327443	These plans , like du_Pont 's contained provisions for passing the vote on du_Pont 's General_Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as_well_as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised . 
15279	br-h16	14	64	327505	Both plans also prohibited common directors , officers , or employees between du_Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , on_the_one_hand , and General_Motors on_the_other . 
15280	br-h17	1	1	327530	It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . 
15281	br-h17	1	2	327578	While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins ' pronouncement in Pleas_of_the_Crown from a metaphysical point_of_view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married_couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such_that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal_law as if there were no marriage . 
15282	br-h17	2	3	327637	By making inroads in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt_v._United_States , 362_U._S._525 , where the Court held that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . 
15283	br-h17	2	4	327699	One need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . 
15284	br-h17	2	5	327735	One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . 
15285	br-h17	2	6	327748	The Court 's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of law '' . 
15286	br-h17	2	7	327786	I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed . 
15287	br-h17	2	8	327809	But in_any_event , I submit that the power to depose belongs_to Congress , not to this Court . 
15288	br-h17	2	9	327827	I dissent . 
15289	br-h17	2	10	327830	Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious_objector , was convicted of violating 12 ( a ) of the Universal_Military_Training_and_Service_Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed_forces . 
15290	br-h17	2	11	327859	He claims that he was denied due_process_of_law in violation of the Fifth_Amendment , because ( 1 ) at a hearing before a hearing_officer of the Department_of_Justice_, he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was denied the right to have the hearing_officer 's report and the original report of the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation as to his claim . 
15291	br-h17	2	12	327931	Held : On the record in this case , the administrative procedures prescribed by the Act were fully complied with ; petitioner was not denied due_process ; and his conviction is sustained . 
15292	br-h17	2	13	327964	Pp. 60 - 66 . 
15293	br-h17	3	14	327969	Petitioner was not denied due_process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in_question was in his file , to which he had access , and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing_officer of the Department_of_Justice and before the appeal_board . 
15294	br-h17	3	15	328013	Pp. 62 - 63 . 
15295	br-h17	4	16	328018	Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing_officer 's notes and report , especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the Department_of_Justice 's recommendation to the appeal_board . 
15296	br-h17	4	17	328057	Pp. 63 - 64 . 
15297	br-h17	5	18	328062	Petitioner was not entitled , either in the administrative hearing at the Department_of_Justice or at his trial , to inspect the original report of the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation , since he was furnished a resume of it , did not challenge its accuracy , and showed no particular need for the original report . 
15298	br-h17	5	19	328114	Pp. 64 - 66 . 
15299	br-h17	6	20	328119	Haydn_C._Covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner . 
15300	br-h17	7	21	328130	Daniel_M._Friedman argued the cause for the United_States . 
15301	br-h17	7	22	328138	On the brief were Solicitor_General_Rankin , Assistant_Attorney_General_Wilkey , Beatrice_Rosenberg and J._F._Bishop . 
15302	br-h17	8	23	328150	Mr._Justice_Clark delivered the opinion of the Court . 
15303	br-h17	9	24	328158	This is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the armed_services , in violation of the provisions of the Universal_Military_Training_and_Service_Act , 62_Stat._604_,_622_,_50_U._S._C._App._462_(_a ) . 
15304	br-h17	9	25	328183	Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious_objector , contends that he was denied due_process , both in the proceedings before a hearing_officer of the Department_of_Justice and at trial . 
15305	br-h17	9	26	328213	He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing_officer statements attributed to him by the local board , and , further , that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department_of_Justice hearing_officer 's report and the original report of the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation as to his claim - all in violation of the Fifth_Amendment . 
15306	br-h17	9	27	328272	The trial_judge decided that the administrative procedures of the Act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents . 
15307	br-h17	9	28	328296	Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months ' imprisonment . 
15308	br-h17	9	29	328308	The Court_of_Appeals affirmed . 
15309	br-h17	9	30	328312	269_F._2_d_613 . 
15310	br-h17	9	31	328314	We granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the Act . 
15311	br-h17	9	32	328332	361_U._S._899 . 
15312	br-h17	9	33	328334	We have concluded that petitioner 's claims are controlled by the rationale of gonzales_v._United_States , 348_U._S._407_(_1955_) , and United_States_v._Nugent , 346_U._S .1_(_1953 ) , and therefore affirm the judgment . 
15313	br-h17	10	34	328364	Petitioner registered with Local_Board_No._9 , Boulder_,_Colorado , on March 17 , 1952 . 
15314	br-h17	10	35	328377	His answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of Jehovah's_Witnesses , employed at night by a sugar producer . 
15315	br-h17	10	36	328400	He claimed 4_,_-_D classification as a minister of religion , devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching . 
15316	br-h17	10	37	328421	On November 13 , 1952 , he was classified in Class 1 , -_A . 
15317	br-h17	10	38	328436	On November 22 , 1952 , he wrote the Board , protesting this classification . 
15318	br-h17	10	39	328451	He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in_addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties , and that he opposed war in any form . 
15319	br-h17	10	40	328501	Thereafter he was classified 1_,_-_O . 
15320	br-h17	10	41	328507	On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board . 
15321	br-h17	10	42	328542	In a periodic review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1_,_-_A and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home . 
15322	br-h17	10	43	328584	Upon administrative approval of the reclassification , he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so . 
15323	br-h17	10	44	328610	He was not prosecuted , however , and his case was subsequently reopened , in the light of Sicurella_v._United_States , 348_U._S._385_(_1955_) . 
15324	br-h17	10	45	328632	He was again reclassified 1_,_-_A by the local board . 
15325	br-h17	10	46	328642	There followed a customary Department_of_Justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared . 
15326	br-h17	10	47	328654	In his report to the Attorney_General , the hearing_officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service . 
15327	br-h17	10	48	328676	On March 21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the 1_,_-_A classification . 
15328	br-h17	10	49	328693	Its ground for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the Jehovah's_Witnesses reported that he was no_longer doing so and , on_the_contrary , had relinquished both his Pioneer_and_Bible_Student_Servant positions . 
15329	br-h17	10	50	328761	It reported that he now devoted only some 6 - 1_2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities . 
15330	br-h17	10	51	328790	His claim was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' , the Department concluded , that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and , consequently , upon his sincerity and good_faith '' . 
15331	br-h17	10	52	328823	The appeal_board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation . 
15332	br-h17	10	53	328833	In his answer thereto , he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim to `` pioneering '' was in 1952 . 
15333	br-h17	10	54	328866	The appeal_board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department 's recommendation . 
15334	br-h17	10	55	328879	Upon return of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so . 
15335	br-h17	11	56	328907	Petitioner first contends that the Department denied him procedural due_process by not giving him timely opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal_board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching . 
15336	br-h17	11	57	328952	But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file . 
15337	br-h17	11	58	328969	He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times , and he could have rebutted it before the hearing_officer . 
15338	br-h17	11	59	328993	This he failed to do , asserting that he did not know it to be in his file . 
15339	br-h17	11	60	329012	Apparently he never took the trouble to find_out . 
15340	br-h17	11	61	329021	Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal_board . 
15341	br-h17	11	62	329034	After the recommendation of the Department is forwarded to the appeal_board , that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial . 
15342	br-h17	11	63	329059	This he did . 
15343	br-h17	11	64	329063	We found in Gonzales_v._United_States , supra , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant . 
15344	br-h17	11	65	329087	We said there that it was necessary `` that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut [ the Department 's ] recommendation when it comes to the Appeal_Board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' . 
15345	br-h17	11	66	329127	348_U._S._,_at_412 . 
15346	br-h17	11	67	329129	We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner 's contention , which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it . 
15347	br-h17	11	68	329157	As was said in Gonzales , `` it is the Appeal_Board which renders the selective_service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact . 
15348	br-h17	11	69	329193	Estep_v._United_States , 327_U._S._114_'' . 
15349	br-h17	11	70	329197	348_U._S._,_at_412_-_413 . 
15350	br-h17	12	71	329199	But there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult . 
15351	br-h17	12	72	329211	At his trial , petitioner sought to secure through subpoena_duces_tecum the longhand notes of the Department 's hearing_officer , Evensen , as_well as his report thereon . 
15352	br-h17	12	73	329238	Petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation reports to the Department_of_Justice . 
15353	br-h17	12	74	329255	He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld ; nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation reports might disclose . 
15354	br-h17	13	75	329279	Section 6_(_j_) of the Act , as we have held , does require the Department 's recommendation to be placed in a registrant 's file . 
15355	br-h17	13	76	329305	Gonzales_v._United_States , supra . 
15356	br-h17	13	77	329309	But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing_officer 's report to be likewise turned_over to the registrant . 
15357	br-h17	13	78	329329	While the regulations formerly required that the hearing_officer 's report be placed in the registrant 's file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 . 
15358	br-h17	13	79	329354	Moreover , the hearing_officer 's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney_General and , of_course , is not the recommendation of the Department . 
15359	br-h17	13	80	329381	It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department_of_Justice , of which the Attorney_General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection . 
15360	br-h17	13	81	329414	It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes_into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board . 
15361	br-h17	14	82	329438	It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing_officer 's notes were furnished to the appeal board . 
15362	br-h17	14	83	329458	Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board . 
15363	br-h17	14	84	329478	Petitioner knew that the Department 's recommendation was based not on the hearing_officer 's report but on the statement of the local board in his file . 
15364	br-h17	14	85	329505	Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing_officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due_process because he did not succeed . 
15365	br-h17	15	86	329541	It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing_officer 's report and notes at the trial . 
15366	br-h17	15	87	329564	In_addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . 
15367	br-h17	15	88	329580	While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process . 
15368	br-h17	15	89	329624	Moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts . 
15369	br-h17	15	90	329636	In the light of these circumstances , as_well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department 's recommendation , which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing_officer 's report and notes . 
15370	br-h17	16	91	329694	Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing_officer as_well as at the trial . 
15371	br-h17	16	92	329718	He did receive a resume of it - the same that was furnished the appeal board - and he made no claim of its inaccuracy . 
15372	br-h17	16	93	329744	Even now no such claim is asserted . 
15373	br-h17	16	94	329752	He bases his present contention on the general right to explore , indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume . 
15374	br-h17	16	95	329776	But this is fully answered by United_States_v._Nugent , supra . 
15375	br-h17	16	96	329786	There we held `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective_service_system , entitles [ conscientious_objectors ] to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for their inspection '' . 
15376	br-h17	16	97	329820	346_U._S._,_at_5_-_6 . 
15377	br-h17	16	98	329822	Even if we were not bound by Nugent , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report . 
15378	br-h17	16	99	329841	The recommendation of the Department - as_well as the decision of the appeal board - was based entirely on the local board file , not on an FBI report . 
15379	br-h18	1	1	329871	With this enlarged role in mind , I should_like to make a_few suggestions : What we in the United_States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world . 
15380	br-h18	1	2	329911	We in this Department must think_about foreign_policy in its total context . 
15381	br-h18	1	3	329923	We cannot regard foreign_policy as something left_over after defense_policy or trade_policy or fiscal_policy has been extracted . 
15382	br-h18	1	4	329940	Foreign_policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad . 
15383	br-h18	1	5	329955	That means that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in_terms_of the total context of our situation . 
15384	br-h18	1	6	329981	It is the concern of the Department_of_State that the American people are safe and secure - defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department_of_Defense . 
15385	br-h18	1	7	330007	It is also the concern of the Department_of_State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active - this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department_of_Commerce . 
15386	br-h18	1	8	330050	We can no_longer rely_on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments . 
15387	br-h18	1	9	330069	Assistant_Secretaries_of_State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies . 
15388	br-h18	1	10	330084	Means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign_policy . 
15389	br-h18	2	11	330112	I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action . 
15390	br-h18	2	12	330126	Every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer . 
15391	br-h18	2	13	330137	Unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present . 
15392	br-h18	2	14	330159	The movement of events is so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present . 
15393	br-h18	2	15	330192	If there is anything which we can do in the executive_branch of the Government to speed_up the processes by which we come_to decisions on matters on_which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs . 
15394	br-h18	2	16	330238	Action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control . 
15395	br-h18	3	17	330262	There will of_course be times for delay and inaction . 
15396	br-h18	3	18	330272	What I am suggesting is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties . 
15397	br-h18	4	19	330304	I also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant_mortality_rate of ideas - an affliction of all bureaucracies . 
15398	br-h18	4	20	330325	We want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department . 
15399	br-h18	4	21	330340	We want to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome , that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all_the_way to the top . 
15400	br-h18	4	22	330370	I hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked_upon as sources of ideas . 
15401	br-h18	4	23	330386	The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function , regardless of rank . 
15402	br-h18	5	24	330413	Further , I would hope that we could pay_attention to little things . 
15403	br-h18	5	25	330426	While observing the operations of our Government in various parts of the world , I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort . 
15404	br-h18	5	26	330465	To cite only a_few examples : 
15405	br-h18	5	27	330471	The wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; the attitudes of a U.N. delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New_York_City , or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstances in our Capital , can be easily be directed against the United_States and all that it stands_for . 
15406	br-h18	5	28	330540	Dozens of seemingly small matters go_wrong all_over the world . 
15407	br-h18	5	29	330550	Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them . 
15408	br-h18	5	30	330571	I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come_across little things going_wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them . 
15409	br-h18	6	31	330610	If the Department_of_State is to take primary responsibility for foreign_policy in Washington , it follows that the ambassador is expected to take_charge overseas . 
15410	br-h18	6	32	330634	This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion . 
15411	br-h18	6	33	330655	He is expected to know about what is going_on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country . 
15412	br-h18	6	34	330677	He is expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can . 
15413	br-h18	6	35	330697	If any official operation abroad begins to go_wrong , we shall look_to the ambassador to find_out why and to get suggestions for remedial action . 
15414	br-h18	7	36	330722	It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed privately in recent years , in the hope of clearing_up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign_policy is all about and what it means , and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government . 
15415	br-h18	7	37	330781	I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces . 
15416	br-h18	7	38	330803	This means practically everybody in this room . 
15417	br-h18	7	39	330811	Whether it will strike_home for you or not will be for you to determine . 
15418	br-h18	8	40	330826	The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a colleague , a question from the Secretary or the President , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the agenda of the United_Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies , a news_item read at the breakfast_table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news_conference , a speech by a Senator or Congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et_cetera , ad_infinitum . 
15419	br-h18	8	41	330964	The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility . 
15420	br-h18	9	42	330983	His first thought is about the question itself : 
15421	br-h18	9	43	330992	Is there a question here for American foreign_policy , and , if so , what is it ? 
15422	br-h18	9	44	331010	For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is - that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself , and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer . 
15423	br-h18	10	45	331054	Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a tentative identification of the question - tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because , if no tolerable answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered . 
15424	br-h18	11	46	331109	Meanwhile he has been thinking_about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to history . 
15425	br-h18	11	47	331144	He is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play , taking_care to examine at_least some of the raw_material which underlies their frequently policy oriented conclusions . 
15426	br-h18	11	48	331177	He knows that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it . 
15427	br-h18	12	49	331200	He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing . 
15428	br-h18	12	50	331218	He knows that he is thinking_about action in_relation_to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog . 
15429	br-h18	12	51	331239	But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy , well established precedents , the commitments of the United_States under international charters and treaties , basic statutes , and well understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such_as country papers and National_Security_Council papers accumulated in the Department . 
15430	br-h18	13	52	331299	He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted . 
15431	br-h18	13	53	331322	He must think_about which of these principles must take precedence . 
15432	br-h18	13	54	331333	He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance . 
15433	br-h18	13	55	331355	He is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem . 
15434	br-h18	13	56	331370	He must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation_to the whole - when the whole is too_large to grasp . 
15435	br-h18	14	57	331400	He must think_of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer . 
15436	br-h18	14	58	331416	Who should be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government ? 
15437	br-h18	14	59	331435	Which American ambassadors could provide helpful advice ? 
15438	br-h18	14	60	331443	Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted ? 
15439	br-h18	14	61	331452	What is the probable attitude of other governments , including those less directly involved ? 
15440	br-h18	14	62	331467	How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted ? 
15441	br-h18	15	63	331483	If action is indicated , what kind of action is relevant to the problem ? 
15442	br-h18	15	64	331498	The selection of the wrong tools can mean waste , at_best , and at_worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself . 
15443	br-h18	15	65	331520	Can the President or the Secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ? 
15444	br-h18	15	66	331541	Should the action be unilateral or multilateral ? 
15445	br-h18	15	67	331549	Is the matter one for the United_Nations or some_other international body ? 
15446	br-h18	15	68	331561	For , if so , the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem . 
15447	br-h18	16	69	331585	What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? 
15448	br-h18	16	70	331604	For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in_general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it . 
15449	br-h18	16	71	331637	He is interested in public opinion for two reasons : 
15450	br-h18	16	72	331647	first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind . 
15451	br-h18	16	73	331678	And , given probable public attitudes - about which reasonably good estimates can be made - what action is called_for to insure necessary support ? 
15452	br-h18	17	74	331703	May I add a caution on this particular point ? 
15453	br-h18	17	75	331713	We do not want policy officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves too_much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign_policy action . 
15454	br-h18	17	76	331739	In_the_first_place our business is foreign_policy , and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem . 
15455	br-h18	17	77	331770	Mr._Truman emphasized this point by saying , `` You fellows in the Department_of_State do n't know much about domestic politics '' . 
15456	br-h18	18	78	331792	This is an important consideration . 
15457	br-h18	18	79	331798	If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public_opinion_polls and other reports that cross our desks , we should realize that this is raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership . 
15458	br-h18	18	80	331833	What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership . 
15459	br-h18	18	81	331847	We cannot test public_opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action . 
15460	br-h18	18	82	331881	I doubt , for_example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk_about what came to be the Marshall_plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals . 
15461	br-h18	19	83	331918	The problem in the policy officer 's mind thus begins to take_shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors - political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative - to be sorted_out and handled within a political_system which moves by consent in_relation_to an external environment which cannot be under_control . 
15462	br-h18	20	84	331975	And the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping_at_his_heels . 
15463	br-h21	1	1	331986	Strategy and tactics of the U._S. military_forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history . 
15464	br-h21	1	2	332004	The change of emphasis from conventional type to missile type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other . 
15465	br-h21	1	3	332038	Our military_forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war . 
15466	br-h21	2	4	332065	- This budget will provide in the fiscal_year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level - a year-end strength of 2489000 men and women in the active forces . 
15467	br-h21	2	5	332100	The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870000 men ; a Navy of 817 active ships and 619000 men ; a Marine_Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175000 men ; and an Air_Force of 91 combat wings and 825000 men . 
15468	br-h21	3	6	332149	If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must conform_to the changing character and missions of the active forces . 
15469	br-h21	3	7	332179	Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers . 
15470	br-h21	3	8	332190	Under modern conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve . 
15471	br-h21	3	9	332203	I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in_relation_to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare . 
15472	br-h21	4	10	332238	Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army_Reserve . 
15473	br-h21	4	11	332254	Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National_Guard contained in the 1960 Department_of_Defense Appropriation_Act should likewise be dropped . 
15474	br-h21	4	12	332274	I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . 
15475	br-h21	5	13	332308	I again proposed a reduction in the Army National_Guard and Army_Reserve - from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . 
15476	br-h21	5	14	332343	These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives . 
15477	br-h21	6	15	332366	- About 30 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense in 1961 are for military_personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . 
15478	br-h21	6	16	332394	These expenditures are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social_security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) . 
15479	br-h21	6	17	332454	Retired pay costs are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . 
15480	br-h21	6	18	332481	These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army_Reserve components during 1961 . 
15481	br-h21	7	19	332516	Traditionally , rates_of_pay for retired military_personnel have been proportionate to current rates_of_pay for active personnel . 
15482	br-h21	7	20	332532	The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing_for a 6 % increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958 . 
15483	br-h21	7	21	332567	I endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay_rates . 
15484	br-h21	8	22	332584	- Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed_Forces are estimated to be $ 10.3 billion in 1961 , which is $ 184 million more than in 1960 . 
15485	br-h21	8	23	332617	The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment . 
15486	br-h21	9	24	332638	A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications_systems in the air defense_program , as_well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential . 
15487	br-h21	9	25	332669	Also , the program for fleet modernization will be stepped_up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures . 
15488	br-h21	9	26	332687	Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year . 
15489	br-h21	10	27	332703	Other factors increasing operating_costs include the higher unit_cost of each flying hour , up 11 % in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15 % . 
15490	br-h21	10	28	332733	In total , these increases in operating_costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such_as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed_Forces . 
15491	br-h21	11	29	332779	In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) . 
15492	br-h21	11	30	332812	This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying_out certain transactions involving real_property unless they come into agreement with the Committees_on_Armed_Services of the Senate and the House_of_Representatives . 
15493	br-h21	11	31	332847	As I have stated previously , the Attorney_General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles . 
15494	br-h21	11	32	332866	Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise . 
15495	br-h21	12	33	332907	Basic long line communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army , Air_Force , and Federal_Aviation_Agency . 
15496	br-h21	12	34	332929	The growing communications needs of this new State can best be met , as they have in other States , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise . 
15497	br-h21	12	35	332961	Legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these Government owned systems in Alaska , and its early enactment is desirable . 
15498	br-h21	13	36	332985	- Approximately 45 % of the expenditures for the Department_of_Defense are for procurement , research , development , and construction programs . 
15499	br-h21	13	37	333007	In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at $ 18.9 billion , compared to $ 19.3 billion in 1960 . 
15500	br-h21	13	38	333027	The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such_as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic_devices . 
15501	br-h21	13	39	333067	Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 . 
15502	br-h21	14	40	333081	New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) totals $ 4753 million , which is $ 1390 million below that enacted for 1960 . 
15503	br-h21	14	41	333118	On_the_other_hand , the new authority of $ 3825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $ 581 million higher than for 1960 . 
15504	br-h21	14	42	333148	These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed_Forces in the years ahead . 
15505	br-h21	15	43	333170	The Department_of_Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items . 
15506	br-h21	15	44	333198	As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known_as the Buy American Act . 
15507	br-h21	15	45	333222	I urge once_again that the Congress not reenact this rider . 
15508	br-h21	16	46	333233	The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without endangering other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress . 
15509	br-h21	16	47	333264	The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history . 
15510	br-h21	16	48	333284	Some weapons_systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development . 
15511	br-h21	17	49	333301	Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon_system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems . 
15512	br-h21	17	50	333328	This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons_systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_systems which have been overtaken by events . 
15513	br-h21	17	51	333365	Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated . 
15514	br-h21	17	52	333394	For_example , the importance of the Regulus_2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic_missile launched by submerged submarines . 
15515	br-h21	18	53	333438	Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long range interceptor with a speed three_times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid 1960 's . 
15516	br-h21	18	54	333481	The substantial progress being made in ballistic_missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles . 
15517	br-h21	18	55	333501	Considering the high cost of the F-108 system - over $ 4 billion for the force that had been planned - and the time_period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project . 
15518	br-h21	18	56	333543	Meanwhile , other air_defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message . 
15519	br-h21	19	57	333560	The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans . 
15520	br-h21	19	58	333575	Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic_missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental_ballistic_missile . 
15521	br-h21	20	59	333616	The impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high energy fuel program . 
15522	br-h21	20	60	333634	This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers . 
15523	br-h21	20	61	333669	Continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the high energy fuel program . 
15524	br-h21	20	62	333706	As a result , the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed . 
15525	br-h21	21	63	333720	These examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations of new major development programs and even more penetrating and far ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology . 
15526	br-h21	21	64	333750	The cost of developing a major weapon_system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it . 
15527	br-h21	22	65	333804	- The deterrent power of our Armed_Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war . 
15528	br-h21	22	66	333832	The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , carrier based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles . 
15529	br-h21	22	67	333855	The second capability is represented by our deployed ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement . 
15530	br-h21	23	68	333886	The Strategic_Air_Command is the principal element of our long_range nuclear capability . 
15531	br-h21	23	69	333898	One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70 , a long range supersonic bomber . 
15532	br-h21	23	70	333926	This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic_missile systems , all_of which are scheduled to become available earlier . 
15533	br-h21	23	71	333962	The first Atlas ICBM 's are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar_year , and the first Titan ICBM 's next year . 
15534	br-h21	23	72	333993	The Minuteman solid fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid 1963 . 
15535	br-h21	23	73	334007	By 1965 , several or all_of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established . 
15536	br-h21	24	74	334025	Thus , the need for the B-70 as a strategic weapon_system is doubtful . 
15537	br-h21	24	75	334039	However , I am recommending that development work on the B-70 air-frame and engines be continued . 
15538	br-h21	24	76	334056	It is expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing . 
15539	br-h21	24	77	334072	By that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon_system . 
15540	br-h21	25	78	334094	I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 ( the B-52_H with the new turbofan_engine ) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case . 
15541	br-h21	25	79	334133	These additional modern bombers will replace some of the older B-47 medium bombers ; one B-52 can do the work of several B-47 's which it will replace . 
15542	br-h21	25	80	334162	Funds are also included in this budget to continue the equipping of the B-52 wings with the Hound_Dog air-to-surface_missile . 
15543	br-h21	26	81	334182	In the coming fiscal_year additional quantities of Atlas , Titan , and Polaris missiles also will be procured . 
15544	br-h24	1	1	334201	If you elect to use the Standard Deduction or the Tax Table , and later find you should have itemized your deductions , you may do so by filing an amended_return within the time prescribed for filing a claim for refund . 
15545	br-h24	1	2	334243	See You_May_Claim_a_Refund , Page 135 . 
15546	br-h24	1	3	334249	The same is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should have used the Standard Deduction or Tax Table . 
15547	br-h24	1	4	334273	The words amended_return should be plainly written across the top of such return . 
15548	br-h24	2	5	334287	April 15 is usually the final date for filing income_tax_returns for most people because they use the calendar_year ending on December 31 . 
15549	br-h24	2	6	334310	If you use a fiscal_year , a year ending on the last day of any month other_than December , your return is_due on or before the 15_th day of the 4_th month after the close of your tax year . 
15550	br-h24	3	7	334350	If the last day ( due_date ) for performing any act for tax purposes , such_as filing a return or making a tax payment , etc. , falls on Saturday , Sunday , or a legal_holiday , you may perform that act on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday , Sunday , or legal_holiday . 
15551	br-h24	3	8	334408	Since April 15 , 1962 , is on Sunday your return for the calendar_year 1961 will be timely filed if it is filed on or before Monday , April 16 , 1962 . 
15552	br-h24	4	9	334441	If you mail a return or tax payment , you must place it in the mails in ample time to reach the district director on or before the due_date . 
15553	br-h24	5	10	334471	If you were required to file a declaration_of_estimated_tax for the calendar_year 1961 , it is not necessary to pay the fourth installment otherwise due on January 15 , 1962 , if you file your income_tax_return Form_1040 , and pay your tax in_full for the calendar_year 1961 by January 31 , 1962 . 
15554	br-h24	5	11	334523	The filing of an original or amended declaration , otherwise due on January 15 , 1962 , is also waived , if you file your Form_1040 for 1961 and pay the full tax by January 31 , 1962 . 
15555	br-h24	5	12	334562	Farmers , for these purposes , have until February 15 , 1962 , to file Form_1040 and pay the tax in_full for the calendar_year 1961 . 
15556	br-h24	5	13	334588	Fiscal_year taxpayers have until the last day of the first month following the close of the fiscal_year ( farmers until the 15_th day of the 2_d month ) . 
15557	br-h24	5	14	334617	See Chapter 38 . 
15558	br-h24	6	15	334621	Nonresident aliens living in Canada or Mexico who earn wages in the United_States may be subject to withholding of tax on their wages , the same as if they were citizens of the United_States . 
15559	br-h24	6	16	334656	Their United_States tax_returns are_due April 16 , 1962 . 
15560	br-h24	6	17	334665	However , if their United_States income is not subject to the withholding of tax on wages , their returns are_due June 15 , 1962 , if they use a calendar_year , or the 15_th day of the 6_th month after the close of their fiscal_year . 
15561	br-h24	7	18	334711	If you are a nonresident alien and a resident of Puerto_Rico , your return is also due June 15 , 1962 , or the 15_th day of the 6_th month after the close of your fiscal_year .

15565	br-h24	9	22	334832	The return for a decedent may also serve as a claim for refund of an overpayment of tax . 
15566	br-h24	9	23	334851	In such a case , Form_1310 should be completed and attached to the return . 
15567	br-h24	9	24	334866	This form may be obtained from the local office of your district director .

15645	br-j29	1	1	336410	It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching_method . 
15646	br-j29	1	2	336438	The structured schools were in an industrial city , with three family tenement_houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes . 
15647	br-j29	1	3	336467	The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle - to upper-middle_class , but fringed by an industrial area . 
15648	br-j29	1	4	336490	In_order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods . 
15649	br-j29	1	5	336515	School_principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas . 
15650	br-j29	1	6	336538	An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data . 
15651	br-j29	1	7	336551	Equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle_class neighborhoods . 
15652	br-j29	2	8	336566	Individual differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement . 
15653	br-j29	2	9	336600	Therefore , third grade children were chosen as subjects for this study . 
15654	br-j29	3	10	336613	For purposes of sample selection only ( individual tests were given later ) we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third grade population in each school_system . 
15655	br-j29	3	11	336649	The subjects for this study were randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution , one-third as underachievers , one-third medium , and one-third over-achievers . 
15656	br-j29	3	12	336675	Children whose reading scores were at_least one standard_deviation below the regression_line of each total third grade school population were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection . 
15657	br-j29	3	13	336703	Over-achievers were at_least one standard_deviation above the regression_line in their school_system . 
15658	br-j29	3	14	336715	The final sample was not significantly different from a normal_distribution in regard_to reading achievement or intelligence_test scores . 
15659	br-j29	3	15	336733	Twenty-four classrooms in twelve unstructured schools furnished 156 cases , 87 boys and 69 girls . 
15660	br-j29	3	16	336749	Eight classrooms in three structured schools furnished 72 cases , 36 boys and 36 girls . 
15661	br-j29	3	17	336765	Administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools . 
15662	br-j29	4	18	336777	It was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with_respect_to the personality variables under investigation . 
15663	br-j29	5	19	336794	An interview schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepared , and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home . 
15664	br-j29	5	20	336822	The parent was asked to describe the child 's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self and others , irrational conformity to rules , orderliness , punctuality , and need for certainty . 
15665	br-j29	5	21	336869	The interviewers were instructed not to suggest answers and , as_much_as_possible , to record the parents ' actual words as they described the child 's behavior in home situations . 
15666	br-j29	6	22	336899	The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records , categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity , then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records . 
15667	br-j29	6	23	336933	Final ratings were made on the basis of a point_system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that was deviant from the discovered norms . 
15668	br-j29	6	24	336971	Children scoring high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations , or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals . 
15669	br-j29	6	25	337010	The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters . 
15670	br-j29	6	26	337024	For_instance , the following statement was rated low in compulsivity , `` She 's naturally quite neat about things , but it does n't bother her at_all if her room gets messy . 
15671	br-j29	6	27	337057	But she cleans it up very well when I remind her '' . 
15672	br-j29	7	28	337070	Castaneda , et_al. revised the Taylor_Anxiety_Scale for use with children . 
15673	br-j29	7	29	337081	The Taylor_Scale was adapted from the Minnesota_Multiphastic_Personality_Inventory , with item selection based upon clinical definitions of anxiety . 
15674	br-j29	7	30	337099	There is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees . 
15675	br-j29	7	31	337124	Reliability and validation work with the Children 's Anxiety_Scale by Castaneda , et_al. demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale . 
15676	br-j29	7	32	337149	Although the Taylor_Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items . 
15677	br-j29	8	33	337183	The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . 
15678	br-j29	8	34	337203	The two ratings yield a correlation of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics . 
15679	br-j29	8	35	337230	In_theory , compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . 
15680	br-j29	8	36	337271	The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken_up later . 
15681	br-j29	9	37	337284	In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children 's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years . 
15682	br-j29	9	38	337328	In establishing criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself . 
15683	br-j29	9	39	337348	The predicted interaction effect should , if potent , extend its influence over all academic achievement . 
15684	br-j29	10	40	337365	The Stanford_Achievement_Test , Form_J , was administered by classroom teachers , consisting_of a battery of six sub_tests : Paragraph Meaning , Word Meaning , Spelling , Language , Arithmetic Computation , and Arithmetic Reasoning . 
15685	br-j29	10	41	337400	All_of these sub-tests involve reading except Arithmetic Computation . 
15686	br-j29	10	42	337409	Scores are stated in grade equivalents on a national norm . 
15687	br-j29	10	43	337420	The battery median grade equivalent was used in data analysis in this study . 
15688	br-j29	11	44	337434	The Wechsler_Intelligence_Scale_for_Children was administered to each sample third grade child by a clinical worker . 
15689	br-j29	11	45	337449	The relationship of intelligence_test scores to school achievement is a well established fact ( in this case , * * f ) ; therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor . 
15690	br-j29	12	46	337490	The criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of over - or under-achievement . 
15691	br-j29	12	47	337507	It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the I._Q. . 
15692	br-j29	12	48	337529	For_example , on the basis of the regression_equation , a child with an I._Q. of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 4.8 ( grade equivalent ) . 
15693	br-j29	12	49	337564	If a child with an I._Q. of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement , his discrepancy score would be + .7 , representing .7 of one year of over-achievement . 
15694	br-j29	12	50	337593	A child with an I._Q. of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 3.5 . 
15695	br-j29	12	51	337612	If such a child scored 3.0 , his discrepancy score would be - .5 , representing .5 of one year of under-achievement . 
15696	br-j29	12	52	337635	In this manner , the factors measured by the intelligence_test were controlled , allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables . 
15697	br-j29	13	53	337662	Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable . 
15698	br-j29	13	54	337685	Figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of each sub-group graphically . 
15699	br-j29	13	55	337697	First_of_all , as we had surmised , the highly compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly better ( * * f ) on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools . 
15700	br-j29	13	56	337731	It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools , the high compulsive children do better ( * * f ) . 
15701	br-j29	13	57	337760	No significant difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school . 
15702	br-j29	13	58	337778	The hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching_method was supported , in this case , at the .05 level . 
15703	br-j29	14	59	337801	While we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured , we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the whole-word_method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives . 
15704	br-j29	14	60	337856	Indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant . 
15705	br-j29	14	61	337874	We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in_spite_of the lack of direction from the environment . 
15706	br-j29	15	62	337929	It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower ) . 
15707	br-j29	15	63	337953	Possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure . 
15708	br-j29	16	64	337969	Our conjecture is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work . 
15709	br-j29	16	65	338004	When helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success . 
15710	br-j29	17	66	338030	The statistical analyses of achievement in_relation_to anxiety and teaching_methods and the interactions of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4 . 
15711	br-j29	17	67	338053	Figure 2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group . 
15712	br-j29	17	68	338067	As predicted , the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly ( * * f ) than those in the structured schools . 
15713	br-j29	17	69	338093	The interaction effect , which is significant at the .01 level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores . 
15714	br-j29	17	70	338116	While high anxiety children achieve significantly less well ( * * f ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children , they appear to do at_least as well as the average in the structured classroom . 
15715	br-j29	18	71	338154	The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools . 
15716	br-j29	18	72	338178	According_to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . 
15717	br-j29	18	73	338209	The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit . 
15718	br-j29	18	74	338240	The child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem . 
15719	br-j29	18	75	338284	Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced . 
15720	br-j29	19	76	338322	The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination . 
15721	br-j29	19	77	338347	But the symbols he is asked to learn are simple . 
15722	br-j29	19	78	338358	As shown earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements . 
15723	br-j29	19	79	338376	Success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved . 
15724	br-j29	19	80	338390	By the time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading , he is completely familiar and at_ease with all_of the elements of words . 
15725	br-j29	19	81	338416	Apparently academic challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so_that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or panicked . 
15726	br-j29	20	82	338452	Sarason et_al. present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test like situation , and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher . 
15727	br-j29	20	83	338486	Although the present study was not a direct replication of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion . 
15728	br-j29	20	84	338507	Observers , in the two school_systems studied here , judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting . 
15729	br-j29	20	85	338546	Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting . 
15730	br-j30	1	1	338574	Analysis means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements . 
15731	br-j30	1	2	338596	Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak_points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak_parts and strengthen good_parts . 
15732	br-j30	2	3	338624	Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in_terms_of individuals . 
15733	br-j30	2	4	338637	Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals . 
15734	br-j30	2	5	338655	For_example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying . 
15735	br-j30	3	6	338668	Let us now put some flesh_on_the_theoretical_bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis . 
15736	br-j30	3	7	338688	One should keep in mind that many_of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas . 
15737	br-j30	4	8	338723	The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business . 
15738	br-j30	4	9	338744	Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive - and the rate_of_attrition due_to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high . 
15739	br-j30	4	10	338775	It was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired - and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed . 
15740	br-j30	5	11	338803	Roleplaying was offered as a solution - and the procedure worked as_follows : all candidates were invited to a hotel conference_room , where the president explained the difficulty he had , and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work_out . 
15741	br-j30	5	12	338850	In_place_of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires , checking their references , interviewing them , asking them to be tried_out , he told them he would prefer to test them . 
15742	br-j30	5	13	338880	Each person was to enter the testing_room , carrying a suitcase of samples . 
15743	br-j30	5	14	338894	Each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product . 
15744	br-j30	5	15	338908	In the testing_room he was to make , successively , three presentations to three different people . 
15745	br-j30	6	16	338925	In the testing_room , three of the veteran salesmen served as antagonists . 
15746	br-j30	6	17	338938	One handled the salesman in a friendly manner , another in a rough manner , and the third in a hesitating manner . 
15747	br-j30	6	18	338961	Each was told to purchase material if he felt_like it . 
15748	br-j30	6	19	338972	The antagonists came_in , one_at_a_time , and did not see or hear the other presentations . 
15749	br-j30	6	20	338988	After each presentation , the antagonist wrote his judgment of the salesmen ; and so did the observers consisting_of the president , three of his salesmen and a psychologist . 
15750	br-j30	7	21	339018	Ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon . 
15751	br-j30	7	22	339032	This procedure was repeated one day a month for four months . 
15752	br-j30	7	23	339044	The batting_average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three . 
15753	br-j30	7	24	339059	The president of the firm , calculating expenses alone , felt his costs had dropped one-half while success in selection had improved over one_hundred per_cent . 
15754	br-j30	8	25	339085	The reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers . 
15755	br-j30	8	26	339133	They were , in_a_sense , `` tried_out '' in realistic situations . 
15756	br-j30	9	27	339145	From the point_of_view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated - and they got a meal out of it as_well_as some insights into their performances . 
15757	br-j30	10	28	339175	Another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real_life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work . 
15758	br-j30	11	29	339204	The position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions . 
15759	br-j30	11	30	339246	All applicants were generally familiar_with the work of the receptionist . 
15760	br-j30	11	31	339257	At the end of work one day , the personnel man took the applicants one_at_a_time , asked them to sit behind the receptionist 's desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes . 
15761	br-j30	11	32	339311	Each girl was independently `` tested '' by the personnel man , and he served not_only as the director , but as the antagonist and the observer . 
15762	br-j30	12	33	339339	Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl , whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time , did the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist , showing wit , sparkle , and aplomb . 
15763	br-j30	12	34	339396	She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day . 
15764	br-j30	13	35	339416	In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no_longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning . 
15765	br-j30	13	36	339454	Some cases in_evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure . 
15766	br-j30	14	37	339470	An engineer had been made the works manager of a firm , supplanting a retired employee who had been considered outstandingly successful . 
15767	br-j30	14	38	339493	The engineer had more_than seven years of experience in the firm , was well trained , was considered a hard_worker , was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded_as a `` comer '' . 
15768	br-j30	14	39	339532	However , he turned_out to be a complete failure in his new position . 
15769	br-j30	14	40	339546	He seemed to antagonize everyone . 
15770	br-j30	14	41	339552	Turnover rates of personnel went_up , production dropped , and morale was visibly reduced . 
15771	br-j30	14	42	339567	Despite the fact that he was regarded_as an outstanding engineer , he seemed to be a very poor administrator , although no one quite knew what was wrong with him . 
15772	br-j30	14	43	339598	At the insistence of his own supervisor - the president of the firm , he enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders . 
15773	br-j30	15	44	339622	He played a number of typical situations before observers , other supervisors who kept notes and then explained to him in_detail what he did they thought was wrong . 
15774	br-j30	15	45	339651	Entirely concerned with efficiency , he was merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes , condemning them to too great an extent . 
15775	br-j30	15	46	339674	He did not really listen to others , had little interest in their ideas , and wanted to have his own way - which was the only right way . 
15776	br-j30	15	47	339704	The entire group of managers explained , in great detail , a number of human relations errors that he made . 
15777	br-j30	16	48	339725	One_by_one , these errors were discussed and one_by_one he rejected accepting them as errors . 
15778	br-j30	16	49	339740	He admitted his behavior , and defended it . 
15779	br-j30	16	50	339749	He refused to change his approach , and instead he attacked high_and_low - the officials for their not backing him , and subordinates for their laxness , stupidity , and stubbornness . 
15780	br-j30	16	51	339781	After the diagnosing , he left the course , convinced that it could do him no good . 
15781	br-j30	17	52	339799	We may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment . 
15782	br-j30	17	53	339813	The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life - and refused to change it . 
15783	br-j30	17	54	339831	We may say that his attitude was foolish , since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills ; or we may say that his attitude was commendable , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others . 
15784	br-j30	17	55	339882	In_any_case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made_over . 
15785	br-j30	18	56	339901	Another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis . 
15786	br-j30	18	57	339927	In a course for supermarket operators , a district_manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager , found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time . 
15787	br-j30	18	58	339966	On playing some typical situations before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated as unsatisfactory . 
15788	br-j30	18	59	339985	He was told he displayed , for_example , a sense of superiority - and he answered : `` Well , I am supposed to know all the answers , are n't I '' ? 
15789	br-j30	18	60	340019	He was criticized for his curtness and abruptness - and he answered : `` I am not working to become popular '' . 
15790	br-j30	18	61	340042	On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior - he answered : `` I have to make decisions . 
15791	br-j30	18	62	340060	That 's my job '' . 
15792	br-j30	18	63	340066	In_short , as frequently happens in analyses , the individual feels threatened and defends himself . 
15793	br-j30	18	64	340082	However , in this case the district_manager was led to see the errors of his ways . 
15794	br-j30	18	65	340099	The necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms . 
15795	br-j30	18	66	340115	How this was accomplished may be described , since this sometimes is a crucial problem . 
15796	br-j30	19	67	340131	The director helped tailor-make a check_list of the district_manager 's errors by asking various observers to write_out sentences commenting on the mistakes they felt he made . 
15797	br-j30	19	68	340158	These errors were then collected and written on a blackboard , condensing similar ideas . 
15798	br-j30	19	69	340173	Eighteen errors were located , and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors . 
15799	br-j30	19	70	340201	They were asked to vote `` true '' if they thought they had seen him make the error , `` false '' if they thought he had not ; and `` cannot say '' if they were not certain . 
15800	br-j30	20	71	340241	The manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went_up , and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard . 
15801	br-j30	20	72	340268	No comments were made during the voting . 
15802	br-j30	20	73	340276	The results looked as_follows : 
15803	br-j30	20	74	340281	* * f . 
15804	br-j30	21	75	340285	The first eight of these eighteen statements , which received at_least one-half of the votes , were duplicated to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager , and when this particular manager roleplayed in other situations , the members checked any items that appeared . 
15805	br-j30	21	76	340331	To prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself only during the sessions , they were rather lengthy ( about twenty minutes ) , the situations were imperfectly described to the manager so that he would not know what to expect , new antagonists were brought on the scene unexpectedly , and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously criticized . 
15806	br-j30	22	77	340413	After every session , the check_marks were totaled up and graphed , and in this way the supervisor 's progress was charted . 
15807	br-j30	23	78	340436	In life we learn to play our roles and we `` freeze '' into patterns which become so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do . 
15808	br-j30	23	79	340466	We can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves , and others can see us better than we see ourselves . 
15809	br-j30	23	80	340489	To learn what we do is the first_step for improvement . 
15810	br-j30	23	81	340500	To accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step . 
15811	br-j30	23	82	340514	To want to change is the third step . 
15812	br-j30	23	83	340523	To practice new procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the fourth step . 
15813	br-j30	23	84	340539	To use these new ways in daily life is the last step . 
15814	br-j30	23	85	340552	Roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training . 
15815	br-j30	24	86	340564	When an evaluative situation is set_up , and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate , we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation . 
15816	br-j30	24	87	340594	Observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion . 
15817	br-j30	24	88	340613	This behavior is more `` veridical '' - or true than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning . 
15818	br-j30	25	89	340645	While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure . 
15819	br-j30	26	90	340670	The objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts . 
15820	br-j30	26	91	340688	In_addition , the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed . 
15821	br-j30	26	92	340701	The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area . 
15822	br-j30	26	93	340726	The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold : 
15823	br-j30	27	94	340743	Spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new . 
15824	br-j31	1	1	340752	It is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient 's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding_sway . 
15825	br-j31	1	2	340777	One learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone - to his voice 's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrotlike . 
15826	br-j31	1	3	340818	The content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph_needle were stuck in one groove ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over_and_over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him . 
15827	br-j31	2	4	340884	One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her . 
15828	br-j31	2	5	340924	Eventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior - which , as_usual , went_on without any accompanying words from her - she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ? 
15829	br-j31	2	6	340977	At_first I did not know what she meant ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home city . 
15830	br-j31	2	7	341011	Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch . 
15831	br-j31	3	8	341043	At another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother introject began to emerge more_and_more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me '' ! 
15832	br-j31	3	9	341085	I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; but a_few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' ! 
15833	br-j31	3	10	341130	Again , I at_first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication , and I quickly cast through my mind to account_for her being able to speak , with such utter conviction , of an opinion held by my father , now several years deceased . 
15834	br-j31	3	11	341173	Then I replied , coldly , `` If you despise me , why do n't you say so , directly '' ? 
15835	br-j31	3	12	341195	She looked confused at this , and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make . 
15836	br-j31	3	13	341216	It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ? 
15837	br-j31	3	14	341234	She clearly agreed that this had been the case . 
15838	br-j31	3	15	341244	I realized , now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way , something her mother had once said to her ; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her . 
15839	br-j31	3	16	341296	What had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now , despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like . 
15840	br-j31	4	17	341337	Earlier , this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at_times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice . 
15841	br-j31	4	18	341389	A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used_to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door - as I would find on passing_by , between our sessions - for_all_the_world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child . 
15842	br-j31	5	19	341438	Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in_which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome . 
15843	br-j31	5	20	341494	I have found , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior . 
15844	br-j31	5	21	341558	For_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got_up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the end of each session . 
15845	br-j31	5	22	341657	Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . 
15846	br-j31	6	23	341757	Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met . 
15847	br-j31	6	24	341805	This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard_to the wishes of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy_chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair - in_short , behaving as if I owned her room . 
15848	br-j31	7	25	341914	Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement . 
15849	br-j31	8	26	341942	One finds , for_example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression , seeming at_first to be a mere hollow convention , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most unconventional of meanings . 
15850	br-j31	8	27	341990	More_than anything , it is the therapist 's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a spread-out deck_of_cards , on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient 's and his months of work together . 
15851	br-j31	8	28	342038	one cannot assume , of_course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later_on when the stereotype was uttered ; probably it is correct to think_of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a_few , other communicational grooves , as_yet - being there , available for the patient 's use , as newly emerging emotions and ideas well_up in him over the course of months . 
15852	br-j31	8	29	342131	But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . 
15853	br-j31	9	30	342177	Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype - a `` How are you now '' ? or an `` I want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning . 
15854	br-j31	9	31	342226	A hebephrenic man used_to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his largely silent hours with his therapist . 
15855	br-j31	9	32	342250	When the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` What is that , Bill - hello or farewell '' ? 
15856	br-j31	9	33	342278	, the patient replied , `` Both , Dearie - two in one '' . 
15857	br-j31	10	34	342293	Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression , that which seems best to give release , and communicational expression , to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter . 
15858	br-j31	10	35	342322	It is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients , shows , as one of his characteristic symptoms , laughter - laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated , which now makes one feel_like weeping , or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man 's despair ; and which , more often than all these , conveys a welter of feelings which could in_no_way be conveyed by any number of words , words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another . 
15859	br-j31	10	36	342427	To a much less full extent , the hebephrenic person 's belching or flatus has a comparable communicative function ; in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at_least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch , or the passage of flatus , not_only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learns that even these animal like sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from_time_to_time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words . 
15860	br-j31	11	37	342542	As I have been intimating , in the schizophrenic - and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic ; this is a question which I have no wish to take_up - condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well sorted_out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another . 
15861	br-j31	11	38	342628	Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard_to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' . 
15862	br-j31	12	39	342681	In my experience , a great many_of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience . 
15863	br-j31	12	40	342715	Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene . 
15864	br-j31	12	41	342747	Recently , for_example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was . 
15865	br-j31	12	42	342813	Or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking . 
15866	br-j31	13	43	342870	Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is , more_often_than_not , entirely unaware . 
15867	br-j31	13	44	342884	His subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one . 
15868	br-j31	13	45	342894	One hebephrenic women confided to me , `` I live in a world of words '' , as if , to her , words were fully concrete objects ; Burnham , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concerning schizophrenic communication , includes mention of similar clinical material . 
15869	br-j31	13	46	342943	A borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding , in a most articulate fashion , during session after session with me , were like great cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him ; as he spoke I was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung , high in the air , from a docked steamship . 
15870	br-j32	1	1	343019	The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary 's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc. . 
15871	br-j32	1	2	343049	A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such_as Russian . 
15872	br-j32	1	3	343071	For English the reduction in size is less striking . 
15873	br-j32	1	4	343081	This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary_entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word . 
15874	br-j32	1	5	343130	The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file . 
15875	br-j32	1	6	343148	Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis . 
15876	br-j32	2	7	343161	We suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem . 
15877	br-j32	2	8	343176	But first , we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood : 
15878	br-j32	3	9	343193	form - any unique sequence of alphabetic_characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space . 
15879	br-j32	4	10	343213	occurrence - an instance of a form in text . 
15880	br-j32	5	11	343223	We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text . 
15881	br-j32	5	12	343252	We accomplish this by compiling a list of text forms as text is read by the computer . 
15882	br-j32	5	13	343270	A random storage scheme , based on the spelling of forms , provides an economical way to compile this text form list . 
15883	br-j32	5	14	343293	Dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked . 
15884	br-j32	5	15	343306	A location in the computer store is also named for each marked form ; dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text . 
15885	br-j32	5	16	343341	Finally , information is retrieved from the dictionary as_required by stages of the translation process - the grammatic description for sentence-structure determination , equivalent choice information for semantic analysis , and target-language equivalents for output construction . 
15886	br-j32	6	17	343378	The dictionary is a form dictionary , at_least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary_entries . 
15887	br-j32	6	18	343404	Also , the dictionary is divided into at_least two parts : 
15888	br-j32	6	19	343415	the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms . 
15889	br-j32	6	20	343431	A more detailed description of dictionary operations - text lookup and dictionary modification - give a clearer picture . 
15890	br-j32	7	21	343450	Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists_of three steps . 
15891	br-j32	7	22	343463	The first is compiling a list of text forms , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence . 
15892	br-j32	7	23	343496	For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W_region are used for storage of the forms in the text form list ; cells in the X-region and Y_region are reserved as information cells for text forms . 
15893	br-j32	8	24	343540	When an occurrence * * f is isolated during text reading , a random_memory address * * f , the address of a cell in the X-region , is computed from the form of * * f . 
15894	br-j32	8	25	343578	Let * * f denote the form of * * f . 
15895	br-j32	8	26	343590	If cell * * f has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text form list , it is now assigned as the information cell of * * f . 
15896	br-j32	8	27	343626	The form itself is stored in the next available cells of the W-region , beginning in cell * * f . 
15897	br-j32	8	28	343647	The address * * f and the number of cells required to store the form are written in * * f ; the information cell * * f is saved to represent the text occurrence . 
15898	br-j32	8	29	343683	Text reading continues with the next occurrence . 
15899	br-j32	9	30	343691	Let us assume that * * f is identical to the form of an occurrence * * f which preceded * * f in the text . 
15900	br-j32	9	31	343718	When this situation exists , the address * * f will equal * * f which was produced from * * f . 
15901	br-j32	9	32	343741	If * * f was assigned as the information cell for * * f , the routine can detect that * * f is identical to * * f by comparing * * f with the form stored at location * * f . 
15902	br-j32	9	33	343785	The address * * f is stored in the cell * * f . 
15903	br-j32	9	34	343799	When , as in_this case , the two forms match , the address * * f is saved to represent the occurrence * * f . 
15904	br-j32	9	35	343825	Text reading continues with the next occurrence . 
15905	br-j32	10	36	343833	A third situation is possible . 
15906	br-j32	10	37	343839	The formula for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form . 
15907	br-j32	10	38	343862	Thus , when more_than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the X-region , a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms , one cell in the chain for each form . 
15908	br-j32	10	39	343900	If * * f leads to an address * * f that is equal to the address computed from * * f , even though * * f does not match * * f , the chain of information cells is extended from * * f by storing the address of the next available cell in the Y-region , * * f , in * * f . 
15909	br-j32	10	40	343968	The cell * * f becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of * * f . 
15910	br-j32	10	41	343993	A third cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in * * f ; similarly , as many cells are added as are required . 
15911	br-j32	10	42	344022	Each information cell in the chain contains the address of the Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned is stored . 
15912	br-j32	10	43	344045	Each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the Y-cell that is the next element of the chain ; the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain . 
15913	br-j32	10	44	344086	Hence , when the address * * f is computed from * * f , the cell * * f and all Y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether * * f is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain . 
15914	br-j32	10	45	344141	When the information cell for * * f has been determined , it is saved as a representation of * * f . 
15915	br-j32	10	46	344164	Text reading continues with the next occurrence . 
15916	br-j32	11	47	344172	Text reading is terminated when a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text form list . 
15917	br-j32	11	48	344191	This initiates the second step of glossary lookup - connecting the information cell of forms in the text form list to dictionary forms . 
15918	br-j32	11	49	344215	Each form represented by the dictionary is looked_up in the text form list . 
15919	br-j32	11	50	344229	Each time a dictionary form matches a text form , the information cell of the matching text form is saved . 
15920	br-j32	11	51	344250	The number of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved . 
15921	br-j32	11	52	344265	These two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage . 
15922	br-j32	11	53	344288	If each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form , the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read . 
15923	br-j32	11	54	344320	The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time . 
15924	br-j32	12	55	344334	Each dictionary form is looked_up in the text form list by the same method used to look_up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading . 
15925	br-j32	12	56	344363	A random address * * f that lies within the X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form . 
15926	br-j32	12	57	344386	If cell * * f is an information cell , it and any information cells in the Y-region that have been linked to * * f each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored . 
15927	br-j32	12	58	344427	The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms . 
15928	br-j32	12	59	344439	When a match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage . 
15929	br-j32	12	60	344456	If cell * * f is not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list . 
15930	br-j32	13	61	344480	These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation . 
15931	br-j32	13	62	344489	The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text form list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text . 
15932	br-j32	13	63	344538	The list of text forms in the W-region of memory and the contents of the information cells in the X and Y-regions are no_longer required . 
15933	br-j32	13	64	344564	Only the assignment of the information cells is important . 
15934	br-j32	14	65	344574	The first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text . 
15935	br-j32	14	66	344590	The grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis . 
15936	br-j32	14	67	344611	A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence . 
15937	br-j32	15	68	344638	The grammatic descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file . 
15938	br-j32	15	69	344658	The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe . 
15939	br-j32	15	70	344671	When entries are being retrieved from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer . 
15940	br-j32	15	71	344699	This selection rejection process takes_place as the file is read . 
15941	br-j32	15	72	344710	Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the W-region . 
15942	br-j32	15	73	344728	The address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form . 
15943	br-j32	15	74	344750	( The address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage . ) 
15944	br-j32	15	75	344768	When the complete file has been read , the grammatic descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the W-region ; the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatic description of the form it represents . 
15945	br-j32	15	76	344815	Hence , the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text ordered information cell addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence . 
15946	br-j32	16	77	344849	The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms . 
15947	br-j32	16	78	344897	This leaves the ordering of entries variable . 
15948	br-j32	16	79	344905	( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it . ) 
15949	br-j32	17	80	344921	Two very useful ways for modifying a form dictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more_than one dictionary form . 
15950	br-j32	17	81	344956	The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage . 
15951	br-j32	17	82	344972	The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents . 
15952	br-j32	17	83	344998	Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at_once . 
15953	br-j32	17	84	345029	An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatic description of each form . 
15954	br-j32	17	85	345044	Equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context . 
15955	br-j32	17	86	345071	Thus , one can think_of a dictionary_entry as a word rather than a form . 
15956	br-j32	18	87	345086	If all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible . 
15957	br-j32	18	88	345111	For_example , the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached . 
15958	br-j32	18	89	345141	( Indeed , the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings . ) 
15959	br-j32	18	90	345161	The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text form list . 
15960	br-j32	18	91	345184	Similarly , if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary , the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form . 
15961	br-j32	18	92	345216	The dictionary system is in_no_way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it . 
15962	br-j32	18	93	345230	When irregularity and variation prevent summarizing , information is written in complete detail . 
15963	br-j32	18	94	345244	Entries are summarized only_when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased . 
15964	br-j33	1	1	345271	In sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here . 
15965	br-j33	1	2	345291	The tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end . 
15966	br-j33	1	3	345302	There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long known hymn tunes . 
15967	br-j33	1	4	345320	Thus the first lines of one of Charles_Wesley 's hymns are as_follows . 
15968	br-j33	1	5	345333	`` A charge to keep I have , A God to glorify '' . 
15969	br-j33	1	6	345347	In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have . 
15970	br-j33	1	7	345382	Dominant stress is of_course more than extended duration , and normally centers_on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center_on its first syllable rather than its last . 
15971	br-j33	1	8	345434	But the parallel is significant . 
15972	br-j33	1	9	345440	When the answer to what 's wrong now ? 
15973	br-j33	1	10	345449	is Bill 's broken a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair . 
15974	br-j33	1	11	345467	From the point_of_view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement is the predicator has broken , and from the point_of_view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the breaking ; but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence . 
15975	br-j33	1	12	345519	In I know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; in one thing I know it will usually be on the predicator know . 
15976	br-j33	1	13	345549	In small-town people are very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly ; in the double sentence the smaller the town , the friendlier the people it will generally be on the subjects the town and the people . 
15977	br-j33	1	14	345592	In what 's a linguist ? 
15978	br-j33	1	15	345598	dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist ; in who 's a linguist ? 
15979	br-j33	1	16	345615	it will generally be on the complement a linguist . 
15980	br-j33	1	17	345625	Dominant stress is on her luggage both in that 's her luggage , where her luggage is the complement , and in there 's her luggage , where it is the subject . 
15981	br-j33	1	18	345658	Adverbial second complements , however , are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences . 
15982	br-j33	1	19	345676	If the answer to what was that noise ? 
15983	br-j33	1	20	345685	is George put the cat out , dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement , the cat , not the second complement out . 
15984	br-j33	1	21	345711	Final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress . 
15985	br-j33	1	22	345721	If the answer to what was that noise ? 
15986	br-j33	1	23	345730	is George reads the news emotionally , dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally . 
15987	br-j33	1	24	345749	When prepositional complements are divided as in what are you looking_for ? 
15988	br-j33	1	25	345761	they are likely to lose dominant stress . 
15989	br-j33	2	26	345769	Context is of extreme importance . 
15990	br-j33	2	27	345775	What is new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not . 
15991	br-j33	2	28	345793	Thus in a context in which there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new , dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows here , but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow , dominant stress will probably be on snows . 
15992	br-j33	2	29	345853	The personal_pronouns and substitute one are normally unstressed because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context . 
15993	br-j33	2	30	345873	In I 'll go_with George dominant stress is probably on George ; but if George has just been mentioned prominently ( and the trip to be made has been under discussion ) , what is said is probably I 'll go_with him , and dominant stress is probably on the preposition with . 
15994	br-j33	2	31	345926	When a gesture accompanies who 's he ? 
15995	br-j33	2	32	345934	the personal_pronoun has dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mentioned previously . 
15996	br-j33	2	33	345949	If both George and a piece of information George does not have are prominent in the context , but the idea of telling George is new , then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell George ? 
15997	br-j33	2	34	345990	But when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious , there is normally only light stress or no stress at_all . 
15998	br-j33	2	35	346015	Thus the unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets its significance from its use with snows : nothing can snow snow but `` it '' . 
15999	br-j33	2	36	346042	In there are n't many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious . 
16000	br-j33	2	37	346078	If women replaced people , it would normally have dominant stress . 
16001	br-j33	2	38	346090	In I have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress than do . 
16002	br-j33	2	39	346112	If work is substituted for things ( with more exact contribution to meaning ) , it will have dominant stress . 
16003	br-j33	2	40	346133	In I know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing . 
16004	br-j33	2	41	346153	In I knew you when you were a child , and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young_woman spoken_to is still pretty . 
16005	br-j33	2	42	346181	Dominant stress on pretty would be almost insulting here . 
16006	br-j33	2	43	346191	In the written_language then can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here , but much of the time the written_language simply depends_on the reader 's alertness , and a careless reader will have to back_up and reread . 
16007	br-j33	3	44	346231	Often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion . 
16008	br-j33	3	45	346243	Thus in it 's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress is likely to be on incredible , and eat will have strong stress also . 
16009	br-j33	3	46	346270	In she has_it_in_for George dominant stress will ordinarily be on in , where the notion of stored_up antipathy seems to center . 
16010	br-j33	3	47	346292	In we 're painting at our garage strong stress on at indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an effort at painting . 
16011	br-j33	3	48	346320	Where there is comparison or contrast dominant stresses normally operate to center attention . 
16012	br-j33	3	49	346334	Thus in his friends are stranger than his sisters ' strong stresses are normal for his and sisters ' , but in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters . 
16013	br-j33	3	50	346372	In he 's hurting himself more_than he 's hurting you both himself and you have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if there were no contrast . 
16014	br-j33	3	51	346400	In is she Chinese or Japanese ? 
16015	br-j33	3	52	346407	the desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns of stress of Chinese and Japanese . 
16016	br-j33	3	53	346438	Sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship . 
16017	br-j33	3	54	346449	Thus in Mary wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on Mary marks Mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip , strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of Mary 's concerned with an account of her trip ( about which she may later have made speeches , for_example ) , and strong stress on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which Mary wrote accounts . 
16018	br-j33	3	55	346539	In hunger stimulates man too the situation is very similar . 
16019	br-j33	3	56	346550	Strong stress on hunger treats hunger as an additional stimulus , strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation as an additional effect of hunger , strong stress on man treats man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger . 
16020	br-j33	3	57	346592	Here again , in the written_language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics , but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context . 
16021	br-j33	4	58	346633	When a word represents a larger construction of which it is the only expressed part , it normally has more stress than it would have in fully expressed construction . 
16022	br-j33	4	59	346663	Thus when yes , I have is the response to have you finished reading the paper ? 
16023	br-j33	4	60	346680	the stress on have , which here represents have finished reading the paper , is quite strong . 
16024	br-j33	4	61	346698	In Mack 's the leader at camp , but Jack is here the is of the second main declarative represents is the leader and therefore has stress . 
16025	br-j33	4	62	346726	Mack 's the leader at camp , but Jack 's here , with this is deprived_of stress , makes here the complement in the clause . 
16026	br-j33	4	63	346752	In of all the suggestions that were made , his was the silliest the possessive his represents his suggestion and is stressed . 
16027	br-j33	4	64	346775	When go represents itself and a complement ( being equivalent , say , to go_to Martinique ) in which boat did Jack go on ? 
16028	br-j33	4	65	346800	it has strong stress ; when it represents only itself and on which is its complement ( so that go on is semantically equivalent_to board ) , on has stronger stress than go does . 
16029	br-j33	4	66	346835	Omission of a subordinator pronoun , however , does not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be object . 
16030	br-j33	4	67	346864	Thus to has light stress both in that was the conclusion that I came to and in that was the conclusion I came to . 
16031	br-j33	4	68	346889	But when to represents to consciousness in that was the moment that I came_to , and similarly in that was the moment I came_to , there is much stronger stress on to . 
16032	br-j33	4	69	346922	In I wanted to tell him , but I was afraid to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him . 
16033	br-j33	4	70	346947	In to tell him , of_course , to is normally unstressed . 
16034	br-j33	4	71	346959	When I have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions that I am to leave this place , dominant stress is ordinarily on leave . 
16035	br-j33	4	72	346988	When the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions which I am to leave , dominant stress is ordinarily on instructions . 
16036	br-j33	5	73	347013	It is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the spoken_language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written . 
16037	br-j33	5	74	347041	Other examples follow . 
16038	br-j33	5	75	347045	`` I 'll come by Tuesday . 
16039	br-j33	5	76	347052	I can n't be happy long without drinking water '' . 
16040	br-j33	5	77	347063	In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent_to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken_language ; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at_most . 
16041	br-j33	5	78	347127	In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking_water is equivalent_to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water . 
16042	br-j33	5	79	347194	But the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for_example , can undermine distinctions such_as these . 
16043	br-j33	5	80	347212	And patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by_any_means . 
16044	br-j33	5	81	347222	In the Steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in I looked_up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second . 
16045	br-j33	6	82	347299	- Syllables are linguistic_units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain circumstances , and which may or may not be combined with preceding and / or following consonants or combinations of consonants . 
16046	br-j33	6	83	347343	Syllables are genuine units , but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties . 
16047	br-j33	6	84	347360	Sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear . 
16048	br-j33	6	85	347370	Doubt on this point is strongest before / l / and / / or / r / . 
16049	br-j33	6	86	347388	From the point_of_view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables . 
16050	br-j33	6	87	347403	Historically re is the formative that is employed also in republic , and al is the common suffix . 
16051	br-j33	6	88	347422	When ity is added , real clearly has two syllables . 
16052	br-j33	6	89	347433	But there is every reason to regard deal as a monosyllable , and because of the fact that / l / commonly has the quality of / / when it follows vowel_sounds , deal seems to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with real . 
16053	br-j34	1	1	347477	It is obvious enough that linguists in_general have been less successful in coping_with tone_systems than with consonants or vowels . 
16054	br-j34	1	2	347497	No single explanation is adequate_to account_for this . 
16055	br-j34	1	3	347505	Improvement , however , is urgent , and at_least three things will be needed . 
16056	br-j34	2	4	347520	The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses . 
16057	br-j34	2	5	347531	Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant_systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details . 
16058	br-j34	2	6	347557	An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal_systems , including some of the more unusual types . 
16059	br-j34	2	7	347578	By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no_more of the range of possibilities in tone_systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour_languages . 
16060	br-j34	2	8	347603	This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone . 
16061	br-j34	2	9	347617	Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist . 
16062	br-j34	2	10	347641	Papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work . 
16063	br-j34	3	11	347660	The second need is better field techniques . 
16064	br-j34	3	12	347668	The great majority of present-day linguists fall_into one or more of a number of overlapping types : those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed , those who are personally scared of tone and tone_languages generally , those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter . 
16065	br-j34	3	13	347748	The result has been neglect , fumbling efforts , or superficial treatment . 
16066	br-j34	3	14	347761	As these maladies overlap , so must the cure . 
16067	br-j34	3	15	347771	Analyses such_as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple . 
16068	br-j34	3	16	347790	They will give suggestions that can be worked_up into field procedures . 
16069	br-j34	3	17	347802	Good field techniques will not_only equip linguists for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitudes . 
16070	br-j34	3	18	347821	Actually , none of these papers says much directly about field techniques . 
16071	br-j34	3	19	347834	But it is worth pondering that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics . 
16072	br-j34	3	20	347854	These things have been disseminated by other means , but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results . 
16073	br-j34	4	21	347875	The third need is for better theory . 
16074	br-j34	4	22	347883	We should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels , but it has not been . 
16075	br-j34	4	23	347908	This can only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are insufficiently general . 
16076	br-j34	4	24	347944	If , as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems . 
16077	br-j34	5	25	347980	One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems . 
16078	br-j34	5	26	347997	Since tone_systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel_systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis . 
16079	br-j34	5	27	348024	Actual practice does not often work_out this way . 
16080	br-j34	5	28	348033	Tone_systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_systems . 
16081	br-j34	6	29	348056	Welmers has suggested one explanation . 
16082	br-j34	6	30	348062	Tone_languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use . 
16083	br-j34	6	31	348077	This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable . 
16084	br-j34	6	32	348094	The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features . 
16085	br-j34	6	33	348110	Of_course , something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology : consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component . 
16086	br-j34	6	34	348136	But in_general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude . 
16087	br-j34	6	35	348154	With tone , individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them . 
16088	br-j34	6	36	348172	Pitch differences from one speaker to another , or from one emotional_state to another , may far exceed the small differences between tones . 
16089	br-j34	6	37	348196	However , any such suggestion accounts_for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone , or in developing a realistic attitude about tone , but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded . 
16090	br-j34	7	38	348235	A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands ' paper . 
16091	br-j34	7	39	348249	Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed . 
16092	br-j34	7	40	348257	Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other . 
16093	br-j34	7	41	348282	Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap in this way ; for_example , duration sometimes figures in both the vowel_system and the intonation . 
16094	br-j34	7	42	348308	Some phonetic features , for_example glottal_catch or murmur , are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual_systems . 
16095	br-j34	7	43	348330	But no other two phonologic_systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some languages . 
16096	br-j34	7	44	348349	This explanation of tone difficulties , however , does not apply in all languages . 
16097	br-j34	7	45	348364	In some ( the Ewe type mentioned above ) interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation spans . 
16098	br-j34	7	46	348387	In many of the syllables , intonation can be safely ignored , and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation . 
16099	br-j34	7	47	348414	Still , even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect . 
16100	br-j34	8	48	348432	A third explanation is suggested by Richardson 's analysis of Sukuma tone . 
16101	br-j34	8	49	348445	There we see a basically simple phonemic_system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic_system . 
16102	br-j34	8	50	348461	While the phonemes can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in_some_way to morphemic units , i._e. until the morphophonemics is worked_out , or at_least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success . 
16103	br-j34	9	51	348510	In the `` typical tone_language '' , tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics . 
16104	br-j34	9	52	348530	The phonemic_systems which must support these morphophonemic_systems , however , are very different . 
16105	br-j34	9	53	348544	The inventory of tones is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension , pitch level . 
16106	br-j34	9	54	348565	Consonantal_systems are not merely larger , they are multidimensional . 
16107	br-j34	9	55	348575	Morphophonemic rules may be thought_of as joining certain points in the system . 
16108	br-j34	9	56	348588	The possibilities in the consonantal_system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used . 
16109	br-j34	9	57	348608	Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity , possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system . 
16110	br-j34	9	58	348635	Tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone . 
16111	br-j34	9	59	348654	The possibilities are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater . 
16112	br-j34	9	60	348670	Often , therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect , and commonly other sets of rules as_well , having the opposite effect . 
16113	br-j34	9	61	348698	Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rules is no greater . 
16114	br-j34	10	62	348723	The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology is an inverse_function of the size - smaller systems are more troublesome - for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity . 
16115	br-j34	10	63	348754	This hypothesis will account_for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis , as well as the fact that vowel_systems are often more puzzling than consonantal_systems . 
16116	br-j34	10	64	348782	The statement of the system is a different matter . 
16117	br-j34	10	65	348792	Smaller systems can of_course be stated much more succinctly . 
16118	br-j34	10	66	348802	A phonemic_system can be stated without reference_to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics . 
16119	br-j34	10	67	348820	And the more complex the morphophonemic_system is in_relation_to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic_system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics - at_least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures . 
16120	br-j34	11	68	348870	The design of orthographies has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves . 
16121	br-j34	11	69	348886	There has been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance . 
16122	br-j34	11	70	348927	This seems naive . 
16123	br-j34	11	71	348931	Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies . 
16124	br-j34	11	72	348957	Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs . 
16125	br-j34	11	73	348983	The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns_out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried_over from European languages . 
16126	br-j34	11	74	349020	Many_of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent . 
16127	br-j34	11	75	349042	Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance . 
16128	br-j34	11	76	349070	As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion . 
16129	br-j34	12	77	349098	A._E._Sharp , in Vowel-Length_and_Syllabicity_in_Kikuyu , examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in_detail . 
16130	br-j34	12	78	349116	His objective is merely to determine `` what distinctions of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography '' ( 59 ) . 
16131	br-j34	12	79	349145	To do so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in_detail . 
16132	br-j34	12	80	349165	In the process , he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult . 
16133	br-j34	12	81	349185	A_few of his examples are of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory . 
16134	br-j34	12	82	349205	His orthographic recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on_the_one_hand or of superficiality on the other . 
16135	br-j34	12	83	349222	Rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness . 
16136	br-j34	12	84	349236	He concludes that some changes can made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes . 
16137	br-j34	12	85	349266	I hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu circles . 
16138	br-j34	12	86	349280	This , however , will not exhaust their practical usefulness , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design . 
16139	br-j34	12	87	349306	We need many_more studies of this sort if the design of written_languages is to be put on a sound basis . 
16140	br-j34	13	88	349327	One other paper deals with a phonologic problem : 
16141	br-j34	13	89	349336	Vowel_Harmony_in_Igbo , by J._Carnochan . 
16142	br-j34	13	90	349341	This restates the already widely known facts in_terms_of prosodies . 
16143	br-j34	13	91	349351	As a restatement it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of Igbo . 
16144	br-j34	13	92	349365	But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of Igbo phonology . 
16145	br-j34	13	93	349390	The paper has a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach , particularly since it treats a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement . 
16146	br-j34	13	94	349433	It does show one feature of the system that has not been previously described . 
16147	br-j34	13	95	349448	But it does not , as it claims , demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods . 
16148	br-j34	13	96	349468	It seems to me that it rather easily can . 
16149	br-j34	14	97	349478	Five of the papers deal with grammatical problems . 
16150	br-j34	14	98	349487	On_the_whole they maintain much the same high standard , but they are much more difficult to discuss in_detail because of their wider variety of subject_matter . 
16151	br-j34	14	99	349513	My comments must be briefer than the papers deserve . 
16152	br-j34	15	100	349523	W._H._Whiteley writes_on The_Verbal_Radical_in_Iraqw . 
16153	br-j34	15	101	349527	This must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early A_short_Description_of_Item-Categories_in_Iraqw . 
16154	br-j34	15	102	349541	It exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms . 
16155	br-j34	15	103	349557	The treatment seems unnecessarily loose_jointed and complex , largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point . 
16156	br-j35	1	1	349588	There are more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto Yokuts . 
16157	br-j35	1	2	349623	This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very_much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; or both . 
16158	br-j35	1	3	349656	The differentiation however is not very_much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 . 
16159	br-j35	1	4	349700	( On deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem / item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages . ) 
16160	br-j35	1	5	349724	These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison . 
16161	br-j35	2	6	349747	The greatest difference in the two sets of figures is_due to differences in the two sets of lists used . 
16162	br-j35	2	7	349767	These differences in_turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built_up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer 's vocabulary is based_on Swadesh 's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined . 
16163	br-j35	2	8	349830	Swadesh in_short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San_Joaquin_Valley . 
16164	br-j35	2	9	349854	The result is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4 . 
16165	br-j35	2	10	349880	Swadesh , and therefore Hoijer , felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ( fox , vulture , salmon , yellow_pine , manzanita ) ; their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root ) . 
16166	br-j35	2	11	349941	The groups are therefore really non comparable in content as_well as in size . 
16167	br-j35	3	12	349955	Other classes are included only by myself ( interrogatives , adverbs ) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer ( pronouns , demonstratives ) . 
16168	br-j35	4	13	349979	What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body_parts and products , which with a proportionally nearly even representation ( 51 terms out of 253 , 25 out of 100 ) come_out with nearly even ratios ; 2.6 and 2.7 ; ( 2 ) Nature ( 29 terms against 17 ) , ratios 3.3 versus 4.1 ; ( 3 ) adjectives ( 16 , 15 terms ) , ratios 3.9 versus 4.7 ; ( 4 ) verbs ( 9 , 22 terms ) , ratios 4.0 versus 3.4 . 
16169	br-j35	5	14	350074	It will be seen that where the scope is similar , the Athabascan ratios come_out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4 : 5 ) except for verbs , where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower . 
16170	br-j35	5	15	350123	This exception may be connected with Hoijer 's use of a much higher percentage of verbs : 
16171	br-j35	5	16	350140	22 % of his total list as against 3.5 % in mine . 
16172	br-j35	5	17	350153	Or the exception may be_due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb . 
16173	br-j35	5	18	350168	More word_class ratios determined in more languages will no_doubt ultimately answer the question . 
16174	br-j35	6	19	350182	If word_classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot , it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans lingually . 
16175	br-j35	6	20	350211	Hoijer 's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several near synonyms like stomach belly , big large , long far , many much , die dead , say speak ) . 
16176	br-j35	6	21	350248	For Yokuts , I tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according_as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more_than 4 stems . 
16177	br-j35	6	22	350278	The totals for these five categories are not too uneven , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively . 
16178	br-j35	6	23	350301	For Athabascan , with a greater range of stems , the first two of five corresponding columns were identical , 1 and 2 stems ; the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively * * f ; * * f ; and * * f stems . 
16179	br-j35	6	24	350353	While the particular limits of these groupings may seem artificially arbitrary ; they do fairly express a corresponding grouping of more variable material , and they eventuate also in five classes , along a similar scale , containing approximately equal numbers of cases , namely 19 , 14 , 15 , 11 , 12 in Athabascan . 
16180	br-j35	8	25	350410	When now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these differences : * * f This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : * * f ; which , divided by * * f gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart . 
16181	br-j35	8	26	350487	If the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families , the distance would of_course be 0 . 
16182	br-j35	8	27	350509	If it were wholly random and unrelated , it would be 2.0 , assuming the five classes were equal in n , which approximately they are . 
16183	br-j35	8	28	350536	The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement . 
16184	br-j35	9	29	350583	In 1960 , David_D._Thomas published Basic Vocabulary in some Mon_Khmer Languages AL 2 , no. 3 , pp. 7 - 11 ) , which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages with the I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate ( * * f ) in_place_of original ( * * f ) , and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in Towards_Greater_Accuracy ( IJAL_21_:_121_-_137 ) . 
16185	br-j35	9	30	350651	Thomas ' findings are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence '' ; but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' ( as between M-K and I-E . 
16186	br-j35	9	31	350696	His first conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath. and Yok . ) was partially positive . 
16187	br-j35	9	32	350722	His second conclusion , on semantic word_classes , agrees with mine . 
16188	br-j35	9	33	350734	This second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored . 
16189	br-j35	10	34	350768	Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence , which weights not_only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative_frequency . 
16190	br-j35	10	35	350800	Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is : stem identical in 8 languages , 100 % ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86 % ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64 % ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57 % . 
16191	br-j35	10	36	350851	His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material . 
16192	br-j35	10	37	350876	But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; and Gleason presumably is on_the_way with a further contribution in this area . 
16193	br-j35	11	38	350915	As to relative_frequencies of competing roots ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc_. ) , Thomas with his ' weighting ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have . 
16194	br-j35	11	39	350953	The problem needs further exploration . 
16195	br-j35	11	40	350959	I was at_least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication , in which , in listing ' Two_Stem_Meanings ' , I set_off by asterisks those forms in which n of stem B was * * f of stem A_3 , the unasterisked ones standing_for * * f ; or under ' Four_Stems ' , I set_off by asterisks cases where the combined n of stems * * f was * * f . 
16196	br-j35	12	41	351037	These findings , and_others which will in_time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry . 
16197	br-j35	12	42	351055	If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per_cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per_cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? 
16198	br-j35	12	43	351109	Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller . 
16199	br-j35	12	44	351142	And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones . 
16200	br-j35	13	45	351175	It is evident that Swadesh has not_only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items . 
16201	br-j35	13	46	351206	Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ? 
16202	br-j35	13	47	351219	It is the urge to obtain a list as free_of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible . 
16203	br-j35	13	48	351236	And why that insistence ? 
16204	br-j35	13	49	351241	It is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence . 
16205	br-j35	13	50	351255	But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a snare . 
16206	br-j35	13	51	351269	Not that such a list cannot be constructed ; but the nearer it comes_to attaining universality , the less significant will it be linguistically . 
16207	br-j35	13	52	351294	Its terms will tend to be labile or vague , and they will fit actual languages more_and_more badly . 
16208	br-j35	14	53	351313	The practical operational problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison . 
16209	br-j35	14	54	351348	The most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as possible . 
16210	br-j35	14	55	351365	In proportion as meanings are concrete , we can better rely_on their being insulated and distinctive . 
16211	br-j35	14	56	351382	An elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , common-sense , indubitable identity , as do an eye or tooth or nail . 
16212	br-j35	14	57	351420	They isolate out easily , naturally , and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence ; and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities . 
16213	br-j35	15	58	351457	With the universal list as his weapon , Swadesh has extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve millennia back . 
16214	br-j35	15	59	351487	And he has proclaimed greater or less affiliation between all Western_hemisphere languages . 
16215	br-j35	15	60	351500	Some of_this may prove to be true , or even considerable of_it , whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence . 
16216	br-j35	15	61	351523	But the farther out he moves , the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence , and the larger the speculative component in his inferences . 
16217	br-j35	15	62	351550	He has traversed provinces and kingdoms , but he has not consolidated them behind him , nor does he control them . 
16218	br-j35	15	63	351572	He has announced results on Hokan , Penutian , Uto-Aztecan , and almost all other American families and phyla , and has diagrammed their degree of interrelation ; but he has not worked_out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other_than Salish . 
16219	br-j35	15	64	351619	That is his privilege . 
16220	br-j35	15	65	351624	The remote , cloudy , possible has values of its own - values of scope , stimulus , potential , and imagination . 
16221	br-j35	15	66	351647	But there is also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics : 
16222	br-j35	15	67	351657	the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as_well as their more remote and elusive external links ; of classification first , with elapsed age merely a by-product ; of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in Athabascan , in Yokuts , in Uto-Aztecan in the last few thousand years as_well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them . 
16223	br-j35	15	68	351725	This involves step-by-step progress , and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry . 
16224	br-j35	15	69	351749	If of the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding , and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should swerve . 
16225	br-j35	16	70	351782	There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh 's rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown so vast . 
16226	br-j35	16	71	351808	It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble , solid , and limited basis . 
16227	br-j35	17	72	351832	I would propose , first , an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved . 
16228	br-j35	18	73	351862	I would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible . 
16229	br-j35	18	74	351892	There would be no conceivable sense in going_to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable . 
16230	br-j35	18	75	351913	An attempted middle course might lead to devices like a 5000 - word alphabetized dictionary from which every fiftieth word was selected . 
16231	br-j38	1	1	351936	Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . 
16232	br-j38	1	2	351969	Some vocational training_schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . 
16233	br-j38	2	3	351984	The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes_Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home_economics . 
16234	br-j38	2	4	352035	Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program . 
16235	br-j38	2	5	352049	The George-Barden_Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $ 29 million in_addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith_Act . 
16236	br-j38	2	6	352074	The Health_Amendment_Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical_nurse training . 
16237	br-j38	3	7	352086	The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National_Defense_Education_Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden_Act . 
16238	br-j38	3	8	352110	Annual authorizations of $ 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians . 
16239	br-j38	4	9	352133	The Federal program of vocational education merely provides financial_aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools . 
16240	br-j38	4	10	352154	The initiative , administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts . 
16241	br-j38	4	11	352168	Even the states remain primarily in an assisting role , providing leadership and teacher training . 
16242	br-j38	5	12	352184	Federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at_least half . 
16243	br-j38	5	13	352206	The state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . 
16244	br-j38	5	14	352239	Throughout the history of the program , state_government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures , while local districts all_together have spent more_than either Federal or state_governments . 
16245	br-j38	5	15	352272	Today , Federal funds account_for only one-fifth of the nation 's expenditures for vocational education . 
16246	br-j38	5	16	352288	The greatest impact of the matching fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . 
16247	br-j38	6	17	352319	National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades . 
16248	br-j38	6	18	352336	During World_War 2 , about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) Vocational Education for National Defense , and ( 2 ) War Production Training . 
16249	br-j38	6	19	352378	The total cost of the five year program was $ 297 million . 
16250	br-j38	6	20	352391	For the Smith-Hughes , George-Barden , and National_Defense_Act of 1958 , the cumulative total of Federal expenditures in 42 years was only about $ 740 million . 
16251	br-j38	7	21	352418	No comparable measures are available of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education training . 
16252	br-j38	7	22	352433	There are a great number and variety of private commercial schools , trade_schools and technical_schools . 
16253	br-j38	7	23	352449	In_addition , many large corporations operate their own formal training_programs . 
16254	br-j38	7	24	352460	A recent study indicated that 85 per_cent of the nation 's largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations . 
16255	br-j38	8	25	352483	Most skilled industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions . 
16256	br-j38	8	26	352500	The National_Manpower_Council of Columbia_University has estimated that three out of five skilled_workers and one out of five technicians have not been formally trained . 
16257	br-j38	9	27	352524	There is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education . 
16258	br-j38	9	28	352536	Employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather_than those without , and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training . 
16259	br-j38	9	29	352564	Vocational educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled_workers , but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills . 
16260	br-j38	10	30	352586	In most states , trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high_schools , usually located in the larger cities . 
16261	br-j38	10	31	352610	In Arkansas fewer than 6 per_cent of the high_schools offer trade and industrial courses . 
16262	br-j38	10	32	352625	In Illinois about 13 per_cent of the schools have programs , and in Pennsylvania 11 per_cent . 
16263	br-j38	11	33	352642	An important recent trend is the development of area vocational_schools . 
16264	br-j38	11	34	352653	For a number of years Kentucky , Louisiana and several other states have been building state sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties . 
16265	br-j38	11	35	352682	These schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts . 
16266	br-j38	11	36	352704	Transportation may be provided from nearby school districts . 
16267	br-j38	11	37	352713	Courses are provided mainly for post high_school day programs ; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high_school students to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted . 
16268	br-j38	12	38	352744	The Title 8 , program of the National_Defense_Education_Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools . 
16269	br-j38	12	39	352765	By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states . 
16270	br-j38	12	40	352777	They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas . 
16271	br-j38	12	41	352799	An extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken . 
16272	br-j38	13	42	352813	Some of this trend toward area vocational_schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry . 
16273	br-j38	14	43	352839	The major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of pre employment training for a large_number of semi-skilled machine operators . 
16274	br-j38	14	44	352864	A_few key skilled_workers experienced in the company 's type of work usually must be brought_in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere . 
16275	br-j38	14	45	352893	A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training_programs in the area to supply future skilled_workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees . 
16276	br-j38	15	46	352922	The existence of a public_school vocational training_program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled . 
16277	br-j38	15	47	352944	Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked_out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being . 
16278	br-j38	15	48	352971	Thus , besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts . 
16279	br-j38	16	49	353004	Few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry . 
16280	br-j38	16	50	353025	The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad_hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment_training_programs that my be quickly set_up in a community to aid a new industrial plant . 
16281	br-j38	17	51	353065	The major weakness of vocational training_programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands . 
16282	br-j38	17	52	353085	This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country . 
16283	br-j38	18	53	353110	Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained_workers . 
16284	br-j38	18	54	353126	All the manuals for setting_up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the growth of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content . 
16285	br-j38	19	55	353169	Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys . 
16286	br-j38	19	56	353186	Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded_as more hypothetical . 
16287	br-j38	20	57	353202	While the U._S. Department_of_Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning . 
16288	br-j38	20	58	353239	The U._S. Office_of_Education continues to stress local surveys rather_than national surveys . 
16289	br-j38	21	59	353251	This procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment . 
16290	br-j38	21	60	353269	Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in_order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training_programs for those skills . 
16291	br-j38	21	61	353301	No effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained . 
16292	br-j38	22	62	353344	Moreover , the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary . 
16293	br-j38	22	63	353364	There simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in_demand and the types of training_programs that are required or most suitable . 
16294	br-j38	22	64	353392	Much of the available information comes not from the Federal_government but from an exchange of experiences among states . 
16295	br-j38	23	65	353411	State and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities . 
16296	br-j38	23	66	353433	There is a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school_boards in existing programs . 
16297	br-j38	24	67	353460	A related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided . 
16298	br-j38	24	68	353476	There is little evidence that existing public or private training_programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payments , and are not guaranteed a job . 
16299	br-j38	24	69	353517	However , there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training . 
16300	br-j38	24	70	353538	Again , one major difficulty is the local focus . 
16301	br-j38	25	71	353548	A training_program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community . 
16302	br-j38	25	72	353589	If there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere , many_more workers can be expected to respond . 
16303	br-j38	26	73	353610	Another problem is who will pay for the training . 
16304	br-j38	26	74	353620	Local school districts are hard_pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training . 
16305	br-j38	26	75	353632	Programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business_leaders demand it . 
16306	br-j38	26	76	353648	Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in_sight and requests it . 
16307	br-j38	26	77	353671	State_governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational_schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities . 
16308	br-j38	26	78	353692	Only the Federal_government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs . 
16309	br-j38	27	79	353719	If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states . 
16310	br-j38	27	80	353756	However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as_well_as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . 
16311	br-j38	27	81	353789	Such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . 
16312	br-j38	28	82	353808	A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G._I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . 
16313	br-j38	28	83	353849	This probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment_compensation or a Youth_Conservation_Corps . 
16314	br-j38	28	84	353878	A maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from home . 
16315	br-j38	29	85	353896	A program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor . 
16316	br-j38	29	86	353915	Instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training . 
16317	br-j38	29	87	353943	Such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located . 
16318	br-j38	29	88	353973	This would heighten possibilities for part-time cooperative , on-the-job and extension training . 
16319	br-j38	30	89	353986	Personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual . 
16320	br-j38	30	90	354003	His aptitudes and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training . 
16321	br-j41	1	1	354018	Wage price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces - no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases . 
16322	br-j41	1	2	354044	The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage price behavior of a_few very important industries . 
16323	br-j41	1	3	354084	While there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United_States since World_War_2 , . 
16324	br-j41	1	4	354129	Indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here presented . 
16325	br-j41	2	5	354154	The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price_competition , but which is so basic that its wage price policies are held in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . 
16326	br-j41	2	6	354189	Where the industry 's product price has been kept below the `` profit_maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' prices due_to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands . 
16327	br-j41	2	7	354231	The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications . 
16328	br-j41	3	8	354252	In_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . 
16329	br-j41	3	9	354306	For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells_out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages . 
16330	br-j41	4	10	354349	Part 1 , below describes this abstract model by spelling_out its assumptions . 
16331	br-j41	4	11	354362	Part 2 , discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions . 
16332	br-j41	4	12	354377	Part 3 , discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of the conclusions . 
16333	br-j41	4	13	354391	Part 4 , is a brief summary . 
16334	br-j41	4	14	354399	The Mathematical Appendix presents the rigorous argument , but is best read after Part 1 , in_order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be explicit . 
16335	br-j41	5	15	354426	The industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry , producing a substantial share of gross_national_product . 
16336	br-j41	5	16	354446	Price_competition is lacking . 
16337	br-j41	5	17	354450	For the purposes of setting the product price , the industry behaves as a single entity . 
16338	br-j41	5	18	354467	In wage negotiations , the industry bargains as a unit with a single union . 
16339	br-j41	6	19	354482	We are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry 's product . 
16340	br-j41	6	20	354494	The manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given . 
16341	br-j41	6	21	354508	In any given time_period , the aggregate demand for the industry 's product is determined by two things : the price charged by the industry , and the level of GNP . 
16342	br-j41	6	22	354540	For the purposes of this discussion , the problem of relative prices is encompassed in these two variables , since GNP includes other prices . 
16343	br-j41	6	23	354565	( We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change proportionately . ) 
16344	br-j41	7	24	354584	The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of GNP . 
16345	br-j41	8	25	354613	The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest . 
16346	br-j41	8	26	354634	Because of its importance , and because the lack of price_competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases . 
16347	br-j41	8	27	354671	The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases . 
16348	br-j41	8	28	354724	For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average_cost ) . 
16349	br-j41	9	29	354779	For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due_to rising wages , etc . ) . 
16350	br-j41	9	30	354815	Thus , if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate . 
16351	br-j41	9	31	354844	In this model , we abstract from all non wage sources of cost changes , so that the `` public limit price '' only rises as the wage rate rises . 
16352	br-j41	9	32	354875	In such circumstances , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate . 
16353	br-j41	10	33	354899	Since marginal_costs rise when the wage rate rises , the profit_maximizing price also rises when the public limit price is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter . 
16354	br-j41	10	34	354931	The entry limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition , but unless general inflation permits profit_margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price . 
16355	br-j41	10	35	354971	The foreign entry limit price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage rates do not enter foreign costs directly . 
16356	br-j41	10	36	354993	Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure . 
16357	br-j41	11	37	355042	Whether or not it is in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends_upon the extent to which the public limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase . 
16358	br-j41	11	38	355095	The extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase . 
16359	br-j41	12	39	355140	We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry . 
16360	br-j41	12	40	355189	The industry may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in_order to `` educate '' the government and the customers of the industry . 
16361	br-j41	12	41	355220	As a strike continues , these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement . 
16362	br-j41	12	42	355238	They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail . 
16363	br-j41	13	43	355257	Public indignation and resistance to wage price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3 % per_annum than when the increases are on the order of 3 % per month . 
16364	br-j41	13	44	355294	The simple passage of an additional eleven months ' time makes the second 3 % boost more acceptable . 
16365	br-j41	13	45	355313	Thus , the public limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase . 
16366	br-j41	13	46	355338	Notice , however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per_se , without an accompanying wage increase . 
16367	br-j41	13	47	355362	Similarly , higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase . 
16368	br-j41	13	48	355404	This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however - only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage price increases . 
16369	br-j41	13	49	355431	Finally , since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call_for less_than proportionately larger price increases ( e._g. , if a wage increase of 5 % allows a price increase of 7 % , a wage increase of 10 % allows a price increase of something less_than 14 % ) . 
16370	br-j41	14	50	355490	We assume that average total unit_cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with_respect_to quantity produced ( the average_cost curve is horizontal , and therefore is identical with the marginal_cost curve ) , and is the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry ) . 
16371	br-j41	14	51	355539	The level of this average_cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and_so_forth . 
16372	br-j41	14	52	355554	As we have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate . 
16373	br-j41	14	53	355580	The level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate . 
16374	br-j41	15	54	355599	The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership , and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate . 
16375	br-j41	15	55	355633	The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy - its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment . 
16376	br-j41	16	56	355672	The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases , but we abstract from these forces here . 
16377	br-j41	16	57	355698	For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs . 
16378	br-j41	16	58	355740	Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time_period is not even well_known to the industry , much_less to the union or to the public . 
16379	br-j41	16	59	355774	Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit_margins related to a productivity increase should be shared . 
16380	br-j41	16	60	355800	The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity share increases as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate . 
16381	br-j41	17	61	355846	We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price level increases may offset wage rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate . 
16382	br-j41	17	62	355890	For internal political reasons , the union asks for ( and accepts ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up_to the discretion of the companies of the industry . 
16383	br-j41	18	63	355941	Changes in the basic wage rate are cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices . 
16384	br-j41	18	64	355960	However , it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude . 
16385	br-j41	19	65	356005	In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled_out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise . 
16386	br-j41	19	66	356068	Thus , for non negative changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active wage_setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence . 
16387	br-j41	19	67	356104	The presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously . 
16388	br-j41	19	68	356146	From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be_due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model . 
16389	br-j41	19	69	356181	It is this conclusion that we challenge ; we do so by disproving the presumption on which it is based . 
16390	br-j41	20	70	356202	It is convenient to assume that the union industry contract is of one year 's duration . 
16391	br-j42	1	1	356219	In the century from 1815 to 1914 the law_of_nations became international_law . 
16392	br-j42	1	2	356231	Several factors contributed to this change . 
16393	br-j42	2	3	356238	The Congress_of_Vienna is a convenient starting_point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow . 
16394	br-j42	2	4	356255	Here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world . 
16395	br-j42	2	5	356274	Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political_system that was central to world politics for a century . 
16396	br-j42	2	6	356294	International_law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European_nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . 
16397	br-j42	2	7	356331	Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international_law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political_system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; second , it had to be compatible with the value_system that they shared . 
16398	br-j42	2	8	356385	In both respects , international_law was Europeanized . 
16399	br-j42	3	9	356393	It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions . 
16400	br-j42	3	10	356410	On_the_one_hand , the major European_nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience . 
16401	br-j42	3	11	356466	But there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard_to most_of the rest of the world . 
16402	br-j42	3	12	356486	Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere . 
16403	br-j42	3	13	356514	Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin_America ( though limited in Latin_America by the special interest of the United_States as expressed in the Monroe_Doctrine , itself from the outset related_to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance_of_power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in_order to preserve both common economic_values and the European `` balance '' itself . 
16404	br-j42	3	14	356577	A nation such_as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin_American countries ; out_of_the_question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa . 
16405	br-j42	4	15	356626	This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19_th century scholars . 
16406	br-j42	4	16	356642	More emphasis was put upon the fact that international_law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; Kent and Story , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made_use_of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent . 
16407	br-j42	4	17	356688	Wheaton stated that the public_law was essentially `` limited to the civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin '' . 
16408	br-j42	4	18	356713	Of_course it had always been of European origin in_fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural_law theory . 
16409	br-j42	4	19	356735	Now , with virtually every writer , not_only was the European origin of public_law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others . 
16410	br-j42	4	20	356773	The European customs on which international_law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states . 
16411	br-j42	4	21	356810	Hall , for_example , was quite explicit on this point when he said `` states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law governed countries . 
16412	br-j42	4	22	356839	They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . 
16413	br-j42	4	23	356873	During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin_American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today . 
16414	br-j42	5	24	356909	A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states . 
16415	br-j42	5	25	356946	The difference is important , for although the older law_of_nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by_no_means its exclusive domain . 
16416	br-j42	5	26	356969	The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . 
16417	br-j42	5	27	356996	The theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality . 
16418	br-j42	5	28	357024	It lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . 
16419	br-j42	5	29	357060	No_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action . 
16420	br-j42	6	30	357089	To appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy . 
16421	br-j42	6	31	357106	First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity . 
16422	br-j42	6	32	357141	National identification was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred . 
16423	br-j42	6	33	357162	It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put_forward by the Germans , especially by Hegel , although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes . 
16424	br-j42	6	34	357198	National identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction and saw law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection . 
16425	br-j42	6	35	357225	In the international community this reduced law to Jellinek 's auto_limitation . 
16426	br-j42	6	36	357237	A state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent . 
16427	br-j42	6	37	357266	According_to the new theories , the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessors . 
16428	br-j42	6	38	357292	He no_longer sought to find the law ; he made it ; he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be . 
16429	br-j42	6	39	357317	There was no law , domestic or international , except that willed by , acknowledged by , or consented to by states . 
16430	br-j42	7	40	357340	Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence . 
16431	br-j42	7	41	357353	Related_to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another . 
16432	br-j42	7	42	357371	Increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions . 
16433	br-j42	7	43	357392	The efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industrialization , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions . 
16434	br-j42	7	44	357442	Law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking_to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms . 
16435	br-j42	7	45	357466	Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no_longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed . 
16436	br-j42	7	46	357496	The old way of doing things , which depended_on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no_longer adequate_to the task . 
16437	br-j42	7	47	357523	First was the period of codification of existing law : the Code_Napoleon in France and the peculiar codification that , in_fact , resulted from Austin 's restatement and ordering of the Common_Law in England . 
16438	br-j42	7	48	357558	Codification was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation , some changing and adjusting the older law , much dealing with entirely new situations . 
16439	br-j42	7	49	357586	The legislative mills have been grinding ever since , and when its cumbersome processes were no_longer adequate_to the task , a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another , to the executive . 
16440	br-j42	7	50	357622	Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law . 
16441	br-j42	7	51	357651	Indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific . 
16442	br-j42	8	52	357673	In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament - the elected representatives - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary . 
16443	br-j42	8	53	357711	When the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit - when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purposes were served : Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law became a rational system for implementing that will , for serving conscious goals , for embodying the `` public policy '' . 
16444	br-j42	8	54	357784	It is true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy . 
16445	br-j42	8	55	357823	Law was seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' . 
16446	br-j42	8	56	357836	However , the sovereign was not Hobbes ' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin . 
16447	br-j42	8	57	357854	It was , too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by_no_means an immoral or amoral one . 
16448	br-j42	8	58	357881	Man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny . 
16449	br-j42	8	59	357898	The theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a Hegelian mystique . 
16450	br-j42	8	60	357914	It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government . 
16451	br-j42	8	61	357928	It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority . 
16452	br-j42	9	62	357952	Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society . 
16453	br-j42	9	63	357967	To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority - administrative_officials and judges - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with . 
16454	br-j42	9	64	358054	Contract - conceived as the free bargain of formal equals - replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status conscious society . 
16455	br-j42	9	65	358078	Indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society . 
16456	br-j42	9	66	358097	Government itself was based upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement . 
16457	br-j42	9	67	358145	It is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in_terms_of contract . 
16458	br-j42	9	68	358161	In_fact , some - Anzilotti is the principle example - went so far as to say that all international_law could be traced to the single legal norm , Pacta sunt Servanda . 
16459	br-j42	10	69	358193	The displacement ( at_least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international_law theory and doctrine . 
16460	br-j42	10	70	358221	In_the_first_place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal_system . 
16461	br-j42	10	71	358248	One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded_as the law_of_nations . 
16462	br-j42	10	72	358261	Admiralty_law , the law_merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law_of_Nations and made dependent_on the several national laws . 
16463	br-j42	10	73	358299	Private international_law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international_law proper , or , as it is often called , public international_law . 
16464	br-j42	10	74	358330	States were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as_to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many claims arising on the high_seas . 
16465	br-j42	10	75	358376	The change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in_fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations . 
16466	br-l08	1	1	358412	`` Well '' - said Mr._Skyros . 
16467	br-l08	1	2	358419	`` I take a little time to think it over '' . 
16468	br-l08	1	3	358431	It was awkward : very awkward . 
16469	br-l08	1	4	358438	There would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take_over . 
16470	br-l08	1	5	358451	Someone reasonably trustworthy . 
16471	br-l08	1	6	358455	And Angie would hear about it . 
16472	br-l08	1	7	358462	And Angie knew - 
16473	br-l08	2	8	358466	`` Time '' , said Angie , and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr._Skyros . 
16474	br-l08	2	9	358483	`` Not too much time , because I 'll be needing some more myself pretty_much right_away . 
16475	br-l08	2	10	358500	And I done favors for you , big favor not so long back , did n't I , and I 'm right here to take_on where Pretty left_off . 
16476	br-l08	2	11	358529	No trouble . 
16477	br-l08	2	12	358532	I do n't want no trouble , you do n't want no trouble , nobody wants trouble , Mr._Skyros '' . 
16478	br-l08	3	13	358553	Dear_heaven , no , thought Mr._Skyros , turning_away as another man came_in . 
16479	br-l08	3	14	358566	He straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand ; the genial smile seemed painted on his face . 
16480	br-l08	3	15	358587	Angie knew - Speak_of dangerous information ! 
16481	br-l08	3	16	358594	Angie knew too_much entirely already . 
16482	br-l08	3	17	358600	Really he had Mr._Skyros at_bay . 
16483	br-l08	4	18	358606	`` Big favor I done you . 
16484	br-l08	4	19	358613	Acourse there 's this deal o ' Denny 's - and Jackie 's - kinda hangin_'_fire , ai n't it , maybe you 've been kinda worryin ' over that . 
16485	br-l08	4	20	358644	And can n't say I blame you '' , said Angie thoughtfully . 
16486	br-l08	4	21	358657	`` This deal with the ace o ' spades . 
16487	br-l08	4	22	358667	Anything to do with an ace o ' spades , bad_luck '' . 
16488	br-l08	5	23	358680	Ace_of_spades - a widow , that was what they called a widow , these low-class crooks remembered Mr._Skyros distractedly . 
16489	br-l08	5	24	358700	All about that Angie knew , too . 
16490	br-l08	5	25	358708	When things got a_little out_of_hand , they very rapidly got a_lot out_of_hand - it seemed to be a general rule . 
16491	br-l08	5	26	358729	All just by_chance , and in_a_way tracing back to poor Frank , all_of it , because naturally - brothers , living together - and Angie - 
16492	br-l08	6	27	358755	Mr._Skyros did not at all like the look on Angelo 's regular featured , almost girlishly good-looking face - or indeed anything about Angelo . 
16493	br-l08	6	28	358780	Mr._Skyros was not a man who thought very_much about moral_principles ; he found money much more interesting ; but all_the_same he thought now , uneasily , of the way in which Angelo earned his living - and paid for his own stuff - and eyed the soft smile , and the spaniel like dark eyes , and he felt a_little ill . 
16494	br-l08	7	29	358842	`` Look , my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the proverb says , better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure . 
16495	br-l08	7	30	358877	I stay in business so long because I 'm careful . 
16496	br-l08	7	31	358888	Two_weeks , a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this_and_that , then we make a little deal , is n't it '' ? 
16497	br-l08	8	32	358924	`` That 's a long while '' , said Angie . 
16498	br-l08	8	33	358935	`` I tell you , you want to leave it that way , I do n't fool_around with it . 
16499	br-l08	8	34	358955	I go over to Castro and get fixed_up there . 
16500	br-l08	8	35	358965	I can n't wait no two_weeks '' . 
16501	br-l08	9	36	358973	And Mr._Skyros did n't like Angie , but what with Prettyman and three of his boys inside , and not likely to come_out - And Angie such a valuable salesman , Prettyman said - All the nuisance and danger of getting_in_touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys - Why did everything have to happen at_once ? 
16502	br-l08	10	37	359031	Denny said stupidly , `` Why , you ai n't turning Angie down , are you , Mr._Skyros ? 
16503	br-l08	10	38	359050	I mean , we all figured - I guess anybody 'd figure - Angie '' - 
16504	br-l08	11	39	359066	Angelo gave him an affectionate smile . 
16505	br-l08	11	40	359073	`` Mr._Skyros too smart a fellow want to get_rid_of me '' , he said . 
16506	br-l08	11	41	359088	`` It 's O._K. , Denny , everything 's O._K. Ai n't it , Mr._Skyros '' ? 
16507	br-l08	12	42	359105	Oh , God , the name repeated over_and_over , anybody to hear - Not being a fool , Mr._Skyros knew why . 
16508	br-l08	12	43	359127	But aside from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held - you could say - the whip_hand . 
16509	br-l08	12	44	359159	And all because of Domokous ! 
16510	br-l08	12	45	359165	If Mr._Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young_man would eventually cause - 
16511	br-l08	13	46	359179	Of_course , there was another factor . 
16512	br-l08	13	47	359186	Angie worth his weight in gold right now , but these users , they sometimes went_down fast . 
16513	br-l08	13	48	359204	Who knew , Angie might not last long . 
16514	br-l08	13	49	359213	The sweat broke_out on Mr._Skyros ' forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking - hoping - planning - perhaps - 
16515	br-l08	14	50	359235	Good_God_above , had not Domokous been enough ? 
16516	br-l08	15	51	359243	He patted Angelo 's thin shoulder paternally . 
16517	br-l08	15	52	359251	`` Now you do n't want to go talking that way '' , he said . 
16518	br-l08	15	53	359267	`` Sure , sure , you 're the one take_over for Pretty , soon as I get the supply , get started up again , is n't it ? 
16519	br-l08	15	54	359296	You do n't need worry , Angelo . 
16520	br-l08	15	55	359304	I tell you , I know how it is with you , my friend , I sympathize , and I 'll make it a special point - a special favor - get_in_touch , and get some stuff just for you . 
16521	br-l08	15	56	359345	I do n't know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow , but I 'll try my best , my friend . 
16522	br-l08	15	57	359368	You see , you got to remember , we all got schedules , like any business ! 
16523	br-l08	15	58	359385	My man , he won n't be around a little while , he just fixed me up with this stuff they took_out of the Elite . 
16524	br-l08	15	59	359411	It 's awkward , you see that , is n't it '' ? 
16525	br-l08	16	60	359424	`` Well , that 's your business , Mr._Skyros '' , said Angie , and his dreamy eyes moved past Mr._Skyros ' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground_glass window . 
16526	br-l08	16	61	359455	`` I appreciate it , you do that . 
16527	br-l08	16	62	359464	Sure . 
16528	br-l08	16	63	359466	We do n't none of us want no trouble . 
16529	br-l08	16	64	359476	I 'm in a room over the Golden_Club on San_Pedro , you just ask for me there , you want see me . 
16530	br-l08	16	65	359499	Or maybe I call you - tonight ? 
16531	br-l08	16	66	359507	About nine o ' clock , I call and see if you got any . 
16532	br-l08	16	67	359522	A couple decks for me , Mr._Skyros - and ten twelve to sell , see , I like to have a little ready cash '' . 
16533	br-l08	17	68	359548	`` Oh , now , I do n't know about that much '' , said Mr._Skyros . 
16534	br-l08	17	69	359565	`` And you know , Angelo , Pretty , he always keeps it a strict cash_basis , like they say '' - 
16535	br-l08	18	70	359587	`` Sure '' , said Angie . 
16536	br-l08	18	71	359594	`` Sure , Mr._Skyros . 
16537	br-l08	18	72	359599	Fifty a throw , that the deal ? 
16538	br-l08	18	73	359607	Sure . 
16539	br-l08	18	74	359609	I bring you the cash , say five_hundred for ten decks . 
16540	br-l08	18	75	359621	Never mind how much I cut it , how much I get '' , and he smiled his sleepy smile again . 
16541	br-l08	18	76	359643	`` Standard deal , Mr._Skyros . 
16542	br-l08	18	77	359649	You go ' n ' have_a_look round for it '' . 
16543	br-l08	19	78	359660	`` I do my best '' , said Mr._Skyros earnestly , `` just for you , my friend . 
16544	br-l08	19	79	359679	This is awkward for everybody , is n't it , we all got to put_up with inconvenience sometimes . 
16545	br-l08	19	80	359698	But I do my best for you '' . 
16546	br-l08	19	81	359707	He got_out of there in a hurry , brushing past another man in the door , mopping his brow . 
16547	br-l08	20	82	359727	The expedient thing - yes , very true , one must make_do as one could , in some situations . 
16548	br-l08	20	83	359747	It could all be straightened_out later . 
16549	br-l08	20	84	359754	Not very_much later , but when things had settled_down a_little . 
16550	br-l08	20	85	359765	After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went_through . 
16551	br-l08	20	86	359774	An ace_of_spades . 
16552	br-l08	20	87	359777	He was not a superstitious man , but he felt perhaps there was a little something in_that , indeed . 
16553	br-l08	20	88	359797	He rather wished he had never got_into the business , and still - scarcely to be resisted , a nice little profit with not much work involved , easy_money . 
16554	br-l08	21	89	359827	Katya_Roslev , who would be Katharine_Ross so very soon now , rang_up her first sale of the day and counted back the change . 
16555	br-l08	21	90	359851	She did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned_away without a smile or a word of thanks . 
16556	br-l08	21	91	359872	Usually she marked the few who did thank_you , you did n't get that kind much in a place like this : and she played a little game with herself , seeing how downright rude she could act to the others , before they 'd take offense , threaten to call the manager . 
16557	br-l08	21	92	359926	Funny how seldom they did : used_to it , probably . 
16558	br-l08	21	93	359937	The kind who came into a cheap store like this ! 
16559	br-l08	21	94	359948	Grab , snatch , I saw that first ! 
16560	br-l08	21	95	359957	and , Here , I 'll take this , I was before her , you wait_on me now or I do n't bother with it , see ! 
16561	br-l08	21	96	359985	This kind of place . 
16562	br-l08	22	97	359990	She 'd be through here , just no time at_all - leave this kind of thing ' way behind . 
16563	br-l08	22	98	360010	Off at noon , and she 'd never come_back . 
16564	br-l08	22	99	360020	Never have to . 
16565	br-l08	22	100	360024	Money - a_lot of money , enough . 
16566	br-l08	22	101	360032	She 'd be smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bills so 's nobody would suspect - maybe could n't get it until Monday account_of that , the banks - But that was n't really long to wait . 
16567	br-l08	22	102	360077	Not when she 'd waited so long already . 
16568	br-l08	23	103	360086	No need say anything at_all to the old_woman . 
16569	br-l08	23	104	360095	She had it all planned out , how she 'd do . 
16570	br-l08	23	105	360107	She 'd say she did n't feel good on Sunday , could n't go_to church - there 'd be a little argument , but she could be stubborn - and when the old_woman had gone , quick pack the things she 'd need to take , all but the dress she 'd wear Monday , and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight , for a dime . 
16571	br-l08	23	106	360187	Then on Monday morning - or it might have to be Tuesday - get_up and leave just the usual time , and last thing , put the money in an envelope under the old_woman 's purse there in the drawer . 
16572	br-l08	23	107	360228	She would n't be going_to get that for an hour or_so after Katya had left , go do the daily shopping . 
16573	br-l08	23	108	360250	No need leave a note with it , either - or maybe just something like , Do n't worry about me , I 'm going_away to make a better life . 
16574	br-l08	24	109	360281	A better life . 
16575	br-l08	24	110	360285	Escape . 
16576	br-l08	24	111	360287	It was n't as if she wanted much . 
16577	br-l08	24	112	360296	She did n't mind working hard , not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft - all she wanted was a chance , where she was n't marked as what she was . 
16578	br-l08	24	113	360335	To be Katharine_Ross , and work in a nicer shop somewhere , at a_little more money so she could have prettier clothes , and learn ladies ' manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up_to_now , not just the ones like her here , with foreign sounding names , the ones went_to the same church and - Different place , different job , different people , she 'd be all different too . 
16579	br-l08	24	114	360414	Prettier , she 'd do her hair another way ; smarter , and wear different kinds of clothes - she 'd be Katharine_Ross , just what that sounded like . 
16580	br-l08	25	115	360444	`` You 've give me the wrong change '' , said the customer sharply . 
16581	br-l08	25	116	360459	`` Think I can n't count '' ? 
16582	br-l08	26	117	360467	Katya made_up the amount in indifferent silence . 
16583	br-l08	26	118	360475	She was listening to other voices , out of the future . 
16584	br-l08	26	119	360487	Some of those vaguely imagined new , different people . 
16585	br-l08	26	120	360497	Oh , Katharine 's awfully nice , and pretty too , I like Katharine . 
16586	br-l08	26	121	360512	Let 's ask Katharine to go_with us , she 's always lots_of fun . 
16587	br-l08	26	122	360526	Katharine . 
16588	br-l08	27	123	360528	Soon , very soon now & & & . 
16589	br-l08	28	124	360537	Mendoza did n't wake until nearly nine thirty . 
16590	br-l08	28	125	360546	It was going_to be another hot day ; already the thermometer stood close_to ninety . 
16591	br-l08	28	126	360561	Alison was still sound asleep ; he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk drawers for more cigarettes before thinking_of her handbag , and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom , which tasted peculiarly of face_powder . 
16592	br-l08	28	127	360602	He left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today , and drove home . 
16593	br-l08	29	128	360622	After he 'd got_out fresh liver for Bast , he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish . 
16594	br-l08	29	129	360643	Surely she was just a_trifle fatter around the middle ? 
16595	br-l08	29	130	360653	He seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters , and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens . 
16596	br-l08	29	131	360679	`` Y_que_sigue_despues ? 
16597	br-l08	29	132	360682	- what then '' ? he asked her severely . 
16598	br-l08	29	133	360692	`` A lot of people are so peculiar that they do n't like cats , it 's not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens - and , damn_it , you know very_well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away ! 
16599	br-l08	29	134	360743	And I suppose now that you 've finally grown_up , if a_little late , you 'd go_on producing kittens every six months or_so . 
16600	br-l08	29	135	360767	Yes , well , it 's a pity to spoil your girlish figure - which all those kittens would do anyway - but I think when you 've raised these we 'll just have the vet fix it so there won n't be any more . 
16601	br-l08	29	136	360813	I wonder if the Carters would take one . 
16602	br-l08	29	137	360822	And it 's no good looking at me like that '' , as she wound affectionately around his ankles . 
16603	br-l09	1	1	360842	Maude 's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up . 
16604	br-l09	1	2	360850	`` Happened to be in the hall ! 
16605	br-l09	1	3	360858	Happened to hear you quarrel about her ! 
16606	br-l09	1	4	360866	Oh , well , you can n't really blame Lolotte . 
16607	br-l09	1	5	360877	She lost her beau to you '' . 
16608	br-l09	2	6	360885	But she was talking of Emile when she saw the black line of the open door ; Sarah remembered it clearly . 
16609	br-l09	2	7	360907	Maude went_on . 
16610	br-l09	2	8	360910	`` I 've got to get busy . 
16611	br-l09	2	9	360918	Miss_Celie 's taken to her bed , with the door locked . 
16612	br-l09	2	10	360930	She opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you . 
16613	br-l09	2	11	360946	Here '' - She thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into Sarah 's hand . 
16614	br-l09	2	12	360966	`` Not that there 's much use in locking_up the smokehouse and the storehouse now . 
16615	br-l09	2	13	360982	Drink your coffee '' - 
16616	br-l09	3	14	360987	Coffee . 
16617	br-l09	3	15	360989	`` It 's - cold '' . 
16618	br-l09	3	16	360996	Maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat . 
16619	br-l09	3	17	361008	`` I do n't want it '' , Sarah said , firmly . 
16620	br-l09	4	18	361021	`` Oh . 
16621	br-l09	4	19	361024	Well - I 'll take it down with me as I go '' . 
16622	br-l09	5	20	361038	Maude swooped_up the cup and hiked_up her top hoop as if about to take_off with a racing start . 
16623	br-l09	5	21	361057	At the door she turned back , her Roman_nose looking very long now and satiric . 
16624	br-l09	5	22	361073	`` I forgot . 
16625	br-l09	5	23	361077	Ben and Lucien have gone_after them . 
16626	br-l09	5	24	361084	It 's just like that book your Northern friend wrote - except there are n't any ice_floes to cross and no bloodhounds '' . 
16627	br-l09	6	25	361108	`` I do n't know Mrs._Stowe . 
16628	br-l09	6	26	361115	What can they do if they find them '' ? 
16629	br-l09	7	27	361125	`` They can n't do anything . 
16630	br-l09	7	28	361132	It 's silly , childish , running after them like that . 
16631	br-l09	7	29	361144	I told Ben so . 
16632	br-l09	7	30	361149	But of_course the paterollers won n't be of any help , not with everything so upset and that Yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around , God_knows_where '' . 
16633	br-l09	8	31	361179	She had swished away , she had been gone for a long_time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought_to stop her , pour_out the coffee , so no_one would drink it . 
16634	br-l09	8	32	361212	But_then the so-called coffee was bad enough at_best , cold it was all_but undrinkable - especially that cup ! 
16635	br-l09	9	33	361231	She was deeply , horribly sure that Lucien had filled it with opium . 
16636	br-l09	9	34	361245	She had quarreled with Lucien , she had resisted his demands for money - and if she died , by the provisions of her marriage_contract , Lucien would inherit legally not_only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office , but later , when the war was over , her father 's entire estate . 
16637	br-l09	10	35	361303	She felt cold and hot , sticky and chilly at_the_same_time . 
16638	br-l09	10	36	361314	Now wait a minute , she told herself , think_about it ; Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee . 
16639	br-l09	11	37	361344	She had lost a bottle of opium - but that was on the trip from New_Orleans . 
16640	br-l09	11	38	361361	Or someone had taken it during her first day at Honotassa . 
16641	br-l09	11	39	361373	Yes , she had missed it after her talk with Emile , after dinner , just before Emile was shot . 
16642	br-l09	11	40	361394	Rilly or Glendora had entered her room while she slept , bringing back her washed clothes . 
16643	br-l09	11	41	361411	So somebody else could have come_in , too - then or later while she was out of the room . 
16644	br-l09	11	42	361431	It would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor . 
16645	br-l09	12	43	361444	It was not very reasonable to believe that Lucien had procured unprocurable opium and come_back to Honotassa with a formed plan to murder her . 
16646	br-l09	12	44	361469	He did n't even know that she was there . 
16647	br-l09	12	45	361479	And he certainly could n't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the yielding - yes , and credible fool he had every right to expect . 
16648	br-l09	12	46	361515	No , he had been surprised , unpleasantly surprised , but surprised . 
16649	br-l09	13	47	361528	Then somebody else ? 
16650	br-l09	13	48	361532	Do n't question , Rev had said , do n't invite danger . 
16651	br-l09	13	49	361545	Her skin crawled : Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open . 
16652	br-l09	13	50	361565	Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile , she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall . 
16653	br-l09	13	51	361606	So Lolotte - or anybody - could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied_with the missing bottle of opium . 
16654	br-l09	14	52	361630	That was not reasonable either . 
16655	br-l09	14	53	361636	The opium had disappeared before Emile 's death and whoever shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen Sarah 's own doubts and suspicions - and questions . 
16656	br-l09	15	54	361668	She began to doubt whether there had been in_fact a lethal_dose of opium in the cup . 
16657	br-l09	15	55	361685	So suppose somebody only wished to frighten her , so she would leave Honotassa ! 
16658	br-l09	16	56	361700	That made a certain amount of logic . 
16659	br-l09	16	57	361708	Added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot , she might even have drunk some of it , she would n't have taken enough to kill her , for she would have been warned by its taste . 
16660	br-l09	17	58	361759	No . 
16661	br-l09	17	59	361761	It was merely an attempt to frighten her . 
16662	br-l09	18	60	361770	She would n't go_back to New_York as Maude suggested ; she would n't run like a scared cat . 
16663	br-l09	18	61	361789	But - well , she 'd be very careful . 
16664	br-l09	19	62	361799	She dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life . 
16665	br-l09	20	63	361815	But before she left her room she dug_into her big moire bag , took_out the envelope holding her marriage_contract and the wax seal had been broken . 
16666	br-l09	20	64	361842	So somebody else knew what would happen to her father 's money if she died . 
16667	br-l09	21	65	361858	Rev had known all_along . 
16668	br-l09	21	66	361863	Rev did n't need to break the wax seal , read the contract and find_out . 
16669	br-l09	21	67	361879	He could conceivably have wished to make sure ; Rev loved Honotassa , it was like a part of his breath and body ; Rev had stressed the need for money . 
16670	br-l09	21	68	361911	Rev would never have tried to give her poison ! 
16671	br-l09	22	69	361921	She thrust the envelope back in the bag ; there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now , it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen . 
16672	br-l09	22	70	361955	And in_all_likelihood , by now , there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage_contract . 
16673	br-l09	22	71	361978	There was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she 'd been . 
16674	br-l09	23	72	361994	She went downstairs and received another curious shock , for when Glendora flapped into the dining_room in her homemade moccasins , Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she had n't . 
16675	br-l09	23	73	362033	`` Too much work this morning , Miss_Sarah - everybody gone like that '' - 
16676	br-l09	24	74	362048	Sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction in her throat . 
16677	br-l09	24	75	362059	`` Well , then who brought it '' ? 
16678	br-l09	25	76	362068	`` Miss Maude . 
16679	br-l09	25	77	362072	She come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you '' . 
16680	br-l09	25	78	362087	Glendora put_down a dish of lukewarm rice . 
16681	br-l09	25	79	362095	`` Not much breakfast this morning . 
16682	br-l09	25	80	362102	I do n't know what we 're going_to do , Miss_Sarah '' . 
16683	br-l09	26	81	362115	`` We 've got to eat '' , Sarah said , curtly , because a chill crawled over her again . 
16684	br-l09	26	82	362136	Maude ? 
16685	br-l09	27	83	362138	Glendora flapped away . 
16686	br-l09	27	84	362142	The rice was n't dosed with opium , indeed it had no taste at_all , not a grain of salt . 
16687	br-l09	27	85	362163	She ate what she could and went_out along the covered passageway , with the rain dripping from the vines . 
16688	br-l09	27	86	362183	In the kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking chickens . 
16689	br-l09	27	87	362192	`` Get a basket '' , Sarah told her . 
16690	br-l09	27	88	362202	`` We 'll go_to the storehouse '' . 
16691	br-l09	28	89	362210	Glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers , and went with her through the drizzle , to the storehouse . 
16692	br-l09	28	90	362232	Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door . 
16693	br-l09	29	91	362242	It was a long , low room , like a root_cellar , for it was banked up with soil , and vines had run rampant over that , too . 
16694	br-l09	29	92	362272	It was dark but dry and cool . 
16695	br-l09	29	93	362280	She doled_out what Glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried peas , eggs , cornmeal , a little salt . 
16696	br-l09	29	94	362302	The shelves looked emptier than when Miss_Celie had shown her the storeroom , and since the men from the Commissary had called ; there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with . 
16697	br-l09	29	95	362342	She took Glendora to the smokehouse , unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of hams and sides of bacon , hanging from the smoke stained rafters . 
16698	br-l09	30	96	362374	They would n't go hungry , not_yet . 
16699	br-l09	30	97	362382	And the fields were green and growing . 
16700	br-l09	30	98	362390	`` Ca n't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like , here '' ? 
16701	br-l09	30	99	362407	Maude had said . 
16702	br-l09	31	100	362411	Maude . 
16703	br-l09	32	101	362413	She sent Glendora back to the house , her basket and her apron laden . 
16704	br-l09	32	102	362428	She stood for a moment , rain dripping from the trees over her head , thinking_of Maude . 
16705	br-l09	33	103	362446	Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from Sarah 's room . 
16706	br-l09	33	104	362461	Maude had the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she made up her mind to do . 
16707	br-l09	33	105	362477	She could n't see how her death could affect Maude . 
16708	br-l09	33	106	362488	She could n't see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten her . 
16709	br-l09	33	107	362502	Besides , there was something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her . 
16710	br-l09	33	108	362521	Maude was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish . 
16711	br-l09	34	109	362538	Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New_York . 
16712	br-l09	34	110	362548	Maude could have shot Emile - if she 'd had a reason to kill him . 
16713	br-l09	35	111	362564	There was no use in standing there in the drizzle , trying to find a link between Emile 's murder and opium in a cup of coffee . 
16714	br-l09	36	112	362592	She started back for the house , saw a light in the office , opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder . 
16715	br-l09	36	113	362628	Rev , George and Lolotte were mending shoes . 
16716	br-l09	37	114	362637	a lighted lamp stood on the table that dusky , drizzling day . 
16717	br-l09	37	115	362650	They were all three bent over a shabby riding_boot ; George had a tack_hammer . 
16718	br-l09	37	116	362665	Lolotte held a patch of leather , Rev steadied something , a tiny brad , waiting for George 's poised hammer . 
16719	br-l09	37	117	362687	George said , `` First thing I do when I get to Vicksburg again , is get me a Yankee '' - 
16720	br-l09	38	118	362709	`` With boots on '' , Lolotte laughed_softly . 
16721	br-l09	39	119	362718	Rev looked up and saw her . 
16722	br-l09	39	120	362725	Lolotte looked up and stiffened . 
16723	br-l09	39	121	362731	George did n't look up at_all . 
16724	br-l09	39	122	362738	There was no way to know , no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at Sarah 's appearance , believing her to be drugged and senseless - and just possibly dead . 
16725	br-l09	40	123	362774	Rev said , `` Come in , Sarah . 
16726	br-l09	40	124	362783	Reckon you know the news '' . 
16727	br-l09	41	125	362790	And what news , Sarah thought as satirically as Maude might have said it . 
16728	br-l09	42	126	362805	Rev 's face was suddenly a_little fixed and questioning . 
16729	br-l09	42	127	362815	He turned_to George and Lolotte . 
16730	br-l09	42	128	362821	`` Take your cobbler 's shop somewhere else . 
16731	br-l09	42	129	362830	I want to talk to Sarah '' . 
16732	br-l09	43	130	362838	Everything in the office , the spreading circle of lamplight , the patch of leather in Lolotte 's hands . 
16733	br-l09	43	131	362858	George poised with the tack_hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all denied an attempt at murder . 
16734	br-l09	43	132	362877	A rush of panic caught Sarah . 
16735	br-l09	43	133	362884	`` No . 
16736	br-l09	43	134	362887	Not now . 
16737	br-l09	43	135	362890	I mean I 've got_to - to see to the kitchen . 
16738	br-l09	43	136	362902	Glendora '' - 
16739	br-l09	44	137	362905	Her words jumbled together and she all_but ran from the office and from the question in Rev 's face . 
16740	br-l09	45	138	362925	Now why did I do that ? 
16741	br-l09	45	139	362932	she thought as warm , drizzling rain touched her face . 
16742	br-l09	45	140	362943	She was no schoolgirl , refusing to bear tales . 
16743	br-l09	46	141	362953	As she reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself ; if she told anyone of the opium it must be Lucien , her husband . 
16744	br-l09	47	142	362979	It might be , indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love , but it was marriage . 
16745	br-l09	47	143	363000	So she could n't choose Rev as a confidant ; it must be Lucien . 
16746	br-l09	48	144	363015	Always provided_that Lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium , she thought , as coldly and sharply , again , as Maude might have said it . 
16747	br-l09	49	145	363044	She paused at the kitchen door , caught her breath , told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went_into the kitchen , where Glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and Maude was cleaning lamp_chimneys . 
16748	br-l09	49	146	363086	Glendora gave a gulp . 
16749	br-l09	49	147	363091	`` Miss_Sarah , I can n't cut_up no chicken . 
16750	br-l09	49	148	363101	Miss_Maude say she won n't '' . 
16751	br-l09	50	149	363108	Again the homely , everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her - or to murder her . 
16752	br-l09	51	150	363130	The homely everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency . 
16753	br-l09	51	151	363148	No_matter what had happened or had n't happened , somebody had_to see about dinner . 
16754	br-l09	51	152	363163	She eyed the chickens with , if she had known it , something of Glendora 's dismal look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on Latin verbs . 
16755	br-l10	1	1	363197	`` Not since last night . 
16756	br-l10	1	2	363203	I did n't think there was any reason to '' . 
16757	br-l10	2	3	363214	`` Maybe there is n't . 
16758	br-l10	2	4	363220	Speak to him again anyway . 
16759	br-l10	2	5	363226	Try talking to some of the fellows he works with , friends , anyone . 
16760	br-l10	2	6	363241	Try to find_out how happy he is with his wife , whether he plays_around with women . 
16761	br-l10	2	7	363258	You might try looking_into his wife too . 
16762	br-l10	2	8	363266	She might have been talking to some of her friends about her husband if they 've been having any trouble '' . 
16763	br-l10	3	9	363288	`` You think Black 's the one we 're looking_for '' ? 
16764	br-l10	4	10	363300	`` Yeah . 
16765	br-l10	4	11	363303	I think he might be '' , Conrad said grimly . 
16766	br-l10	4	12	363314	`` Then_again he might not '' . 
16767	br-l10	5	13	363321	`` What a stinking world '' , Rourke said . 
16768	br-l10	5	14	363331	`` Black is Gilborn 's best_friend '' . 
16769	br-l10	6	15	363339	`` I know '' . 
16770	br-l10	7	16	363344	`` Will you be coming_back soon '' ? 
16771	br-l10	8	17	363352	`` I think so . 
16772	br-l10	8	18	363357	I 'm on_my_way to see the Jacobs woman '' . 
16773	br-l10	9	19	363367	`` Gilborn 's secretary ? 
16774	br-l10	9	20	363372	What for ? 
16775	br-l10	9	21	363375	You do n't think Gilborn is the - '' ? 
16776	br-l10	10	22	363385	`` I do n't think anything . 
16777	br-l10	10	23	363392	I just do n't want to go_off_half_cocked before picking_up Black , that 's all '' . 
16778	br-l10	10	24	363408	Conrad interrupted . 
16779	br-l10	10	25	363411	`` Gilborn says he was in his office all day with her yesterday . 
16780	br-l10	10	26	363425	I 'd like to make sure . 
16781	br-l10	10	27	363432	Also , it 's just possible she might know something about Mrs._Gilborn '' . 
16782	br-l10	11	28	363446	`` Right . 
16783	br-l10	11	29	363449	I 'll see you later '' . 
16784	br-l10	12	30	363456	`` Are n't you ever going_to go_home '' ? 
16785	br-l10	13	31	363465	`` It sure_as_hell does n't look like it , does_it ? 
16786	br-l10	13	32	363476	I 'm telling you , if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us to , they 'd think_twice before letting themselves get knocked_off '' . 
16787	br-l10	14	33	363503	`` Remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet '' . 
16788	br-l10	15	34	363516	Conrad hung_up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench , massaging his right leg . 
16789	br-l10	16	35	363531	He looked at his watch . 
16790	br-l10	16	36	363537	It was ten minutes before eleven . 
16791	br-l10	17	37	363544	He wondered how long it would be before they had a signed confession from Lionel_Black . 
16792	br-l10	18	38	363560	Thirty years ' experience let him know , even at this early stage , that Black was his man . 
16793	br-l10	19	39	363580	But he still wanted to know why . 
16794	br-l10	20	40	363588	It was a cold , windy day , the day after Kitti 's death , but Stanley_Gilborn paid no attention to the blustery October wind . 
16795	br-l10	21	41	363614	After leaving Conrad , Gilborn had no destination . 
16796	br-l10	21	42	363623	He simply walked , not noticing where he was , not caring . 
16797	br-l10	21	43	363636	He stopped automatically at the street_corners , waiting for the traffic_lights to change , unheeding of other people , his coat open and flapping . 
16798	br-l10	22	44	363661	As he walked , he tried to think . 
16799	br-l10	23	45	363670	Of Kitti . 
16800	br-l10	23	46	363673	Of himself . 
16801	br-l10	23	47	363676	Mainly of what Conrad had tried to make him believe . 
16802	br-l10	24	48	363687	There was nothing coherent about his thinking . 
16803	br-l10	24	49	363695	It was a succession of picture images passing through his mind : the same ones , different ones , in no apparent sequence , in no logical succession . 
16804	br-l10	25	50	363724	The enormity of what Conrad had told him made it impossible for Gilborn to accept , with any degree of realism , the actuality of it . 
16805	br-l10	26	51	363751	Conrad 's words had intellectual meaning for him only . 
16806	br-l10	26	52	363761	Emotionally , they penetrated him not at_all . 
16807	br-l10	27	53	363769	Whoever_he_was and your wife were_intimate . 
16808	br-l10	28	54	363775	Gilborn remembered Conrad 's exact words . 
16809	br-l10	28	55	363782	They made_sense and yet they did n't . 
16810	br-l10	28	56	363790	He knew Conrad had told him the truth . 
16811	br-l10	28	57	363799	It was so . 
16812	br-l10	28	58	363803	Yet it was n't so . 
16813	br-l10	28	59	363809	It was n't so because it could n't be so . 
16814	br-l10	29	60	363820	When Kitti was alive - and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm - she had been the center of his life . 
16815	br-l10	30	61	363848	She was the sun , he the closest planet orbiting around her , the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed . 
16816	br-l10	31	62	363872	For fifty-five years he had lived , progressing towards a no-goal , eating , working , breathing without plan , without reason . 
16817	br-l10	32	63	363895	Kitti had come_along to justify everything . 
16818	br-l10	32	64	363902	She was his goal , she was his reason . 
16819	br-l10	32	65	363912	He had lived all his life waiting for her . 
16820	br-l10	33	66	363922	Not once , in the time that he had known her , had he ever considered the possibility , not once , not for one one-thousandth of a second , of her infidelity . 
16821	br-l10	34	67	363956	He could not consider it now . 
16822	br-l10	34	68	363963	Not really . 
16823	br-l10	34	69	363966	And so he walked , aimless again . 
16824	br-l10	35	70	363974	The walk ended , inevitably , right in front of his hotel building . 
16825	br-l10	35	71	363988	The doorman began to nod his head automatically , then remembered who Gilborn was , what had happened to him the night before . 
16826	br-l10	35	72	364012	He looked at Gilborn with undisguised curiosity . 
16827	br-l10	36	73	364020	Gilborn passed by him without seeing him . 
16828	br-l10	37	74	364028	He crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts . 
16829	br-l10	38	75	364044	In the apartment itself , all was still . 
16830	br-l10	38	76	364053	The police were no_longer there . 
16831	br-l10	38	77	364059	There was no evidence that anything was different than it had been . 
16832	br-l10	39	78	364072	Except that Kitti was n't there . 
16833	br-l10	40	79	364079	Without taking_off his coat , he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door . 
16834	br-l10	41	80	364098	At_last , sitting there , in the familiar surroundings , the truth began to sink_in . 
16835	br-l10	42	81	364114	Who ? 
16836	br-l10	43	82	364116	He felt no anger towards Kitti , no sense that she had betrayed him . 
16837	br-l10	44	83	364131	Who ? 
16838	br-l10	45	84	364133	She was all he had , everything he had , everything he wanted . 
16839	br-l10	45	85	364147	Someone had taken her away from him . 
16840	br-l10	46	86	364155	Who ? 
16841	br-l10	47	87	364157	Where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger , there is a right-hand one , he remembered from his school_days . 
16842	br-l10	48	88	364179	Where there is a victim , there is a killer . 
16843	br-l10	49	89	364190	Who ? 
16844	br-l10	50	90	364192	Whoever_he_was and your wife were_intimate . 
16845	br-l10	51	91	364198	He rose from the chair , took_off his coat . 
16846	br-l10	51	92	364208	Quickly , he went_into the bedroom . 
16847	br-l10	52	93	364215	The bed still showed signs of where Kitti had lain . 
16848	br-l10	52	94	364226	Gilborn stood there for a long_time . 
16849	br-l10	52	95	364233	He looked at the bed unblinkingly . 
16850	br-l10	53	96	364240	The bed was empty now . 
16851	br-l10	53	97	364246	Kitti would lie in it no_more . 
16852	br-l10	53	98	364253	He would lie in it no_more . 
16853	br-l10	54	99	364260	Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had lain in that same bed with & & & Who ? 
16854	br-l10	55	100	364276	For thirty minutes , Stanley_Gilborn stood there . 
16855	br-l10	56	101	364284	At the end of the half-hour , racking his brains , thinking over_and_over_again of Kitti , her friends , her past , he left the bedroom . 
16856	br-l10	57	102	364311	Who ? 
16857	br-l10	58	103	364313	He could think_of no answer . 
16858	br-l10	59	104	364319	Gilborn put_on his coat again . 
16859	br-l10	59	105	364325	Before leaving , he took one last , lingering look at the apartment . 
16860	br-l10	60	106	364339	He knew he would never see it again . 
16861	br-l10	61	107	364348	In the street , walking as quickly as he could , Stanley_Gilborn was a lone figure . 
16862	br-l10	62	108	364365	On Blanche_Jacobs , Kitti_Gilborn 's death had a quite different effect . 
16863	br-l10	62	109	364377	For Blanche , Kitti 's death was a source of guilty , but nonetheless soaring , happy hope . 
16864	br-l10	63	110	364396	In Blanche 's defense , it must be said she was unaware of the newborn hope . 
16865	br-l10	64	111	364413	If anyone had asked her , she would have described herself only as nervous and worried . 
16866	br-l10	64	112	364430	The figures on the worksheet paper in_front_of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was_all_she_could_do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter . 
16867	br-l10	65	113	364460	She wondered whether Stanley would call . 
16868	br-l10	65	114	364467	She wanted to be with him , to give him the comfort and companionship she knew he needed . 
16869	br-l10	66	115	364486	She had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out . 
16870	br-l10	66	116	364504	He had n't . 
16871	br-l10	66	117	364508	And now she was feeling sick , both from concern about Stanley and hunger . 
16872	br-l10	67	118	364523	Why had n't he called ? 
16873	br-l10	68	119	364529	Men , she reflected , even men like Stanley , are unpredictable . 
16874	br-l10	69	120	364542	She tried to think_of his unpredictable actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they were n't so many after_all . 
16875	br-l10	70	121	364566	Stanley really was quite predictable . 
16876	br-l10	70	122	364572	That was one of the things she liked about Stanley . 
16877	br-l10	70	123	364583	He was n't like so many other men . 
16878	br-l10	70	124	364592	The dentist last night , for_instance . 
16879	br-l10	70	125	364599	Dinner and the movies had been fine . 
16880	br-l10	70	126	364607	He had taken her upstairs to say good_night . 
16881	br-l10	70	127	364616	She had invited him in for coffee . 
16882	br-l10	71	128	364624	It was in the kitchen , as she was watching the kettle , waiting for the water to boil , that he had grabbed for her . 
16883	br-l10	71	129	364651	Without warning , without giving her a chance to prepare_for it . 
16884	br-l10	71	130	364663	From behind , he had put his arms on her shoulders , turned her around , and pressed her to him , so close she could n't breathe . 
16885	br-l10	72	131	364692	Later , she apologized for the long scratch across his face , tried to explain she could n't help herself , that the panic arose in her unwanted . 
16886	br-l10	72	132	364721	But he had n't understood . 
16887	br-l10	72	133	364727	When he left , she knew she would never see him again . 
16888	br-l10	73	134	364740	Stanley was n't like that . 
16889	br-l10	73	135	364746	She could always predict what Stanley was going_to do , ever since she first met him . 
16890	br-l10	74	136	364763	Except for that one morning . 
16891	br-l10	74	137	364769	The morning he walked in to announce to her , blushing , that he was married . 
16892	br-l10	74	138	364786	She thought she was going_to die . 
16893	br-l10	75	139	364793	She had assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him . 
16894	br-l10	76	140	364809	Blanche could n't remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion . 
16895	br-l10	76	141	364822	She thought it was sometime during the second week she worked for Stanley . 
16896	br-l10	76	142	364836	It was nothing that he said or did , but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him , looking_forward to his eventual proposal . 
16897	br-l10	77	143	364866	She was thirty-one years old then . 
16898	br-l10	77	144	364873	Her mother was already considerably concerned over her daughter 's future . 
16899	br-l10	77	145	364885	But Blanche had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed mother 's continued carping , had been able to resist her urgings to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony . 
16900	br-l10	78	146	364926	For Blanche , it was only a matter of time before Stanley would propose . 
16901	br-l10	78	147	364941	It was to_be_expected that Stanley would be shy , slow in taking such a momentous step . 
16902	br-l10	78	148	364958	Stanley went_along in life , she knew , convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman . 
16903	br-l10	78	149	364978	As_a_result , he never looked_for it . 
16904	br-l10	79	150	364985	But one day , she expected , he would somehow discover , without her having_to tell him , that there was such a woman in the world ; a woman who was willing to give him love , faith , and anything else a woman could give a husband . 
16905	br-l10	79	151	365035	Indeed , there was a woman who , unasked , had already given him love . 
16906	br-l10	79	152	365051	Unquestionably , Blanche loved Stanley . 
16907	br-l10	80	153	365057	And_then , unexpectedly , Stanley made his announcement . 
16908	br-l10	81	154	365066	On that first day , Blanche literally thought she was going_to die , or , at the very least , go out of her mind . 
16909	br-l10	82	155	365092	It might have been easier for her if Kitti_Walker had n't been everything that Blanche was not . 
16910	br-l10	83	156	365110	Kitti was thirty years younger than Stanley , taller than Stanley , prettier than Stanley had any right to hope for , much_less expect . 
16911	br-l10	83	157	365135	Kitti could have married a score of men . 
16912	br-l10	83	158	365144	There was no reason for her to marry someone like Stanley_Gilborn , there was no need for her to marry Stanley . 
16913	br-l10	84	159	365166	Kitti had come into the office , on somebody 's recommendation , because she needed help in preparing her income_tax_return . 
16914	br-l10	85	160	365187	Stanley had filled_out the return and because , when he was finished , it was close to the lunch hour , he had politely asked Kitti to join him , never expecting her to accept . 
16915	br-l10	86	161	365223	Blanche knew all this because the door to Stanley 's office was open and , without straining too hard , she could hear everything that was said . 
16916	br-l10	87	162	365251	Stanley had gone_out , saying he would be back in an hour . 
16917	br-l10	87	163	365264	He had n't come_back for over two . 
16918	br-l10	88	164	365272	After that day , Blanche still did n't know exactly what had happened . 
16919	br-l10	88	165	365286	There were mornings when Stanley came_in late , afternoons when he left early , days when he did n't come_in at_all . 
16920	br-l10	89	166	365308	Blanche knew something must be causing Stanley 's new , strange behavior but she never once connected it with Kitti_Walker . 
16921	br-l10	89	167	365329	It was too unprecedented . 
16922	br-l10	89	168	365334	Then , six weeks after the day Kitti first came into the office , Stanley announced he and Kitti were married . 
16923	br-l10	90	169	365356	Somehow , Blanche managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations . 
16924	br-l10	91	170	365370	That night the two of them left for a week 's honeymoon in Acapulco . 
16925	br-l10	92	171	365385	While they were away Blanche came into the office every morning , running things as she had always run them for Stanley , going_through the week in a dazed stupor , getting things done automatically , out of habit . 
16926	br-l10	93	172	365425	For exactly one week , she was able to continue in this manner . 
16927	br-l10	94	173	365439	On the morning of Stanley 's return , however , her strength left her . 
16928	br-l10	94	174	365454	Two hours of watching his serenely happy face , listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled figures , and Blanche had_to leave . 
16929	br-l10	95	175	365481	She stayed away for ten days . 
16930	br-l10	95	176	365488	Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had known . 
16931	br-l10	96	177	365500	Mostly , she stayed in bed . 
16932	br-l10	96	178	365507	She did n't tell anyone , even her mother , what was wrong . 
16933	br-l10	96	179	365521	She refused to have a doctor , insisting there was nothing a doctor could do for her . 
16934	br-l13	1	1	365539	His son watched until he got as far as the hall , almost out_of_sight , then hurried after . 
16935	br-l13	1	2	365558	`` Dad . 
16936	br-l13	1	3	365561	Dad , wait '' . 
16937	br-l13	2	4	365566	He caught_up_with the old_man in the living_room . 
16938	br-l13	2	5	365574	Old_man_Arthur had put_down the suitcase to open the front_door . 
16939	br-l13	3	6	365584	`` Just this one favor , Dad . 
16940	br-l13	3	7	365592	Just do n't tell Ferguson that crazy opinion of yours '' . 
16941	br-l13	4	8	365604	`` Why not '' ? 
16942	br-l13	4	9	365609	The old_man gave the room a stare in leaving ; under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory . 
16943	br-l13	4	10	365633	`` It 's the truth '' . 
16944	br-l13	5	11	365640	`` The Bartlett girl was killed by Mr._Dronk 's son . 
16945	br-l13	5	12	365651	Rossi and Ferguson have been across the street , talking to the kid . 
16946	br-l13	5	13	365665	They 've found some sort of new evidence , a bundle of clothes or something , and it must link the kid even stronger to the crime . 
16947	br-l13	5	14	365693	Why won n't you accept facts ? 
16948	br-l13	5	15	365700	The two kids were together a_lot , they were having some kind of teen-age affair - God_knows how far that had gone - and the kid 's crippled . 
16949	br-l13	5	16	365729	He limps , and the man who hit you and took the cane , he limped . 
16950	br-l13	5	17	365746	My_God , how much more do you want '' ? 
16951	br-l13	6	18	365756	His father looked him over closely . 
16952	br-l13	6	19	365763	`` You sound like an old_woman . 
16953	br-l13	6	20	365770	You should have gone_to work today , ' stead of sneaking around spying on the Dronk house '' . 
16954	br-l13	7	21	365789	`` Now , see_here '' - 
16955	br-l13	8	22	365795	`` The trouble with you '' , old_man_Arthur began , and then checked himself . 
16956	br-l13	8	23	365810	Young_Mrs._Arthur had opened the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits . 
16957	br-l13	8	24	365825	The old_man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight . 
16958	br-l13	8	25	365837	`` Is n't enough time to go into it '' , he finished , and slammed the door in his son 's face . 
16959	br-l13	9	26	365861	Mrs._Holden turned from the window draperies . 
16960	br-l13	9	27	365868	`` They found something else up there '' , she said half aloud to the empty room . 
16961	br-l13	9	28	365886	`` They took it away , overalls or something '' . 
16962	br-l13	9	29	365897	She walked restlessly across the room , then back to the windows . 
16963	br-l13	9	30	365910	`` Now they 've gone , they did n't come_back , and they did n't arrest that Dronk boy '' . 
16964	br-l13	9	31	365931	She stood frowning and chewing her lip . 
16965	br-l13	9	32	365939	She was wearing a brown cotton dress , cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look slimmer , a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below . 
16966	br-l13	9	33	365974	She smoothed the skirt , sat_down , then stood_up and went_back to the windows . 
16967	br-l13	9	34	365989	`` Why on_earth did I send him off to work ? 
16968	br-l13	9	35	366000	There was excuse enough to keep him home , that young Mr._Arthur 's still over there '' . 
16969	br-l13	10	36	366018	With sudden energy , she went to the phone and rang Holden 's office and asked for him . 
16970	br-l13	11	37	366037	`` I think you had_better come home '' . 
16971	br-l13	12	38	366046	`` Mae , we 're so busy . 
16972	br-l13	12	39	366054	Mr._Crosson 's been_on_everybody 's_neck , an order he expected did n't come_through and he 's '' - 
16973	br-l13	13	40	366071	`` I do n't care . 
16974	br-l13	13	41	366077	I want you here . 
16975	br-l13	13	42	366082	I 'm all alone and certain things are going_on that look very ominous . 
16976	br-l13	13	43	366096	I need someone to go_out and find_out what 's happening '' . 
16977	br-l13	14	44	366108	`` But I could n't do that , even if I were home '' ! 
16978	br-l13	14	45	366123	His voice grew high and trembling . 
16979	br-l13	14	46	366130	`` I can n't be underfoot every time those cops turn_around ! 
16980	br-l13	14	47	366142	They 'll think I did something '' . 
16981	br-l13	15	48	366150	He could n't see the grin that split her mouth ; the teeth that shone into the phone were like a shark 's . 
16982	br-l13	15	49	366174	`` You 'll just have to risk it . 
16983	br-l13	15	50	366183	You can n't wander along in the dark , can you ? 
16984	br-l13	15	51	366195	I 'd think that you , even more_than I , would be wondering what they 're up_to . 
16985	br-l13	15	52	366213	They found some clothes '' , she . 
16986	br-l13	16	53	366221	`` What '' ? 
16987	br-l13	17	54	366225	Deliberately , she ignored the yelp . 
16988	br-l13	17	55	366232	`` Also , that Mr._Ferguson was here . 
16989	br-l13	17	56	366240	I guess he wants to ask you some questions . 
16990	br-l13	17	57	366250	I stalled him off . 
16991	br-l13	17	58	366255	He does n't expect you until five '' . 
16992	br-l13	18	59	366264	`` Then I 'd better wait until five '' . 
16993	br-l13	19	60	366274	`` No . 
16994	br-l13	19	61	366277	Come home right_away '' . 
16995	br-l13	19	62	366282	She slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped away . 
16996	br-l13	19	63	366293	Her eyes were bright with anticipation . 
16997	br-l13	20	64	366300	In his office , Mr._Holden replaced the phone slowly . 
16998	br-l13	20	65	366310	He rose from his chair . 
16999	br-l13	20	66	366316	He had to cough then ; he went to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze on his face . 
17000	br-l13	20	67	366338	He got his hat out of the closet . 
17001	br-l13	20	68	366347	For a moment he thought_of going_into Crosson 's office to explain that he had to leave , but there was now such a pain in his chest , such a pounding in his head , that he decided to let it go . 
17002	br-l13	20	69	366390	He passed the receptionist in the outer office , muttering , `` I 've got to go_out for a little while '' . 
17003	br-l13	20	70	366413	Let her call Crosson if she wanted to , let Crosson raise_the_roof or even can him , he did n't care . 
17004	br-l13	21	71	366435	He got_into the car . 
17005	br-l13	21	72	366440	Putting the key into the switch , pressing the accelerator with his foot , putting the car into reverse , seemed vast endeavors almost beyond the ability of his shaking body . 
17006	br-l13	21	73	366472	Once out in the street , the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken . 
17007	br-l13	21	74	366490	When he turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then rose toward home , he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a_few minutes , sucking_in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear them of tears . 
17008	br-l13	22	75	366538	What on_earth was in Mae 's mind , that she wanted him up there spying on what the cops were doing ? 
17009	br-l13	22	76	366560	What did she think he could do ? 
17010	br-l13	23	77	366568	He tried to ignore what his own common_sense told him , but it was n't possible ; her motives were too blatant . 
17011	br-l13	23	78	366591	She wanted him to get_into trouble . 
17012	br-l13	23	79	366598	She wanted the police to notice him , suspect him . 
17013	br-l13	23	80	366609	She was going to keep_on scheming , poking , prodding , suggesting , and dictating until the cops got_up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions . 
17014	br-l13	23	81	366643	And he knew in that moment , with a cold sinking of despair , a dying of old hopes , that Mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors . 
17015	br-l13	23	82	366676	Nothing bald , open ; but enough . 
17016	br-l13	23	83	366684	They 'd have some suspicions to repeat to the police . 
17017	br-l13	24	84	366695	Though his inner thoughts cringed at it , he forced himself to think_back , recreating the scene in which Mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child . 
17018	br-l13	25	85	366724	It had n't amounted to anything . 
17019	br-l13	25	86	366731	There had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions . 
17020	br-l13	26	87	366742	A second scene flashed before his mind , the interior of the garage at the new house and the young Bartlett girl turning startled to meet him , the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light . 
17021	br-l13	27	88	366791	Suppose the cops somehow got hold of that ? 
17022	br-l13	28	89	366800	Well , it had n't been what it seemed , he 'd had no idea the girl was in there . 
17023	br-l13	28	90	366821	He had n't touched her . 
17024	br-l13	29	91	366827	And when he came to examine the scene , there was a certain staginess to it , it had the smell of planning , and a swift suspicion darted into his mind . 
17025	br-l13	30	92	366860	Too monstrous , of_course . 
17026	br-l13	30	93	366865	Mae would n't have plotted a thing like that . 
17027	br-l13	30	94	366875	It was just that little accidents played_into_her_hands . 
17028	br-l13	30	95	366883	Like this murder . 
17029	br-l13	31	96	366887	He leaned_on the wheel , clutching it , staring into the sunlight , and tried to bring order into his thoughts . 
17030	br-l13	31	97	366909	He felt light-headed and sick . 
17031	br-l13	31	98	366915	There was no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare . 
17032	br-l13	31	99	366928	Mae was his wife . 
17033	br-l13	31	100	366933	She was married to him for better or for worse . 
17034	br-l13	31	101	366944	She would n't be wilfully planning his destruction . 
17035	br-l13	32	102	366953	But she was . 
17036	br-l13	32	103	366957	She was . 
17037	br-l13	33	104	366960	Even as the conviction of truth roared through him , shattering his last hope of safety , he was reaching to release the hand_brake , to head up the road for home , doing her bidding . 
17038	br-l13	33	105	366997	He drove , and the road wobbled , familiar scenes crept past on either side . 
17039	br-l13	33	106	367013	He came to a stretch of old orange groves , the trees dead , some of them uprooted , and then there was an outlying shopping area , and tract houses . 
17040	br-l13	33	107	367045	He had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run_off somewhere to hide . 
17041	br-l13	33	108	367061	But he could n't imagine where . 
17042	br-l13	33	109	367068	There was really no place to go , finally , except home to Mae . 
17043	br-l13	34	110	367083	At the gate he slowed , looking_around . 
17044	br-l13	34	111	367091	Cooper was beside his car , on the curb at the right , just standing there morosely ; he did n't even look up . 
17045	br-l13	34	112	367116	Behind him on the steps of the little office sat old_man_Arthur ; he was straight , something angry in his attitude , as if he might be waiting to report something . 
17046	br-l13	34	113	367148	Holden stepped_on the gas . 
17047	br-l13	35	114	367153	A new idea drifted in from_nowhere . 
17048	br-l13	35	115	367160	He could go_to the police . 
17049	br-l13	35	116	367166	He could tell them his fears of being involved , he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how Mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him - the scene was complete in his mind at the moment , even to his own jerkings and snivelings , and Ferguson 's silent patience . 
17050	br-l13	35	117	367225	He could throw himself on the mercy of the Police_Department . 
17051	br-l13	36	118	367236	It was n't what Mae would want him to do , though . 
17052	br-l13	36	119	367249	He was sure of this . 
17053	br-l13	36	120	367255	Once he had abandoned himself to the very worst , once he had quieted all the dragons of worry and suspense , there would n't be very much for Mae to do . 
17054	br-l13	36	121	367288	At that moment , Holden almost slammed on the brakes to go_back to Cooper and ask if Ferguson was about . 
17055	br-l13	37	122	367309	It would be such a relief . 
17056	br-l13	38	123	367316	What was that old sign , supposed to be painted over a door somewhere , Abandon hope , all ye who enter here ? 
17057	br-l13	39	124	367340	Why , Holden said to himself , surprised at his own sudden insight , I 'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be . 
17058	br-l13	39	125	367371	They 've worried , they 've lain_awake nights , they 've shook at the slightest footstep , they 've pictured their own destruction , and now it 's all over and they can give_up . 
17059	br-l13	39	126	367406	Sure , they 're giving_up hope . 
17060	br-l13	39	127	367413	Hand_in_hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension . 
17061	br-l13	39	128	367423	Good-bye . 
17062	br-l13	39	129	367425	Holden waved a hand at the empty street . 
17063	br-l13	39	130	367434	Glad to see you go . 
17064	br-l13	40	131	367440	He drove into the paved space before the garage and got_out , slamming the car_door . 
17065	br-l13	40	132	367456	He looked up and down the street . 
17066	br-l13	40	133	367464	If Ferguson 's car had been in_sight , Holden would have walked directly to it . 
17067	br-l13	41	134	367480	He went to the front_door and opened it and looked in . 
17068	br-l13	42	135	367492	Mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen . 
17069	br-l13	42	136	367503	She had a cup of something steaming , coffee perhaps , in one hand , a fresh piece of toast in the other . 
17070	br-l13	42	137	367527	She stood there , watching Holden come_in , and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit_off one corner with a huge chomp of her white teeth . 
17071	br-l13	43	138	367558	`` Mae '' - 
17072	br-l13	44	139	367562	`` I 've been thinking '' , she said , swallowing the toast . 
17073	br-l13	44	140	367576	`` Did n't you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage ? 
17074	br-l13	44	141	367591	You used them that time you painted the porch at our other house . 
17075	br-l13	44	142	367605	And then you wiped_up some grease '' . 
17076	br-l13	45	143	367613	She had caught him off_guard , no preparation , nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster . 
17077	br-l13	45	144	367633	`` No . 
17078	br-l13	45	145	367636	Wait a minute . 
17079	br-l13	45	146	367640	What do you '' - 
17080	br-l13	46	147	367645	`` I 've been looking_for them , and they 're gone . 
17081	br-l13	46	148	367657	I 'm sure they were in the garage up until a_couple_of days ago . 
17082	br-l13	46	149	367671	Or even yesterday . 
17083	br-l13	46	150	367675	You used to paint in them , and then you just took them for rags . 
17084	br-l13	46	151	367691	The police have them now '' . 
17085	br-l13	47	152	367698	`` I do n't remember any overalls at_all '' . 
17086	br-l13	48	153	367708	`` They were all faded . 
17087	br-l13	48	154	367714	Worn through at the knees '' . 
17088	br-l13	48	155	367721	She stood sipping and chewing and watching . 
17089	br-l13	48	156	367729	`` Green paint , was n't it ? 
17090	br-l13	48	157	367737	Well , I 'm not sure of the color . 
17091	br-l13	48	158	367747	But you had them '' . 
17092	br-l13	49	159	367753	`` Mae , sit_down . 
17093	br-l13	49	160	367758	Put_down the cup of coffee . 
17094	br-l13	49	161	367764	Tell me what this is all about '' . 
17095	br-l13	50	162	367773	She shook her head . 
17096	br-l13	50	163	367778	She took another bite of toast . 
17097	br-l13	50	164	367785	Holden noticed almost absently how she chewed , how the whole side of her cheek moved , a slab of fat that extended down into her neck . 
17098	br-l13	50	165	367813	`` My_goodness , you ought to remember if I do . 
17099	br-l13	50	166	367824	You 're going_to have to go to the police and explain what happened . 
17100	br-l13	50	167	367838	Tell them the truth , or something , before they come here '' . 
17101	br-l13	51	168	367852	A seeping coldness entered Holden 's being ; his nerves seemed frost-bitten down to the tips of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass like , liable to break like an icicle at any moment . 
17102	br-l13	51	169	367891	`` I 've never owned any painting overalls . 
17103	br-l14	1	1	367900	A man with a sketch_pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long , dim corridor and made pencil lines on_paper and said , `` Is this more like it , Mrs._MacReady ? 
17104	br-l14	1	2	367943	Or are the eyebrows more like this '' ? 
17105	br-l14	1	3	367952	When he had finished with that , he would go_to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else , most probably a busboy . 
17106	br-l14	1	4	367982	`` Begin to look_like him now , would you say ? 
17107	br-l14	1	5	367993	Different about the mouth , huh ? 
17108	br-l14	1	6	368000	More like this , maybe '' ? 
17109	br-l14	2	7	368007	Men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth floor of the Hotel_Dumont and blew it off again , and did the same in a tiny , almost airless room in a tenement in the West_Forties . 
17110	br-l14	2	8	368046	And men also used vacuum_cleaners in both rooms , sucking dust up once_more . 
17111	br-l14	3	9	368060	Men from the Third_Detective_District , Eighteenth_Precinct , had the longest , the most tedious , job . 
17112	br-l14	3	10	368077	At the Hotel_Dumont there had , at the time in_issue , been twenty-three overnighters , counting couples as singular . 
17113	br-l14	3	11	368097	These included , as one , Mr. and Mrs._Anthony_Payne , who had checked_in a little after noon the day before , and had not checked_out together . 
17114	br-l14	3	12	368124	But Gardner_Willings was not included ; he had been at the Dumont for almost a week . 
17115	br-l14	3	13	368141	There was , of_course , no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel . 
17116	br-l14	3	14	368166	The twenty-three ( or twenty-two with the Paynes themselves omitted ) provided merely a place to start , and their identification was the barest of starts . 
17117	br-l14	3	15	368193	With names and addresses listed , verification came next . 
17118	br-l14	3	16	368203	It would take time ; it would , almost inevitably , trouble_some_water . 
17119	br-l14	3	17	368216	( `` I certainly was not at the Dumont last night and my husband could n't have been . 
17120	br-l14	3	18	368235	He 's in Boston . 
17121	br-l14	3	19	368240	Of_course he 's in '' - ) 
17122	br-l14	4	20	368247	The Hotel_King_Arthur across the street provided almost twice as_many problems . 
17123	br-l14	4	21	368258	The King_Arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and did n't want - heaven_knew did n't want ! 
17124	br-l14	4	22	368286	- to lunge anxiously through crowded streets to railroad_stations and , at odd hours of night , drive from smaller stations to distant homes , probably through rain or , in November , something worse . 
17125	br-l14	4	23	368322	The King_Arthur was less expensive than the Dumont . 
17126	br-l14	4	24	368331	The King_Arthur had fifty-four overnighters , again counting rooms rather than people . 
17127	br-l14	5	25	368344	Check the overnighters out . 
17128	br-l14	5	26	368349	Failing to find what was wanted , as was most likely , check_out other guests , with special - but not exclusive - attention to those with rooms on the street . 
17129	br-l14	5	27	368381	( Anyone active enough can reach a roof , wherever his room may be . ) 
17130	br-l14	5	28	368397	And know , while all this went_on , that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel . 
17131	br-l14	5	29	368424	It was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel . 
17132	br-l14	5	30	368438	There were other roofs , less convenient but not impossible . 
17133	br-l14	5	31	368449	It is dull business , detecting , and hard on feet . 
17134	br-l14	6	32	368461	There was also the one salient question to ask , and ask widely : Did you notice anything out_of_the_way ? 
17135	br-l14	6	33	368481	Like , for_example , a man carrying a twenty-two_rifle , probably with a telescopic_sight attached ? 
17136	br-l14	7	34	368497	There was , of_course , no hope it really would be that simple . 
17137	br-l14	7	35	368511	The sniper , whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent , would hardly have walked to his vantage_point with rifle over shoulder , whistling a marching tune . 
17138	br-l14	7	36	368539	Anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle ? 
17139	br-l14	7	37	368548	Long thin suitcase ? 
17140	br-l14	7	38	368552	Or long fat suitcase , for_that_matter ? 
17141	br-l14	7	39	368559	Shrugs met that , from room_clerks , from bellhops . 
17142	br-l14	7	40	368569	Who measures ? 
17143	br-l14	7	41	368572	But nothing , it appeared , long enough to attract attention . 
17144	br-l14	7	42	368584	Cases , say , for musical_instruments ? 
17145	br-l14	7	43	368591	None noted at the Dumont . 
17146	br-l14	7	44	368597	Several at the King_Arthur . 
17147	br-l14	7	45	368602	A combo was staying there . 
17148	br-l14	7	46	368608	And had been for a week . 
17149	br-l14	7	47	368615	Anything else ? 
17150	br-l14	7	48	368618	Anything at all ? 
17151	br-l14	7	49	368622	Shrugs met that . 
17152	br-l14	8	50	368626	( Detective_Pearson , Eighteenth_Precinct , thought for a time he might be_on_to_something . 
17153	br-l14	8	51	368639	A refuse bin at the Dumont turned_up a florist 's box - a very long box for very long stemmed flowers . 
17154	br-l14	8	52	368661	Traces of oil on green tissue ? 
17155	br-l14	8	53	368668	The lab to check . 
17156	br-l14	8	54	368673	The lab : Sorry . 
17157	br-l14	8	55	368678	No oil . ) 
17158	br-l14	9	56	368682	Anything at all strange ? 
17159	br-l14	10	57	368687	Well , a man had tried , at the King_Arthur , to register with an ocelot . 
17160	br-l14	10	58	368704	At the Dumont , a guest had come in a collapsible wheel_chair . 
17161	br-l14	10	59	368717	At the King_Arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged , and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches . 
17162	br-l14	10	60	368741	There had also been a man who must have had St._Vitus or something , because he kept jerking his head . 
17163	br-l14	11	61	368762	As reports dribbled in , William_Weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head . 
17164	br-l14	11	62	368779	Mullins came_in . 
17165	br-l14	11	63	368782	There was no sign of Mrs._Lauren_Payne at her house on Nod_Road , Ridgefield , Connecticut . 
17166	br-l14	11	64	368798	The house was modern , large , on five acres . 
17167	br-l14	11	65	368809	Must have cost plenty . 
17168	br-l14	11	66	368814	The State cops would check from_time_to_time ; pass word when there was word to pass . 
17169	br-l14	11	67	368830	Weigand tossed this news into the centrifuge . 
17170	br-l14	11	68	368838	Sort things out , damn_it . 
17171	br-l14	11	69	368844	Sort_out the next move . 
17172	br-l14	12	70	368849	Try to forget motive for_the_moment . 
17173	br-l14	12	71	368855	Consider opportunity . 
17174	br-l14	12	72	368858	Only those actually with Payne when he was shot , or who had left the party within not more_than five minutes ( make five arbitrary ) positively had none . 
17175	br-l14	12	73	368888	The Norths ; Hathaway , Jerry 's publicity director ; Livingston_Birdwood , producer of Uprising . 
17176	br-l14	12	74	368904	They had been with Payne when he was shot , could not therefore have shot him from above . 
17177	br-l14	13	75	368923	Take Gardner_Willings . 
17178	br-l14	13	76	368926	He had left after the scuffle ; had been seen to leave . 
17179	br-l14	13	77	368939	He would have had ample time to go_into a blind somewhere and wait his prey . 
17180	br-l14	13	78	368955	Consider him seriously , therefore ? 
17181	br-l14	13	79	368961	Intangibles entered , then - hunches which felt like facts . 
17182	br-l14	13	80	368972	Willings would ambush , certainly ; Willings undoubtedly had . 
17183	br-l14	13	81	368982	Willings was , presumably , a better than average shot . 
17184	br-l14	13	82	368993	But - hunch , now - Willings would not ambush anything which went on two legs instead of four . 
17185	br-l14	13	83	369013	Because , if for no other reason , Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger , tougher , than anything else that went on two legs . 
17186	br-l14	13	84	369044	Ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a tiger . 
17187	br-l14	14	85	369061	Faith_Constable had had to `` go_on '' from the party and had , presumably , gone_on . 
17188	br-l14	14	86	369078	To be checked_out further . 
17189	br-l14	14	87	369083	Forget motive ? 
17190	br-l14	14	88	369086	No , motive is a part of fact . 
17191	br-l14	14	89	369095	Nobody in_his_right_mind punishes a quarter-century old dereliction . 
17192	br-l14	14	90	369103	Grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind . 
17193	br-l14	14	91	369115	Faith_Constable had accomplished much in a quarter of a century . 
17194	br-l14	14	92	369126	Jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong ? 
17195	br-l14	14	93	369136	Bill shook his head . 
17196	br-l14	14	94	369141	Also , he thought , I doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun . 
17197	br-l14	15	95	369161	Lauren herself ? 
17198	br-l14	15	96	369164	She had left the party early , pleading a headache . 
17199	br-l14	15	97	369175	No lack of opportunity , presuming she had a gun . 
17200	br-l14	15	98	369186	She might , conceivably , have brought one in in a large enough suitcase . 
17201	br-l14	15	99	369201	( Check on the Payne luggage . ) 
17202	br-l14	15	100	369209	She might now have taken it away again . 
17203	br-l14	15	101	369218	Motive - her husband wandering ? 
17204	br-l14	15	102	369224	Bitter , unreasoning jealousy ? 
17205	br-l14	15	103	369229	Heaven knew it happened and hell knew it too . 
17206	br-l14	15	104	369239	But - it happened , almost always , among the primitive and , usually , among the very young . 
17207	br-l14	15	105	369259	( Call it mentally young ; call it retarded . ) 
17208	br-l14	15	106	369270	There was nothing to indicate that Lauren_Payne was primitive . 
17209	br-l14	15	107	369280	She did not move in primitive circles . 
17210	br-l14	15	108	369288	She was young , but not that young . 
17211	br-l14	16	109	369297	It occurred to Bill_Weigand that he was , on a hunch basis , eliminating a good many . 
17212	br-l14	16	110	369315	He reminded himself that all eliminations were tentative . 
17213	br-l14	16	111	369324	He also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities . 
17214	br-l14	17	112	369337	The Masons , mother or son , or mother and son ? 
17215	br-l14	17	113	369349	Opportunity was obvious . 
17216	br-l14	17	114	369353	Motive . 
17217	br-l14	17	115	369355	Here , too , the cause to hate lay well back in the years . 
17218	br-l14	17	116	369370	But bitterness had more cause to remain , even increasingly to corrode . 
17219	br-l14	17	117	369383	With the boy , particularly . 
17220	br-l14	17	118	369389	The boy had , apparently - if Mrs._MacReady was right in what she had told Mullins - only in recent months been forced to give_up college , to work as a busboy . 
17221	br-l14	17	119	369422	Seeing the man he blamed for this made_much_of - youth and bitterness and - 
17222	br-l14	18	120	369436	Bill picked_up the telephone ; got Mullins . 
17223	br-l14	19	121	369444	`` Send_out a pickup on Mrs._Mason and the boy when you 've got enough to go_on '' , Bill said . 
17224	br-l14	19	122	369465	`` Right '' ? 
17225	br-l14	20	123	369469	Mullins would do . 
17226	br-l14	21	124	369473	A man named Lars_Simon , playwright director , had expressed a wish that Anthony_Payne drop_dead . 
17227	br-l14	21	125	369489	He would say , of_course , that he had not really had any such wish ; that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say , lightly , meaning nothing . 
17228	br-l14	21	126	369527	Which probably would turn_out to be true ; which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say . 
17229	br-l14	22	127	369547	A man named Blaine_Smythe , with `` y '' and `` e '' but pronounced without them , had been fired at Payne 's insistence . 
17230	br-l14	22	128	369573	He was also , if Pam_North was right , a closer acquaintance of Lauren_Payne 's than she , now , was inclined to admit . 
17231	br-l14	22	129	369598	He might deny the latter ; would certainly deny any connection between the two things , or any connection of either with murder . 
17232	br-l14	22	130	369622	He would have to be given the opportunity . 
17233	br-l14	23	131	369631	Mullins ? 
17234	br-l14	23	132	369633	It was evident that Mullins was the man to go . 
17235	br-l14	23	133	369644	It was evident that a captain should remain at his desk , directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat . 
17236	br-l14	23	134	369667	Bill_Weigand was good_and_tired of the wall opposite , and the crack in the plaster . 
17237	br-l14	23	135	369682	Let Mullins keep the firm seat ; let Stein . 
17238	br-l14	24	136	369692	When Siamese_cats are intertwined it is difficult to tell where one leaves_off and another begins . 
17239	br-l14	24	137	369708	Stilts and Shadow , on Pam 's bed , appeared to be one cat - rather large , as Siamese_cats go , and , to_be_sure , having two heads and two tails . 
17240	br-l14	24	138	369741	On_the_other_hand , they , or it , seemed to have no legs whatever . 
17241	br-l14	24	139	369755	Pamela_North said , `` Hi '' , to her cats , and added that proper cats met their humans at the door . 
17242	br-l14	24	140	369778	Of four dark brown ears , one twitched slightly at this . 
17243	br-l14	24	141	369790	`` All_right '' , Pam said . 
17244	br-l14	24	142	369797	`` I know it is n't dinnertime '' . 
17245	br-l14	25	143	369806	But at this the one too-large cat suddenly became two cats , stretching . 
17246	br-l14	25	144	369820	Shadow , the more talkative , began at_once to talk , her voice piteous . 
17247	br-l14	25	145	369835	Stilts , a more direct cat , leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward the kitchen . 
17248	br-l14	25	146	369853	Shadow looked surprised , wailed , and trotted after her . 
17249	br-l14	25	147	369864	The hell it is n't dinnertime , two waving tails told Pam_North . 
17250	br-l14	26	148	369877	It was not , whatever tale was told by tails . 
17251	br-l14	26	149	369888	Martha presumably would cope . 
17252	br-l14	26	150	369893	She might be firm . 
17253	br-l14	26	151	369898	It was most unlikely that she would be firm . 
17254	br-l14	26	152	369908	They want to be fat cats , Pam thought , and lighted a cigarette and leaned_back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together . 
17255	br-l14	26	153	369934	After a time , it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble . 
17256	br-l14	26	154	369951	A vague feeling that Anthony_Payne had had_it_coming was hardly a thought and was , in_any_event , reprehensible . 
17257	br-l14	26	155	369969	Had Faith_Constable 's explanation of her confidence , so uninvited , been a_little thin ? 
17258	br-l14	26	156	369984	That was more like a thought , but not a great_deal more . 
17259	br-l14	26	157	369997	Had that tall dark boy , carrying trays too heavy for him , found what he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more_than he could bear ? 
17260	br-l14	26	158	370028	And possessed himself - how ? 
17261	br-l14	26	159	370034	- of a rifle and killed ? 
17262	br-l14	26	160	370041	Pam found she had no answers ; had only a hope . 
17263	br-l14	26	161	370053	The poor kid - the poor , frail kid . 
17264	br-l14	26	162	370063	Some people have luck and some have no luck and that , whatever people who prefer order say , is the size_of_it . 
17265	br-l14	26	163	370086	The poor , unlucky - 
17266	br-l14	27	164	370091	The telephone rang . 
17267	br-l14	27	165	370095	Pam realized , to her surprise , that she had been almost dozing . 
17268	br-l14	27	166	370109	At four o_'_clock in the afternoon . 
17269	br-l14	27	167	370116	Two martinis for lunch - that was the trouble . 
17270	br-l14	27	168	370126	I ought to remember . 
17271	br-l14	27	169	370131	Do n't pretend . 
17272	br-l14	27	170	370135	You do remember . 
17273	br-l14	27	171	370139	You just - `` Hello ? 
17274	br-l14	27	172	370145	Yes , this is she ? 
17275	br-l14	27	173	370151	What '' ? 
17276	br-l14	28	174	370154	The voice had music in it . 
17277	br-l14	28	175	370161	Even with words coming too fast , they came on the music of the voice . 
17278	br-l14	29	176	370177	`` I said I would '' , Pam said . 
17279	br-l14	29	177	370187	`` They won n't talk_about who gave the information . 
17280	br-l14	29	178	370197	Not unless they have to . 
17281	br-l14	29	179	370203	They do n't , Mrs._Constable . 
17282	br-l14	29	180	370209	Not unless they have '' - 
17283	br-l14	30	181	370215	She was interrupted . 
17284	br-l14	31	182	370219	`` Call this a cry for help '' , Faith_Constable said . 
17285	br-l15	1	1	370231	`` Through a door conveniently unlocked '' , Madden supplemented . 
17286	br-l15	2	2	370242	`` That damn door '' , said the police_chief . 
17287	br-l15	3	3	370252	`` A gift_horse to be viewed with suspicion '' . 
17288	br-l15	3	4	370262	Madden 's dark face wore a meditative look . 
17289	br-l15	3	5	370271	`` If there was collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door later . 
17290	br-l15	3	6	370299	And it makes a very poor red_herring for an inside_job . 
17291	br-l15	3	7	370310	Much better to break a cellar window '' . 
17292	br-l15	4	8	370319	`` Do n't forget , there was the hope it would pass for a natural death '' , Pauling reminded him . 
17293	br-l15	5	9	370341	`` Well , with a house as big as that there must be at_least one cellar window that would n't be noticed right_away unless there was a police_investigation '' . 
17294	br-l15	6	10	370371	`` Yeah . 
17295	br-l15	6	11	370374	And a pane_of_glass is n't hard to '' - 
17296	br-l15	7	12	370383	The telephone interrupted him . 
17297	br-l15	7	13	370388	He scooped_up the receiver and said , `` Police_chief '' , into the mouthpiece , and then , `` Oh yes , Mr._Benson . 
17298	br-l15	7	14	370412	I was hoping I 'd hear from you today '' . 
17299	br-l15	8	15	370423	With his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened , saying , `` Uh-huh '' and `` I see '' at intervals . 
17300	br-l15	9	16	370457	At_last he said , `` Well , thank_you for calling , Mr._Benson . 
17301	br-l15	9	17	370470	Although there was no doubt in my mind and we 've been handling it as one I 'm glad to have it made official '' . 
17302	br-l15	10	18	370496	He hung_up . 
17303	br-l15	10	19	370499	`` Coroner '' , he said to Madden . 
17304	br-l15	10	20	370508	`` He 's just heard from the pathologist who says Mrs._Meeker apparently died from suffocation '' . 
17305	br-l15	10	21	370525	Pauling looked at his notes . 
17306	br-l15	10	22	370531	`` Many minute hemorrhages in the lungs ; particles of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils . 
17307	br-l15	10	23	370550	Scrapings from the bed_linen identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral_cavities . 
17308	br-l15	10	24	370567	No other cause of death apparent . 
17309	br-l15	10	25	370574	Trachea clear of mucus and foreign objects . 
17310	br-l15	10	26	370582	Brain examined for thrombosis , clot or hemorrhage . 
17311	br-l15	10	27	370591	No signs of these , no gross hemorrhage of lungs , heart , brain or stomach '' . 
17312	br-l15	10	28	370609	He paused . 
17313	br-l15	10	29	370612	`` That 's_about_it . 
17314	br-l15	10	30	370616	Oh , the time of death . 
17315	br-l15	10	31	370623	The duration of the digestive process varies , the pathologist says , but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that Mrs._Meeker died several hours after her seven o_'_clock dinner . 
17316	br-l15	10	32	370659	Probably around midnight , give_or_take an hour either way '' . 
17317	br-l15	11	33	370670	Pauling paused again . 
17318	br-l15	11	34	370674	`` So there it is '' , he said . 
17319	br-l15	11	35	370684	`` Not your problem , of_course , unless Johnston and the murderer are one_and_the_same '' . 
17320	br-l15	12	36	370700	They discussed this possibility . 
17321	br-l15	12	37	370705	However likely it was , Pauling said , he could n't limit himself to it . 
17322	br-l15	12	38	370721	He had to look_for other prospects , other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to Johnston came to light . 
17323	br-l15	12	39	370741	Madden , with his investigation centered_on the fraud , said that tomorrow he would go_to the_Bronx bank through which Mrs._Meeker 's checks to Johnston had cleared . 
17324	br-l15	13	40	370768	Arthur_Williams had to be located , they agreed . 
17325	br-l15	13	41	370777	He might have been in collusion with Johnston on the fraud ; he might be Mrs._Meeker 's murderer or have played some part in her death . 
17326	br-l15	13	42	370804	This was Madden 's suggestion ; the police_chief shook his head over it . 
17327	br-l15	13	43	370818	If Arthur_Williams was involved in the fraud or the murder , then he too had another identity . 
17328	br-l15	13	44	370836	No one the Medfield police had questioned professed to know any more about him than about Johnston . 
17329	br-l15	14	45	370854	Scholarship applicant ? 
17330	br-l15	14	46	370857	Pauling looked doubtful . 
17331	br-l15	14	47	370861	Madden explained that he was thinking_of an application sent directly to Mrs._Meeker . 
17332	br-l15	14	48	370874	Then he asked to use the phone and called Brian_Thayer , who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o ' clock . 
17333	br-l15	15	49	370907	Madden said that he would see him at two and made another call , this one to Mrs._Meeker 's lawyers . 
17334	br-l15	15	50	370928	Mr._Hohlbein was out for the day , but Mr._Garth would be free at one-thirty . 
17335	br-l15	15	51	370943	The secretary 's tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice was a concession for which Madden should be duly grateful . 
17336	br-l15	16	52	370966	He inferred that Hohlbein and Garth were high-priced lawyers . 
17337	br-l15	17	53	370976	He had lunch with Pauling . 
17338	br-l15	17	54	370982	Promptly at one-thirty he entered Hohlbein and Garth 's elegant suite of offices in Medfield 's newest professional building . 
17339	br-l15	18	55	371002	He disliked Garth on sight , conservative clothes and haircut , smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties , handclasp too consciously quick and firm . 
17340	br-l15	18	56	371037	Youngish man on_the_make , Madden labeled him , and was ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions ; that Mrs._Garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer ; that there were three children , two boys and a girl ; that she was active in the Woman 's Club and he in Lions , Rotary , and Jaycee ; and finally , that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their wedding_day . 
17341	br-l15	19	57	371132	Madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also knew that he would go right on disliking Garth . 
17342	br-l15	20	58	371156	Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair , which would not , he said more than once , have ever come_about if Mrs._Meeker had only seen fit to consult Mr._Hohlbein or him about it . 
17343	br-l15	21	59	371203	Madden regretted not being able to find_fault_with so true a statement . 
17344	br-l15	21	60	371215	He asked to see a copy of Mrs._Meeker 's will . 
17345	br-l15	22	61	371226	Garth brought one out . 
17346	br-l15	23	62	371231	The date , October 8 , 1957 , immediately caught the inspector 's eye . 
17347	br-l15	23	63	371246	`` Fairly recent '' , he remarked . 
17348	br-l15	23	64	371254	`` Was she in the habit of making new wills '' ? 
17349	br-l15	24	65	371266	`` Oh no . 
17350	br-l15	24	66	371270	She had reason to change the one she made right after Mr._Meeker 's death . 
17351	br-l15	24	67	371285	Her estate had grown considerably . 
17352	br-l15	24	68	371291	She wanted to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most ; particularly the scholarship fund . 
17353	br-l15	24	69	371315	At the time the will was drawn Mr._Hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age , knowing just what changes she wanted made and_so_forth '' . 
17354	br-l15	25	70	371345	Garth hesitated . 
17355	br-l15	25	71	371348	`` Mr._Hohlbein and I have noticed some lapses since , though . 
17356	br-l15	25	72	371360	Most_of them this past year , I 'd say . 
17357	br-l15	25	73	371370	Even two or three years ago I doubt that she 'd have become involved in this unfortunate Johnston affair . 
17358	br-l15	25	74	371390	She 'd have consulted us , you see . 
17359	br-l15	25	75	371399	She always did before , and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised '' . 
17360	br-l15	26	76	371415	The inspector nodded , doubting this . 
17361	br-l15	26	77	371422	Mrs._Meeker had n't struck him as ready to seek anyone 's advise , least_of_all Garth 's . 
17362	br-l15	26	78	371439	With her sharp_tongue she 'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons . 
17363	br-l15	26	79	371451	It would have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs . 
17364	br-l15	27	80	371461	Madden settled back to read the will . 
17365	br-l15	28	81	371469	He skimmed_over the millions that went to Meeker_Park , Medfield_Hospital , the civic_center , the Public_Health_Nursing_Association , the library , and_so_on , pausing when he came to the scholarship fund . 
17366	br-l15	28	82	371500	Two millions were added to what had been set_aside for it in Mrs._Meeker 's lifetime , and the proviso made that as long as Brian_Thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board_of_trustees ( hereinafter appointed by the bank administering the estate ) he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would entail . 
17367	br-l15	29	83	371575	A splendid vote_of_confidence in Thayer , Madden reflected . 
17368	br-l15	29	84	371584	Tenure , too . 
17369	br-l15	29	85	371588	Very nice for him . 
17370	br-l15	30	86	371593	He went_on to personal bequests , a list of names largely unknown to him . 
17371	br-l15	30	87	371608	Twenty-five_thousand to each of the great-nieces in Oregon ( not much to blood_relatives out of millions ) ten_thousand to this friend and that , five_thousand to another ; to Brian_Thayer , the sum of ten_thousand dollars ; to the Pecks , ten_thousand each ; to Joan_Sheldon the conditional bequest of ten_thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was still in Mrs._Meeker 's employ at the time of the latter 's death . 
17372	br-l15	30	88	371684	( No additional five_thousand for each year after Joan 's twenty-first birthday ; Mrs._Meeker had n't got_around_to taking_care of that . ) 
17373	br-l15	31	89	371706	Too_bad , Madden thought . 
17374	br-l15	31	90	371711	Joan_Sheldon had earned the larger bequest . 
17375	br-l15	32	91	371718	Mr._Hohlbein was left twenty_thousand , Garth ten . 
17376	br-l15	32	92	371726	There were no other names Madden recognized . 
17377	br-l15	32	93	371734	Arthur_Williams 's might well have been included , he felt . 
17378	br-l15	32	94	371745	Mrs._Meeker had spent a small_fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for him in her will if he should be found after her death , and had never mentioned his name to her lawyers . 
17379	br-l15	33	95	371784	Madden took_up this point with Garth , who shrugged it off . 
17380	br-l15	33	96	371796	`` Old people have their idiosyncrasies '' . 
17381	br-l15	34	97	371804	`` This one came a_bit high at thirty_thousand or more '' . 
17382	br-l15	35	98	371816	`` Well , she had a number of them where money was concerned '' , Garth said . 
17383	br-l15	35	99	371834	`` Sometimes we 'd have trouble persuading her to make tax-exempt charitable contributions , and I 've known her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet ; the next moment she 'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty_thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate Johnston affair . 
17384	br-l15	35	100	371891	There was no telling how she 'd react to spending money '' . 
17385	br-l15	36	101	371904	Madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund . 
17386	br-l15	37	102	371915	There was an annual audit , Garth informed him . 
17387	br-l15	37	103	371925	No discrepancies or shortages had ever been found . 
17388	br-l15	37	104	371934	Brian_Thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator . 
17389	br-l15	37	105	371943	His salary had reached the ten_thousand mark . 
17390	br-l15	37	106	371951	His expenses ran another four or five_thousand . 
17391	br-l15	37	107	371959	The lawyer did n't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner_party - Thayer , like himself , Madden reflected , was the extra man so prized by hostesses - and found him easy enough to talk to . 
17392	br-l15	37	108	372002	But he did n't play golf , did n't seem to belong_to any local clubs - his work took him away a_lot , of_course - which probably accounted_for his tendency to keep_to_himself . 
17393	br-l15	38	109	372035	Garth 's glance began to flicker to his watch . 
17394	br-l15	39	110	372045	He said that he had already told the police_chief that he did n't know what insurance man had recommended Johnston to Mrs._Meeker . 
17395	br-l15	39	111	372068	He would offer no theory to account_for her murder . 
17396	br-l15	39	112	372078	The whole_thing , his manner conveyed , was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept_under_the_rug . 
17397	br-l15	40	113	372103	No_doubt Mrs._Meeker had snubbed him many_a time and he felt no grief over her passing . 
17398	br-l15	40	114	372119	Even_so , Madden 's dislike of the suave , correct lawyer deepened . 
17399	br-l15	40	115	372132	It would be all_right with him , he decided , if his investigation of the fraud , with its probable by-product of murder , led to Garth 's door . 
17400	br-l15	40	116	372162	Motive ? 
17401	br-l15	40	117	372164	Ten-thousand-dollar bequest . 
17402	br-l15	40	118	372167	At_first_glance , not much of a motive for a man of his standing ; but for all his air of affluence , who could tell what his private financial picture was ? 
17403	br-l15	41	119	372199	The inspector knew as he left that this was wishful_thinking . 
17404	br-l15	41	120	372210	Nevertheless , he made a mental note to look_into Garth 's financial background . 
17405	br-l15	42	121	372224	Brian_Thayer had a downtown address . 
17406	br-l15	42	122	372230	He lived in an apartment_house not over three or four years old , a reclaimed island of landscaped brick and glass on the fringe of the business_district . 
17407	br-l15	43	123	372258	He occupied a two bedroom apartment on the fourth floor , using the second bedroom as his office . 
17408	br-l15	43	124	372277	Airy and bright , the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture , rugs , and draperies . 
17409	br-l15	43	125	372295	Done by a professional decorator , Madden thought , and somehow as impersonal , as unremarkable as its occupant . 
17410	br-l15	43	126	372315	In Dunston the rent would run close_to two_hundred a month ; in Medfield , perhaps twenty-five less , not all_of it paid by Thayer , who could charge off one room on his expense_account . 
17411	br-l15	44	127	372350	He took Madden into the room he used as an office . 
17412	br-l15	44	128	372362	It contained a desk , files , a typewriter on a stand , and two big leather armchairs . 
17413	br-l15	44	129	372381	A newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them . 
17414	br-l15	44	130	372393	Thayer folded it up and offered a drink . 
17415	br-l15	45	131	372402	The inspector declined . 
17416	br-l15	45	132	372406	To begin the interview , he asked if Thayer , with more time to think it over , could add to what he had said the other day about Johnston . 
17417	br-l15	46	133	372437	Thayer shook his head . 
17418	br-l15	46	134	372442	`` It 's all I think_about , too . 
17419	br-l15	46	135	372451	That and her death . 
17420	br-l15	46	136	372456	It 's still unbelievable that it was murder . 
17421	br-l15	46	137	372465	For all her domineering ways , I can n't conceive_of her having had a deadly enemy '' . 
17422	br-l16	1	1	372483	`` Dammit , Phil , are you trying to wreck my career ? 
17423	br-l16	1	2	372496	Because that 's what you 're doing - wrecking it , wrecking it , wrecking it '' ! 
17424	br-l16	1	3	372514	Griffith had confronted Hoag on the building 's front steps - Hoag had been permitted no further - and backed him against a wrought-iron railing . 
17425	br-l16	1	4	372540	His rage had built_up as he made his way here from the second floor , helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed . 
17426	br-l16	2	5	372565	Hoag said , `` I did n't send_for you , Leigh . 
17427	br-l16	2	6	372577	I want the captain in_charge . 
17428	br-l16	2	7	372583	Where is he '' ? 
17429	br-l16	3	8	372588	`` Phil , for God 's sake , go_away . 
17430	br-l16	3	9	372598	The undersecretary 's in there . 
17431	br-l16	3	10	372604	I told you there 's nothing between Midge and me , nothing . 
17432	br-l16	3	11	372617	It 's all in your mind '' . 
17433	br-l16	3	12	372625	A_couple_of sobs escaped him , followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional_state . 
17434	br-l16	3	13	372639	`` Why , I 'm not fit to touch the hem of her garment '' . 
17435	br-l16	4	14	372655	`` Leigh , get_a_grip_on yourself . 
17436	br-l16	4	15	372661	It 's not about you or Midge . 
17437	br-l16	4	16	372669	I have some security information about the prime_minister '' . 
17438	br-l16	5	17	372679	Griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eyes . 
17439	br-l16	5	18	372688	`` Not about me ? 
17440	br-l16	5	19	372693	You mean it , Phil ? 
17441	br-l16	5	20	372699	You would n't pull my leg , old_man ? 
17442	br-l16	5	21	372708	I did get you on the platform this morning '' . 
17443	br-l16	6	22	372719	`` I 'm not pulling your leg . 
17444	br-l16	6	23	372727	Will you call that captain '' ? 
17445	br-l16	7	24	372734	`` No use , he won n't come '' . 
17446	br-l16	7	25	372744	He peered closely at Hoag in the gathering darkness . 
17447	br-l16	7	26	372754	`` What happened to your head '' ? 
17448	br-l16	8	27	372762	`` I was hit - knocked_out . 
17449	br-l16	8	28	372769	Now will you get him '' ? 
17450	br-l16	9	29	372776	`` He says I 'm to take the message '' . 
17451	br-l16	9	30	372787	He stared at Hoag drunkenly . 
17452	br-l16	9	31	372793	`` Who 'd hit you in the head '' ? 
17453	br-l16	10	32	372803	`` It does n't matter . 
17454	br-l16	10	33	372809	You get_back to the captain and tell him this : Somebody 's going_to take a shot at the prime_minister , and Mahzeer is in_on the plot . 
17455	br-l16	10	34	372836	Tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime_minister with Mahzeer '' . 
17456	br-l16	11	35	372849	Griffith said , `` That 's impossible . 
17457	br-l16	11	36	372857	Mahzeer 's the ambassador '' . 
17458	br-l16	12	37	372863	`` Nevertheless it 's true '' . 
17459	br-l16	13	38	372870	`` Impossible '' . 
17460	br-l16	13	39	372874	Griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it . 
17461	br-l16	13	40	372889	`` I 'll show you how wrong you are . 
17462	br-l16	13	41	372899	Mahzeer and the prime_minister are alone right now '' . 
17463	br-l16	13	42	372909	He nodded triumphantly . 
17464	br-l16	13	43	372913	`` So that proves it '' ! 
17465	br-l16	14	44	372920	Hoag looked terrified . 
17466	br-l16	14	45	372924	`` Where are they '' ? 
17467	br-l16	15	46	372930	`` Where 'd you expect , the john ? 
17468	br-l16	15	47	372939	Mahzeer 's office '' . 
17469	br-l16	16	48	372944	`` Where is that '' ? 
17470	br-l16	17	49	372950	`` Facing us , two flights up . 
17471	br-l16	17	50	372958	Look , old_man , you can n't go_up . 
17472	br-l16	17	51	372967	They won n't even let you in the front_door . 
17473	br-l16	17	52	372977	So why do n't you be a good boy and '' - 
17474	br-l16	18	53	372989	Hoag grabbed him by the shoulders . 
17475	br-l16	18	54	372996	`` Listen to me , Leigh . 
17476	br-l16	18	55	373003	If you want to spend another day in the State_Department - another day - you get_in there and tell that captain what I told you '' . 
17477	br-l16	18	56	373030	He bit_out the words . 
17478	br-l16	18	57	373035	`` And you know I can do it '' . 
17479	br-l16	19	58	373045	Griffith raised placating hands . 
17480	br-l16	19	59	373050	`` Easy_does_it , Phil . 
17481	br-l16	19	60	373055	I was just going . 
17482	br-l16	19	61	373060	I 'm on my way '' . 
17483	br-l16	19	62	373067	He turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking_back . 
17484	br-l16	19	63	373086	On the second landing he paused to look_for Docherty , did n't see him , and accepted a glass of champagne . 
17485	br-l16	19	64	373108	He took several large swallows , recollected that Docherty had gone_up another flight , and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him . 
17486	br-l16	19	65	373135	The way Hoag was , no telling what he might say or do . 
17487	br-l16	19	66	373149	He finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing . 
17488	br-l16	19	67	373161	At the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress . 
17489	br-l16	19	68	373171	`` Yes , what is it '' ? 
17490	br-l16	19	69	373179	he asked . 
17491	br-l16	20	70	373182	`` I want Captain_Docherty '' . 
17492	br-l16	20	71	373188	He spotted Docherty coming_out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him . 
17493	br-l16	21	72	373207	Docherty said , `` It 's okay , Bonfiglio , let him by '' . 
17494	br-l16	21	73	373222	They walked toward each other . 
17495	br-l16	21	74	373228	`` Well '' ? 
17496	br-l16	22	75	373232	Griffith said , `` Hoag told me to tell you '' - he waited until they were close ; it was hideously embarrassing - `` not to let the prime_minister be alone with Mahzeer '' . 
17497	br-l16	23	76	373268	Griffith looked half crocked to the captain ; it would be just like him . 
17498	br-l16	23	77	373283	`` Why not '' ? 
17499	br-l16	24	78	373288	`` He claims Mahzeer 's in a plot to kill the P.M . '' . 
17500	br-l16	25	79	373303	Docherty went taut : was it possible ? 
17501	br-l16	25	80	373311	Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime_minister feared ? 
17502	br-l16	25	81	373325	Not possible , he thought ; the prime_minister knew who his enemy was here ; he was n't going_to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter . 
17503	br-l16	25	82	373354	And if by some wild chance Mahzeer was the man , he would n't dare try anything now - not after Docherty had looked_in on the two of them to see that all was well . 
17504	br-l16	25	83	373390	Docherty was damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry_truck . 
17505	br-l16	25	84	373411	One more muddleheaded play like that one and they 'd be leading him away . 
17506	br-l16	25	85	373426	Still , this had to be checked_out . 
17507	br-l16	26	86	373434	`` Where 'd your friend Hoag get his information '' ? 
17508	br-l16	26	87	373445	he asked . 
17509	br-l16	27	88	373448	`` Have n't the faintest , Captain '' . 
17510	br-l16	28	89	373457	`` Would you mind sending him up_here ? 
17511	br-l16	28	90	373465	I 'd like to talk to him '' . 
17512	br-l16	28	91	373474	Troubled , he continued along the corridor , poking his head into the next office for a careful look around . 
17513	br-l16	29	92	373495	But Hoag had not stayed_on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building . 
17514	br-l16	29	93	373510	He was unwilling to rely_on Griffith 's carrying his message , and he had no confidence the police would act_on it . 
17515	br-l16	29	94	373532	If Mahzeer was alone with the prime_minister he could be arranging his execution while Hoag stood out here shivering in the darkening street . 
17516	br-l16	29	95	373556	He would have to do something on_his_own . 
17517	br-l16	29	96	373564	But what ? 
17518	br-l16	30	97	373567	The door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down_the_stairs . 
17519	br-l16	30	98	373585	In the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps . 
17520	br-l16	30	99	373600	These were the early departures ; in half an hour the reception would be over . 
17521	br-l16	30	100	373616	If Mahzeer was planning to set_up the prime_minister for Muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes . 
17522	br-l16	30	101	373638	Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building . 
17523	br-l16	30	102	373653	Wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories . 
17524	br-l16	30	103	373666	On the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests ; the scene looked_like a Christmas_card . 
17525	br-l16	30	104	373686	On the third floor one of the two windows was lighted ; it was framed in maroon drapes , and no faces were visible . 
17526	br-l16	30	105	373711	This would be Mahzeer 's office . 
17527	br-l16	30	106	373718	He and the prime_minister would be back from the window , seated at Mahzeer 's desk ; they would be going_over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting . 
17528	br-l16	30	107	373751	In a minute , or five minutes , the business would be done ; Mahzeer would stand_up , the prime_minister would follow . 
17529	br-l16	30	108	373774	Mahzeer would direct the prime_minister 's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and_then step to one side . 
17530	br-l16	30	109	373797	The single shot would come ; Hoag would carry its sound to his grave . 
17531	br-l16	30	110	373812	Mahzeer , of_course , would be desolate . 
17532	br-l16	30	111	373820	How was he to suspect that an assassin had been lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance ? 
17533	br-l16	31	112	373842	Hoag turned . 
17534	br-l16	31	113	373845	Where across the street ? 
17535	br-l16	31	114	373850	Where was Muller waiting with the rifle ? 
17536	br-l16	31	115	373858	Narrow four story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf . 
17537	br-l16	31	116	373876	Most_of them could be eliminated ; Muller 's would have to be one of the half_dozen almost directly opposite . 
17538	br-l16	31	117	373896	The legation was generously set back from the building line ; if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere . 
17539	br-l16	31	118	373924	Would the shot come from a roof ? 
17540	br-l16	31	119	373932	He ran his eye along the roof copings ; almost at_once a figure bulked up . 
17541	br-l16	31	120	373948	But dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman . 
17542	br-l16	31	121	373964	With a cop patrolling the road Muller would have to be inside a building - if he was here at_all , and not waiting for the prime_minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at La_Guardia_Airport . 
17543	br-l16	32	122	374002	Hoag crossed the narrow street , squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk . 
17544	br-l16	32	123	374017	From this side he could see farther into the legation 's third story window , but he saw no faces ; the room 's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police_captain . 
17545	br-l16	32	124	374058	If only the latter were true . 
17546	br-l16	32	125	374065	He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades : one was a club - that was out ; two others he ruled_out because all their windows were lighted . 
17547	br-l16	32	126	374095	That left three , possibly four , one looking much like the next . 
17548	br-l16	32	127	374109	He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule . 
17549	br-l16	32	128	374124	He quickly closed it again . 
17550	br-l16	32	129	374130	He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments , but this one , from a glance at the hall furnishings , was obviously still a functioning town_house , and its owners were in residence ; that made it doubtful as the hiding_place of a man whose plans had to be made in_advance . 
17551	br-l16	33	130	374187	He went_on to the next building and found what he expected - the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule . 
17552	br-l16	33	131	374208	On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes ; there were six apartments . 
17553	br-l16	33	132	374226	Now what ? 
17554	br-l16	33	133	374229	The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him . 
17555	br-l16	33	134	374239	This was senseless - he had no idea what to look_for . 
17556	br-l16	33	135	374251	He peered in the boxes themselves ; all were empty except one , and that one was jammed with letters and magazines . 
17557	br-l16	33	136	374274	The occupants of Apartment Number 3 were probably away for a_few days , and not likely to return on a Friday . 
17558	br-l16	33	137	374296	Had Muller made the same deduction ? 
17559	br-l16	33	138	374303	Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes . 
17560	br-l16	34	139	374312	He opened the inner door ; the cooking odors were stronger - all_over the city , at this hour , housewives would be fussing over stoves . 
17561	br-l16	34	140	374339	He climbed , as quickly as he could urge his body , up the two unbroken flights to the third floor , pulling himself along on a delicate balustrade , all that remained of the building 's beauty . 
17562	br-l16	34	141	374378	He paused on the landing to steady his breathing and_then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead . 
17563	br-l16	34	142	374403	Now he was certain : the lock had not yielded to Muller 's collection of keys ; fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open . 
17564	br-l16	34	143	374431	It had been shut again , but the lock was broken ; he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch . 
17565	br-l16	35	144	374458	What was he to do now ? 
17566	br-l16	35	145	374465	He had thought no further than finding Muller . 
17567	br-l16	35	146	374474	He realized now he had more_than half hoped he would n't find him - that Muller would not be here , that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond Hoag 's control . 
17568	br-l16	35	147	374508	He could not break_in on an armed man . 
17569	br-l16	35	148	374517	He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop . 
17570	br-l16	35	149	374532	Was there time ? 
17571	br-l16	36	150	374536	His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door . 
17572	br-l16	36	151	374555	Hoag pushed open the door : at the far end of the long dark room Muller was faintly silhouetted against the window , the rifle still raised ; he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen_table he had dragged to the sill . 
17573	br-l16	36	152	374599	He turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight , dismissing Hoag for_the_moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at Hoag 's apartment . 
17574	br-l16	37	153	374638	Hoag stretched his left_hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch : evil flourishes in the dark . 
17575	br-l16	37	154	374657	The room was bathed in light at the instant Muller 's second shot came . 
17576	br-l16	37	155	374672	Muller , nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car 's headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; his face wore a look of outrage . 
17577	br-l16	37	156	374710	A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; a following volley of shots shattered glass , ripped the ceiling , and sent him lurching heavily from the table . 
17578	br-l16	37	157	374743	He was dead before his body made contact with the floor . 
17579	br-l16	37	158	374755	Hoag stumbled back into the hall , leaned_against the wall , and started to retch . 
17580	br-l16	38	159	374771	After Captain_Docherty sent Arleigh_Griffith for Hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before Griffith returned , buoyed_up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne . 
17581	br-l17	1	1	374816	The safe at Ingleside_District_Station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to Captain_Harris 's office ( to the left ) , the lieutenant 's office ( farther along and to the left ) and the janitor 's supply_closet ( straight ahead ) . 
17582	br-l17	2	2	374864	The safe is a repository for three dead flashlight_batteries , a_hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint cards , a stack of unsold Policemen's_Ball tickets from last year , and thirty-seven cents in coins and stamps . 
17583	br-l17	2	3	374900	Gun set the captain 's fifth of Hiram_Walker inside the safe before he reported to Lt._Killpath , though he knew that Killpath 's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on Herman_Wolff 's gift . 
17584	br-l17	2	4	374936	It was more a matter of tact , and also it was none of Killpath 's goddam business . 
17585	br-l17	3	5	374955	He walked up_to the lieutenant 's office , leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles and a gas_gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine_gun that was occasionally tried_out on the Academy_Range . 
17586	br-l17	3	6	374991	He stared at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing envelopes . 
17587	br-l17	4	7	375008	`` Where 's the Lieut '' ? 
17588	br-l17	5	8	375015	The clerk wagged his head toward the captain 's office . 
17589	br-l17	5	9	375026	Gun went to the connecting door , which was open , and stood at attention while Orville_Torrence_Killpath , in full uniform , finished combing his hair . 
17590	br-l17	6	10	375053	The lieutenant 's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded , and as Killpath raked the comb through it , it stuck together in thatches so that it looked_like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull . 
17591	br-l17	6	11	375089	The lieutenant eyed Gun 's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and_then glanced back at his own face , moving the comb methodically around his head . 
17592	br-l17	7	12	375117	Leave me alone , Gun thought . 
17593	br-l17	7	13	375124	Fight with Sam_Schaeffer , fight with the whole damned Bureau . 
17594	br-l17	7	14	375135	But leave me alone . 
17595	br-l17	7	15	375140	Because I 'm looking_for the son_of_a_bitch that killed that old_man , and I 'm going_to get him . 
17596	br-l17	7	16	375158	If you just leave me to hell alone , Lieutenant . 
17597	br-l17	8	17	375169	Killpath peered through half closed lids at his reflection , thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced . 
17598	br-l17	9	18	375191	Gun waited for Killpath to sit_down behind the desk near the window . 
17599	br-l17	9	19	375204	He sat stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel , though it was obvious to Gun that Killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel_chair . 
17600	br-l17	9	20	375234	The desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room , including wooden file_cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons . 
17601	br-l17	10	21	375276	Killpath pulled one thin leg up , clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut . 
17602	br-l17	10	22	375299	It was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of Killpath defying his ulcer . 
17603	br-l17	10	23	375318	He put his chin on his kneecap , stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping_block , and stared wordlessly at his sergeant . 
17604	br-l17	11	24	375345	Gun waited . 
17605	br-l17	12	25	375348	The 7_:_45 bell rang and he could hear the outside_doors bang shut , closing in the assembled day_watch . 
17606	br-l17	13	26	375367	Finally , Orville intoned through his hawk_nose , `` We can n't have people running in any time they please , Sergeant '' . 
17607	br-l17	14	27	375391	`` No , sir '' . 
17608	br-l17	14	28	375397	`` Running in , running out . 
17609	br-l17	14	29	375404	Ca n't have it . 
17610	br-l17	14	30	375409	Makes_for confusion and congestion '' . 
17611	br-l17	14	31	375415	He rocked back in the chair , knee locked against stomach , his beady eyes fixed on Matson . 
17612	br-l17	15	32	375434	He was silent again , possibly listening to the sounds in the squadroom . 
17613	br-l17	15	33	375448	Roll was being called . 
17614	br-l17	15	34	375453	Gun cleared his throat . 
17615	br-l17	16	35	375458	Killpath said , `` You were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago , Sergeant . 
17616	br-l17	16	36	375476	That 's not getting all the juice out of the orange , now is it '' ? 
17617	br-l17	17	37	375493	`` No , sir '' . 
17618	br-l17	18	38	375499	Then Killpath smiled . 
17619	br-l17	18	39	375503	Gun knew that nothing but aces back_to_back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at_the_same_time . 
17620	br-l17	19	40	375521	The day-watch platoon commander , Lt._Rinker , was calling_out the beat assignments , but Matson could n't make the names mean anything . 
17621	br-l17	20	41	375544	`` I called the station at three this morning '' , Killpath 's nasal voice pronounced . 
17622	br-l17	20	42	375561	`` Do you have any idea who might have been in_charge at the time '' ? 
17623	br-l17	21	43	375577	`` Sergeant_Vaughn , sir '' . 
17624	br-l17	22	44	375583	`` Now , now , you 're just guessing , Sergeant '' . 
17625	br-l17	22	45	375596	He smiled thinly , savoring his joke . 
17626	br-l17	22	46	375604	`` What if I said nobody was here but a_couple_of patrolmen '' ? 
17627	br-l17	23	47	375617	`` Sir , Vaughn knows better than to leave the station without a relief . 
17628	br-l17	23	48	375632	He must have '' - 
17629	br-l17	24	49	375637	`` He let a patrolman take_over the duties of the station_keeper . 
17630	br-l17	24	50	375649	Now that 's not regulation , is it '' ? 
17631	br-l17	25	51	375659	`` No , sir '' . 
17632	br-l17	26	52	375665	`` But you did n't know a thing about it , did you '' ? 
17633	br-l17	26	53	375680	Killpath leaned forward ; his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again , frowning now . 
17634	br-l17	26	54	375700	`` That 's not taking one 's command with a responsible attitude , Matson '' . 
17635	br-l17	27	55	375716	Gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool . 
17636	br-l17	27	56	375727	But stupidity was no consolation when it had rank . 
17637	br-l17	28	57	375737	`` I was out in the district , sir '' . 
17638	br-l17	29	58	375748	`` Oh , yes . 
17639	br-l17	29	59	375753	So I have heard '' . 
17640	br-l17	29	60	375759	He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk . 
17641	br-l17	29	61	375773	`` I might point_out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not , ah , limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped '' . 
17642	br-l17	29	62	375812	He took_up a white sheet_of_paper , dark with single-spaced data . 
17643	br-l17	30	63	375823	A car pulled into the driveway outside the window . 
17644	br-l17	30	64	375833	Gun knew it was Car_12 , the wagon , returned from delivering Ingleside 's drunk-and-disorderlies to the City_Jail . 
17645	br-l17	30	65	375852	But for some fool reason he could n't remember which men he 'd put on the transfer detail . 
17646	br-l17	30	66	375871	He stared at the report in Killpath 's hand , sure it was written by Accacia - just as sure as if he 'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand . 
17647	br-l17	30	67	375902	He sucked_in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the gold wire stems of his glasses around his ears and_then , eying the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` Acting_Lieutenant_Gunnar_Matson one failed to see that the station_keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station 's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide_Detail of the Inspector's_Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying_on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting_Captain_O._T._Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known_as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six '' - he leaned_back and peeled_off his glasses `` - failed to co-operate with the Acting_Captain by returning promptly when so ordered . 
17648	br-l17	30	68	376059	What have you to say to_that , Sergeant '' ? 
17649	br-l17	30	69	376069	Killpath sailed the paper across the desk , but Matson did n't pick it up or even glance at it . 
17650	br-l17	31	70	376090	`` Well '' ? 
17651	br-l17	32	71	376094	`` I did n't think Accacia knew so many big words , Lieutenant '' . 
17652	br-l17	33	72	376109	Killpath licked his lips . 
17653	br-l17	33	73	376114	`` Patrolman_Accacia is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer . 
17654	br-l17	33	74	376124	I do n't think his diligence mitigates your negligence , Matson '' . 
17655	br-l17	34	75	376137	`` Negligence , hell '' ! 
17656	br-l17	34	76	376143	Gun held his breath a moment , pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat . 
17657	br-l17	34	77	376166	`` Sir . 
17658	br-l17	34	78	376169	I would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to_boot , if I 'd sat around this station all night when somebody got_away with murder in my district . 
17659	br-l17	34	79	376199	It 's too_bad I did n't call you , and it 's too_bad I let Schaeffer use Accacia when he could have had a boy who 'd be glad to learn something of Homicide procedure . 
17660	br-l17	34	80	376235	But I 'm not one damned bit sorry I went_out to question the people I know in the places they hang_around , and '' - 
17661	br-l17	35	81	376260	`` Let 's not push our patience beyond the danger_line , Sergeant '' , Killpath nasaled . 
17662	br-l17	35	82	376277	`` I should n't like to have to write you up for insubordination as_well as dereliction of duty '' . 
17663	br-l17	36	83	376297	Gun stiffened , his hands balling into fists at his sides . 
17664	br-l17	36	84	376309	He clamped his jaws to keep the fury from spilling_out . 
17665	br-l17	36	85	376320	An argument with Orville_Torrence_Killpath was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing_range . 
17666	br-l17	37	86	376338	Killpath leaned forward again , rocked comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee . 
17667	br-l17	37	87	376354	`` Let 's just remember , Sergeant , that we must all carry_our_own_umbrella . 
17668	br-l17	37	88	376368	A district station can n't run smoothly , unless '' - He interrupted himself , looking around Gun at the doorway . 
17669	br-l17	37	89	376390	`` Morning , Lieutenant_Rinker '' . 
17670	br-l17	38	90	376396	`` Sorry , Orville . 
17671	br-l17	38	91	376401	I thought you had n't come_in yet '' . 
17672	br-l17	39	92	376410	`` I 've been here for some time '' . 
17673	br-l17	39	93	376420	He stood_up , cocked his head and eyed Gun coldly . 
17674	br-l17	39	94	376431	`` The sergeant is just leaving '' . 
17675	br-l17	40	95	376439	It had come as no great surprise to Matson that the hot water in the showers did n't work , that Loren_Severe had thrown_up all_over the stairs , or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walked_off with his cigarettes . 
17676	br-l17	40	96	376481	It was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in Killpath 's office . 
17677	br-l17	41	97	376503	Now , as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office , he nodded and said good_night to the station_keeper and his clerks , not stopping to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing_out . 
17678	br-l17	42	98	376544	Not that he gave a damn what the grapevine sent_out about Killpath 's little speech on the comportment of platoon commanders . 
17679	br-l17	42	99	376566	He just did n't want to talk_about it . 
17680	br-l17	42	100	376575	If the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night , Killpath would just have to go_out and drag Gun back by the heels once an hour ; because he 'd be damned if he was going_to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain . 
17681	br-l17	43	101	376632	At the doorway he squinted up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes , remembering then that he 'd left them at the Doughnuttery . 
17682	br-l17	43	102	376663	He could pick_up another pack on his way home , if he were going_home . 
17683	br-l17	43	103	376678	But even before he started across the oiled road to his Plymouth , parked in the lot under the cypress_trees across from the station , he knew that he was n't going_home . 
17684	br-l17	44	104	376711	Not_yet . 
17685	br-l17	45	105	376713	It was nine o_'_clock in the morning : the hour which , like a spade turning clods of earth , exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain_dormant in the quiet night . 
17686	br-l17	45	106	376750	Mission_Street at this hour was populated by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his tour of duty - the neighborhood that had known Urbano_Quintana by day . 
17687	br-l17	46	107	376781	Sol_Phillips had purchased the Alliance_Furniture_Mart seventeen years ago . 
17688	br-l17	46	108	376790	It was professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good_will , and the name was written in gold in foot high letters across each of the two display_windows . 
17689	br-l17	47	109	376820	On the right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , was Gonzalez , Prop. , and under_that , Se_Habla_Espanol . 
17690	br-l17	47	110	376847	Mr._Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez , Prop. , but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome . 
17691	br-l17	47	111	376877	Language was no problem anyway ; Mr._Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of Mission_Street . 
17692	br-l17	48	112	376907	Aside from the fact that business was slow this time_of_year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising , Mr._Phillips had no worries at_all , and he said as much to Gun_Matson , who sat across from him in civilian clothes , on a Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed , mauve velour , $ 79.89 nothing down special ! 
17693	br-l17	49	113	376963	`` She 's honest_as_the_day '' , Mr._Phillips said , and added , `` Mr._Gunnar , I can say this to you : Beebe is a_little too honest . 
17694	br-l17	49	114	376991	You can n't tell a customer how much it 's going_to cost him to refinance his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down ! 
17695	br-l17	49	115	377020	A time_plan is a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' - He interrupted himself , smiling . 
17696	br-l17	49	116	377040	`` I put her in lamps . 
17697	br-l17	49	117	377047	That way I do n't lose so much '' . 
17698	br-l17	50	118	377057	`` Why do n't you just hire somebody else '' ? 
17699	br-l18	1	1	377068	`` She says she has to finish a story '' . 
17700	br-l18	1	2	377079	He shrugged . 
17701	br-l18	1	3	377082	`` I asked her why she could n't do it tomorrow , but it seems the muse is working good tonight and she 's afraid to let_it_go '' . 
17702	br-l18	2	4	377111	Casey made some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man . 
17703	br-l18	2	5	377127	His name was George_Needham and he , too , had come from a good family . 
17704	br-l18	2	6	377143	He was perhaps thirty-two , nicely set_up , with light_brown hair that had a pronounced wave . 
17705	br-l18	2	7	377160	He was always well groomed and well tailored , and he had that rich_man 's look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep_schools and a proper university . 
17706	br-l18	2	8	377191	An only child , he had done all the things that young_men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke . 
17707	br-l18	2	9	377222	Since then he had worked_at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling . 
17708	br-l18	3	10	377240	All this went through Casey 's mind in the first instant , but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at_all . 
17709	br-l18	3	11	377268	For he had understood that Betty had been engaged to a boy named Barry_Jenkins . 
17710	br-l18	3	12	377283	She had grown_up with young Jenkins , and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting_married at_least twice . 
17711	br-l18	3	13	377306	He wanted to ask her about Jenkins now , but he knew he could n't do so in Needham 's presence . 
17712	br-l18	3	14	377328	And so , still wondering and a_little perplexed , he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make_sure that she would know he was kidding . 
17713	br-l18	4	15	377355	`` Where did you pick him up '' ? 
17714	br-l18	5	16	377364	`` Oh , I 've known him quite a while '' . 
17715	br-l18	5	17	377376	She glanced at her companion fondly . 
17716	br-l18	5	18	377383	`` Have n't I , George '' ? 
17717	br-l18	6	19	377391	`` I 've been_after her for years '' , Needham said , `` but I 've never been able to get anywhere until the last few days '' . 
17718	br-l18	7	20	377420	The girl 's eyes were softly shining as she reached_out and touched Casey 's hand . 
17719	br-l18	7	21	377436	`` Can I tell you a secret ? 
17720	br-l18	7	22	377444	We 're going_to get_married . 
17721	br-l18	7	23	377449	Do you approve '' ? 
17722	br-l18	8	24	377454	Casey kept his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was working_on him as he thought again about Needham , who was eight or ten years older than the girl . 
17723	br-l18	8	25	377486	He wondered whether Needham was going_to swear_off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was counting_on the income from Betty 's estate to subsidize him . 
17724	br-l18	8	26	377514	None of_this showed in his face , and he tried to keep his skepticism in_hand . 
17725	br-l18	8	27	377530	He made a point of frowning , of acting_out the part of the fond father confessor . 
17726	br-l18	9	28	377547	`` I 'll have to give it some thought '' , he said . 
17727	br-l18	9	29	377561	`` You would n't want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable , would you '' ? 
17728	br-l18	10	30	377582	She made a face at him and then she laughed . 
17729	br-l18	10	31	377593	`` Of_course not '' . 
17730	br-l18	11	32	377598	`` I 'll get my references in_order '' , Needham said , and though he spoke with a smile , Casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused . 
17731	br-l18	11	33	377630	`` Stop_by any time , Casey '' . 
17732	br-l18	11	34	377638	He stood_up and touched the girl 's arm . 
17733	br-l18	11	35	377647	`` Come on , darling . 
17734	br-l18	11	36	377653	If you 're really serious about working_on that story , I 'd better take you home '' . 
17735	br-l18	12	37	377671	Casey watched them go , still frowning absently and_then dismissing the matter as he called_for his check . 
17736	br-l18	12	38	377689	As he went_out he told Freddie the dinner was perfect , and when he got his hat and coat from Nancy_Parks and put a fifty-piece_piece in the slot , he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry . 
17737	br-l18	13	39	377731	A taxi took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car , and a_few minutes later he found a parking_place across the street from his apartment . 
17738	br-l18	13	40	377763	Because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours , he did not think to look and see if Jerry_Burton 's car was still there . 
17739	br-l18	13	41	377793	In_fact , he did not think_about Jerry_Burton at_all until he entered his living_room and closed the door behind him . 
17740	br-l18	13	42	377813	Only then , when his glance focused_on the divan and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem . 
17741	br-l18	14	43	377836	Even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread_over Burton , the pillow , the sheet_of_paper on top of it . 
17742	br-l18	14	44	377864	Then he was striding across the room , his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched_up the note . 
17743	br-l18	15	45	377888	Jack : 
17744	br-l18	16	46	377890	Look in the wastebasket . 
17745	br-l18	16	47	377895	I knew the only way I could beat you was to play_possum , but it was a good try , kid , and I appreciate it . 
17746	br-l18	17	48	377922	J. . 
17747	br-l18	18	49	377924	The wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan , and the instant Casey picked it up he knew what had happened . 
17748	br-l18	18	50	377948	The discarded papers inside were sodden , there was a glint of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct . 
17749	br-l18	18	51	377975	He put the basket down distastefully , muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof . 
17750	br-l18	18	52	377998	For he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and_then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself . 
17751	br-l18	19	53	378025	For another second or two he gave_in to the annoyance that was directed at himself ; then his mind moved_on to be confronted by something far more serious , and as the thought expanded , the implications jarred him . 
17752	br-l18	19	54	378065	It no_longer mattered that Burton had outsmarted him . 
17753	br-l18	19	55	378074	The important thing was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket . 
17754	br-l18	19	56	378094	And that gun was empty . 
17755	br-l18	20	57	378100	Even before his mind had rounded_out the idea , he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled_out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver . 
17756	br-l18	20	58	378129	He considered them with brooding eyes , brows bunched as his brain grappled with the problem and tried to find some solution . 
17757	br-l18	20	59	378152	He said : `` The crazy fool '' , half aloud . 
17758	br-l18	20	60	378164	He put the shells on the table , as though he could no_longer bear to hold them . 
17759	br-l18	20	61	378182	He thought : Where the hell could he have gone ? 
17760	br-l18	20	62	378193	How can I find him ? 
17761	br-l18	21	63	378199	There was no answer to this and he began to pace back_and_forth across the room , his imagination out of control . 
17762	br-l18	21	64	378221	He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton had sobered_up enough to get some sense . 
17763	br-l18	21	65	378237	Maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer , whoever he was , in_which_case an unloaded gun would be good_enough . 
17764	br-l18	21	66	378258	He thought_of other possibilities , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way he could reach Burton . 
17765	br-l18	21	67	378287	Then , as he turned toward the telephone , it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly . 
17766	br-l18	22	68	378313	`` Yeah '' , he said . 
17767	br-l18	23	69	378320	`` Casey '' ? 
17768	br-l18	24	70	378324	`` Yeah '' . 
17769	br-l18	25	71	378328	`` Tony_Calenda '' . 
17770	br-l18	26	72	378332	Casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was , but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head . 
17771	br-l18	26	73	378363	When he heard Calenda say : `` What about that picture you took this afternoon '' ? it still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank_Ackerly . 
17772	br-l18	27	74	378397	`` What picture '' ? he demanded . 
17773	br-l18	28	75	378405	`` You took a picture of me at the corner of Washington and Blake about three_thirty this afternoon '' . 
17774	br-l18	29	76	378425	`` Who says so '' ? 
17775	br-l18	30	77	378431	`` One of my boys '' . 
17776	br-l18	31	78	378438	Casey believed that much . 
17777	br-l18	31	79	378443	Calenda was not the sort who walked_around without one of his `` boys '' close_at_hand . 
17778	br-l18	32	80	378459	`` So '' ? 
17779	br-l18	33	81	378463	`` With my trial coming_up in Federal_Court next week I would n't want that picture published '' . 
17780	br-l18	34	82	378481	`` Who says it 's going to be published '' ? 
17781	br-l18	35	83	378492	`` I would n't even want it to get_around '' . 
17782	br-l18	36	84	378503	Under normal circumstances Casey was a_little fussy when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken . 
17783	br-l18	36	85	378523	Even_so , he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly . 
17784	br-l18	36	86	378540	Right now , however , he was still too worried about Jerry_Burton , and the gun that had no bullets , and the story Burton had told him , to care too_much about Tony_Calenda . 
17785	br-l18	36	87	378575	His nerves were getting a_little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice . 
17786	br-l18	37	88	378591	`` Look '' , he said . 
17787	br-l18	37	89	378598	`` I was hired to take a picture . 
17788	br-l18	37	90	378607	I took it . 
17789	br-l18	37	91	378611	That 's all I know about it and that 's all I care '' . 
17790	br-l18	38	92	378626	`` Maybe you 'd better tell the guy who hired you what I said '' . 
17791	br-l18	39	93	378642	`` You tell him '' . 
17792	br-l18	40	94	378648	`` All_right '' , Calenda said , his voice still quiet . 
17793	br-l18	40	95	378660	`` But I meant what I said , Casey . 
17794	br-l18	40	96	378670	If that picture gets_around and I find_out you had anything to do with it , I 'm going_to send a_couple_of my boys around to see you '' . 
17795	br-l18	41	97	378698	`` You do that '' , Casey said . 
17796	br-l18	41	98	378707	`` Just be sure to send your two best boys , Tony '' . 
17797	br-l18	42	99	378721	He hung_up with a bang , annoyed at himself for running_off_at_the_mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create . 
17798	br-l18	42	100	378747	As_soon_as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone_directory and found Jerry_Burton 's home number . 
17799	br-l18	42	101	378765	He dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung_up . 
17800	br-l18	42	102	378779	He called the bar and grill where he had picked Burton up that afternoon . 
17801	br-l18	42	103	378794	When he was told that no one had seen Burton since then , he thought_of three other places that were possibilities . 
17802	br-l18	42	104	378816	Each time he got the same answer and in_the_end he gave_up . 
17803	br-l18	43	105	378828	By the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed_down . 
17804	br-l18	43	106	378840	He had done all he could and that was that . 
17805	br-l18	43	107	378851	And anyway Burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in_trouble even when he was drunk . 
17806	br-l18	43	108	378873	He , Casey , had been scared for_a_while , but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible . 
17807	br-l18	43	109	378895	He should have stayed here and watched Burton . 
17808	br-l18	43	110	378904	He did n't . 
17809	br-l18	43	111	378908	So he made a mistake . 
17810	br-l18	43	112	378914	So what ? 
17811	br-l18	44	113	378917	He kept telling himself this as he went_out to the kitchen to make a drink . 
17812	br-l18	44	114	378933	Only then did he decide he did n't want one . 
17813	br-l18	44	115	378944	He considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too . 
17814	br-l18	44	116	378957	Finally he went_into the bedroom and sat_down to take_off his shoes . 
17815	br-l18	44	117	378969	He had just finished unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again . 
17816	br-l18	44	118	378983	When he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent . 
17817	br-l18	45	119	378999	`` Casey ? 
17818	br-l18	45	120	379002	You do n't know me but I know you . 
17819	br-l18	45	121	379012	If you want a picture get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can . 
17820	br-l18	45	122	379032	If you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys '' . 
17821	br-l18	46	123	379043	Casey heard the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it took him no more than three seconds to make_his_decision . 
17822	br-l18	46	124	379070	For over the years he had received many such calls . 
17823	br-l18	46	125	379081	Some of them came from people who identified themselves . 
17824	br-l18	46	126	379091	Some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past . 
17825	br-l18	46	127	379104	Others because they expected some sort of reward for the information . 
17826	br-l18	46	128	379116	A_few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break . 
17827	br-l18	46	129	379137	Only an occasional tip turned_out to be a phony , and , like the police , Casey had made a point of running_down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time . 
17828	br-l18	47	130	379171	He was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less_than two minutes , and it took him only three more to reach the corner , a block from Columbus_Avenue . 
17829	br-l18	47	131	379204	It was a district of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements , and he could see the police_radio_car as he rounded the corner and slammed_on the brakes . 
17830	br-l18	47	132	379234	He did not bother with his radio - there would be time for that later - but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling_station and the public telephone_booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned . 
17831	br-l18	48	133	379275	The police_car had pulled_up behind a small sedan , its headlights still on . 
17832	br-n09	1	1	379289	Miraculously , she found exactly the right statement . 
17833	br-n09	1	2	379298	She began it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him . 
17834	br-n09	2	3	379315	`` I want to tell you something Thomas_DeMontez_Lord . 
17835	br-n09	2	4	379324	I 'm well aware that you 've got a pedigree as long as my leg , and that I do n't amount to anything . 
17836	br-n09	2	5	379349	But '' - 
17837	br-n09	3	6	379352	`` But it do n't matter a-tall '' , Lord supplied fondly . 
17838	br-n09	3	7	379365	`` To me you 'll always be the girl o ' my dreams , an ' the sweetest flower that grows '' . 
17839	br-n09	4	8	379388	Beaming idiotically , he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her . 
17840	br-n09	4	9	379402	She yanked away from him furiously . 
17841	br-n09	5	10	379409	`` You shut_up ! 
17842	br-n09	5	11	379413	shu-tt up-pp ! 
17843	br-n09	5	12	379416	I 've got something to say to you , and by God you 're going to listen . 
17844	br-n09	5	13	379434	Do you hear me ? 
17845	br-n09	5	14	379439	You 're going to listen '' ! 
17846	br-n09	6	15	379446	Lord nodded agreeably . 
17847	br-n09	6	16	379450	He said he wanted very_much to listen . 
17848	br-n09	6	17	379458	He knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important , as_well_as pleasin ' to the ear , and he did n't want to miss a word of_it . 
17849	br-n09	6	18	379494	So would she mind speaking a_little louder ? 
17850	br-n09	7	19	379502	`` I think you stink , Tom_Lord ! 
17851	br-n09	7	20	379510	I think you 're mean and hateful and stupid , and - louder '' ? said Joyce . 
17852	br-n09	8	21	379528	`` Uh-huh . 
17853	br-n09	8	22	379531	So I can hear you while I 'm checkin ' the car . 
17854	br-n09	8	23	379544	Looks like we might be in_for a speck of trouble '' . 
17855	br-n09	9	24	379556	He opened the door and got_out . 
17856	br-n09	9	25	379563	He waited at the car side for a moment , looking down at her expectantly . 
17857	br-n09	10	26	379579	`` Well ? 
17858	br-n09	10	27	379582	Was n't you goin ' to say somethin '' ' ? 
17859	br-n09	10	28	379593	Then , helpfully , as she merely stared at him in weary silence , `` Maybe you could write it down for me , huh ? 
17860	br-n09	10	29	379619	Print it in real big letters , an ' I can cipher it out later '' . 
17861	br-n09	11	30	379636	`` Aah , go_on '' , she said . 
17862	br-n09	11	31	379645	`` Just go the hell on '' . 
17863	br-n09	12	32	379653	He grinned , nodded , and walked_around to the front of the car . 
17864	br-n09	12	33	379667	Lips pursed mournfully , he stared down at its crazily sagging left side . 
17865	br-n09	12	34	379681	Then he hunkered_down on the heels of his handmade boots , peered into the orderly chaos of axle , shock_absorber , and spring . 
17866	br-n09	13	35	379705	He went prone on his stomach , the_better to pursue his examination . 
17867	br-n09	13	36	379718	After a time , he straightened again , brushing the red Permian dust from his hands , slapping it from his six dollar levis and his tailored , twenty-five dollar shirt . 
17868	br-n09	14	37	379750	He wore no gun - a strange ommission for a peace_officer in this country . 
17869	br-n09	14	38	379765	Never , he 'd once told Joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called_for a gun . 
17870	br-n09	14	39	379785	And he really feels that way , she thought . 
17871	br-n09	14	40	379795	That 's really all he 's got , all he is . 
17872	br-n09	14	41	379807	Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package . 
17873	br-n09	14	42	379819	If I could make myself feel the same way . 
17874	br-n09	15	43	379829	She studied him hopefully , yearningly ; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis . 
17875	br-n09	15	44	379852	Here in the God-forsaken place , the westerly end of nowhere , Tom_Lord looked almost insignificant , almost contemptible . 
17876	br-n09	16	45	379872	He was handsome , with his coal-black hair and eyes , his fine chiseled features . 
17877	br-n09	16	46	379888	But she 'd known plenty of handsomer guys , and , conceding his good_looks , what was there left ? 
17878	br-n09	16	47	379908	He was n't a big man ; rather on the medium side . 
17879	br-n09	16	48	379921	Neither was he very powerful of build . 
17880	br-n09	16	49	379929	He could move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion to do so ) , but he was more wiry than truly strong . 
17881	br-n09	16	50	379957	And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance . 
17882	br-n09	17	51	379971	Just nothing , she told herself . 
17883	br-n09	17	52	379978	Just so darned sure of himself that he puts_the_Indian_sign on everyone . 
17884	br-n09	17	53	379990	But , by gosh , I want him and I 'm going_to have him ! 
17885	br-n09	18	54	380005	He caught her eye , came_back around the car with the boot wearer 's teetering , half mincing walk . 
17886	br-n09	18	55	380025	Why did these yokels still wear boots , anyway , when most had scarcely sat a horse in years ? 
17887	br-n09	18	56	380045	He slid in at her side , tucked a cigar into his mouth , and politely proffered one to her . 
17888	br-n09	19	57	380066	`` Oh , cut_it_out , Tom '' ! she snapped . 
17889	br-n09	19	58	380077	`` Ca n't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute '' ? 
17890	br-n09	20	59	380091	`` This ai n't your brand , maybe '' , Lord suggested . 
17891	br-n09	20	60	380104	`` Or maybe you just do n't feel_like a cigar '' ? 
17892	br-n09	21	61	380116	`` I feel_like getting_back to town , that 's what I feel_like ! 
17893	br-n09	21	62	380129	Now , are you going_to take me or am I supposed_to walk '' ? 
17894	br-n09	22	63	380143	`` Might get there faster walkin '' ' , Lord drawled , `` seein ' as how I got a busted front spring . 
17895	br-n09	22	64	380167	On_the_other_hand , howsomever , maybe you would n't either . 
17896	br-n09	22	65	380177	I figger it 's probl_'_y a sixty-five mile walk , and I c_'_n maybe get this spring patched_up in a_couple_of hours '' . 
17897	br-n09	23	66	380200	`` How - with what ? 
17898	br-n09	23	67	380206	There 's nothing out here but rattlesnakes '' . 
17899	br-n09	24	68	380215	`` Now , ai n't it the truth '' ? 
17900	br-n09	24	69	380225	Lord laughed with secret amusement . 
17901	br-n09	24	70	380231	`` Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes , so I reckon I 'll get the boss rattler to help me '' . 
17902	br-n09	25	71	380253	`` Tom ! 
17903	br-n09	25	72	380256	For_God 's sake '' ! 
17904	br-n09	26	73	380261	`` Looky '' . 
17905	br-n09	26	74	380265	He pointed , cutting her off . 
17906	br-n09	26	75	380272	`` See that wildcat '' ? 
17907	br-n09	27	76	380278	She saw it then , the distant derrick of the wildcat - a test well in unexplored country . 
17908	br-n09	27	77	380297	And even with her limited knowledge of such things , she knew that the car could be repaired there ; sufficiently , at_least , to get them back into town . 
17909	br-n09	27	78	380328	A wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency . 
17910	br-n09	27	79	380339	He had_to depend_on himself , since he was invariably miles and hours away from others . 
17911	br-n09	28	80	380355	`` Well , let 's get_going '' , she said impatiently . 
17912	br-n09	28	81	380367	`` I '' - She broke_off , frowning . 
17913	br-n09	28	82	380376	`` What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag ? 
17914	br-n09	28	83	380386	Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you '' ? 
17915	br-n09	29	84	380395	`` Why , I meant what I said '' , Lord declared . 
17916	br-n09	29	85	380408	`` What else would I mean , anyways '' ? 
17917	br-n09	30	86	380418	She looked at him , lips compressed . 
17918	br-n09	30	87	380426	Then , with a shrug of pretended indifference , she took a compact from her purse and went_through_the_motions of fixing her make-up . 
17919	br-n09	30	88	380449	In his mood , it was the best way to handle him ; that_is , to show no curiosity whatsoever . 
17920	br-n09	30	89	380470	Otherwise , she would be baited into a tantrum - teased and provoked until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom_Lord Vs. Joyce_Lakewood . 
17921	br-n09	31	90	380505	The car lurched along at a snail 's crawl , the left front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself . 
17922	br-n09	31	91	380533	Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering_wheel . 
17923	br-n09	31	92	380542	He seemed very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was working_out exactly as he had planned . 
17924	br-n09	31	93	380562	Along with this self-satisfaction , however , Joyce sensed a growing tension . 
17925	br-n09	31	94	380575	It poured out of him like an electric_current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine drawn body were coiling for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated . 
17926	br-n09	32	95	380612	Joyce had seen him like this once before - more_than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion . 
17927	br-n09	32	96	380633	That was the day that he had practically mopped_up the main_street of Big_Sands with Aaron_McBride , field boss for the Highlands_Oil_+_Gas_Company . 
17928	br-n09	33	97	380655	Tom had been laying for Aaron_McBride for a long_time , just waiting to catch him out of line . 
17929	br-n09	33	98	380674	McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed_up in town with a pistol on his hip . 
17930	br-n09	33	99	380691	He had a legitimate reason for wearing it . 
17931	br-n09	33	100	380700	It was payday for Highlands , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil_fields . 
17932	br-n09	33	101	380719	Moreover , as_long_as the weapon was carried openly , the sheriff 's office had made no previous issue of_it . 
17933	br-n09	34	102	380739	`` So what 's this all about '' ? he demanded , when Lord confronted him . 
17934	br-n09	34	103	380756	I 'm not the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit `` . 
17935	br-n09	35	104	380777	It was the wrong thing to say . 
17936	br-n09	35	105	380785	By failing to do as he was told instantly - to take_out a permit or return the gun to his car - he had played into Lord 's hands . 
17937	br-n09	36	106	380815	The trouble was that he had virtually had_to protest . 
17938	br-n09	36	107	380825	The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him . 
17939	br-n09	37	108	380838	So , `` How about it '' ? he said . 
17940	br-n09	37	109	380849	`` Why single me out on this permit deal '' ? 
17941	br-n09	38	110	380860	`` Well , I 'll tell you about that '' , Lord told him . 
17942	br-n09	38	111	380875	`` We aim t ' be see-lective , y_'_know ? 
17943	br-n09	38	112	380885	Do n't like to bother no_one unless we have to , which I figger we do , in your case . 
17944	br-n09	38	113	380906	Figger we got_to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big_shots '' . 
17945	br-n09	39	114	380920	McBride reddened . 
17946	br-n09	39	115	380923	He himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company , but that had nothing to do with him . 
17947	br-n09	39	116	380945	He was an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable . 
17948	br-n09	40	117	380966	`` Look , Lord '' , he said hoarsely . 
17949	br-n09	40	118	380976	`` I know you 've_got a grudge against me , and maybe I can n't blame you . 
17950	br-n09	40	119	380994	You think that Highlands swindled you and I helped ' em do it . 
17951	br-n09	40	120	381008	But you 're all wrong , man ! 
17952	br-n09	40	121	381016	I 'm no lawyer . 
17953	br-n09	40	122	381021	I just do what I 'm told , and '' - 
17954	br-n09	41	123	381032	`` Uh-huh . 
17955	br-n09	41	124	381035	An ' that could mean trouble with a fella that 's workin ' for crooks . 
17956	br-n09	41	125	381051	So you get_rid_of that pistol right now , Mis-ter_McBride . 
17957	br-n09	41	126	381061	You do that or take you out a permit right now '' . 
17958	br-n09	42	127	381074	McBride could n't do either , of_course . 
17959	br-n09	42	128	381082	Not immediately , as the deputy demanded . 
17960	br-n09	42	129	381090	Not without a face-saving respite of at_least a_few minutes . 
17961	br-n09	42	130	381100	To do so would make his job well-nigh impossible . 
17962	br-n09	42	131	381110	Oil-field workers were a rough tough lot . 
17963	br-n09	42	132	381118	How could he exert authority over them - make them toe_the_line , as he had to - if he knuckled_under to this small-town clown ? 
17964	br-n09	43	133	381143	`` I 'll get_around_to it a_little later '' , he mumbled desperately . 
17965	br-n09	43	134	381156	`` Just as_soon_as I go to the bank , and '' - 
17966	br-n09	44	135	381168	`` Huh-uh . 
17967	br-n09	44	136	381171	Now , Mis-ter_McBride '' , said Lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss 's arm . 
17968	br-n09	45	137	381193	It was strictly the deputy 's game , but McBride had gone too far to throw_in . 
17969	br-n09	45	138	381210	Now , he could only play the last card in what was probably the world 's coldest deck . 
17970	br-n09	46	139	381229	He flung off Lord 's hand and attempted to push past him , inadvertently shoving him into a storefront . 
17971	br-n09	47	140	381249	It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition . 
17972	br-n09	48	141	381263	Lord slugged him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine . 
17973	br-n09	48	142	381281	Then , as he doubled , gasping , vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten , Lord straightened him with an uppercut . 
17974	br-n09	48	143	381305	A rabbit_punch redoubled him . 
17975	br-n09	48	144	381310	And_then there was a numbing blow to the heart , and another gut flattening blow to the stomach . 
17976	br-n09	49	145	381329	But he could n't keep_up with them . 
17977	br-n09	49	146	381337	No_more could he defend himself against them . 
17978	br-n09	49	147	381345	He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen . 
17979	br-n09	49	148	381357	And he could no_longer think_of face-saving , of honor , but only of escape . 
17980	br-n09	50	149	381372	Why , he 's going to kill me , he thought wildly . 
17981	br-n09	50	150	381385	I meant him no harm . 
17982	br-n09	50	151	381391	I 've given willful hurt to no man . 
17983	br-n09	50	152	381400	I was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he 's going to kill me . 
17984	br-n09	50	153	381421	Beat me to death in_front_of a_hundred people . 
17985	br-n09	51	154	381429	Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished . 
17986	br-n09	51	155	381459	He , McBride , would be cited as in the wrong , and he , Lord , would go scot-free , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too energetically . 
17987	br-n09	52	156	381494	McBride staggered into the street , flopped sprawling in the stinging dust . 
17988	br-n09	52	157	381507	Fear maddened , fleeing the lengthening shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again . 
17989	br-n09	52	158	381524	He could n't see ; he was long past the point of coherent thinking . 
17990	br-n09	52	159	381539	Dimly , he heard laughter , hoots of derision , but he could not read the racket properly . 
17991	br-n09	52	160	381558	He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago , and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air . 
17992	br-n09	53	161	381585	He hated them too_much to understand - the people of_this isolated law unto itself world that was Lord 's world . 
17993	br-n09	53	162	381606	This , he was sure , was the way they would act ; laughing_at a dying man , laughing as a man was beaten to death . 
17994	br-n09	53	163	381633	And nothing would be done about it . 
17995	br-n09	53	164	381641	Nothing unless & & & . 
17996	br-n09	54	165	381647	Donna ! 
17997	br-n09	54	166	381649	Donna , his young wife , the girl who was both daughter and wife to him . 
17998	br-n09	54	167	381666	Donna was like he was . 
17999	br-n09	54	168	381672	She lived by the rules , never compromising , never blinded or diverted by circumstance . 
18000	br-n09	54	169	381688	And Donna would - 
18001	br-n09	55	170	381692	When he regained consciousness he was in Lord 's house , in the office of Doctor_Lord , the deputy 's deceased father . 
18002	br-n10	1	1	381715	The Brannon outfit - known as the Slash-B because of its brand - reached Hondo_Creek before sundown . 
18003	br-n10	1	2	381733	The herd was watered and_then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night 's bedground . 
18004	br-n10	1	3	381754	Two of the new hands , a Mexican named Jose_Amado and a kid known only as Laredo , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd . 
18005	br-n10	2	4	381783	The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda . 
18006	br-n10	2	5	381798	They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie 's fire , rolled and lighted brown paper cigarettes , lounged_about . 
18007	br-n10	2	6	381823	There was some idle_talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day 's drive . 
18008	br-n10	2	7	381843	But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : 
18009	br-n10	2	8	381856	the failure of the boss 's wife and son to join the outfit . 
18010	br-n10	2	9	381870	It especially bothered the older hands . 
18011	br-n10	3	10	381877	The cook , Mateo_Garcia , had arrived there long before the herd . 
18012	br-n10	3	11	381890	He 'd started a fire and put coffee on , and now was busy at the work_board of his chuck_wagon . 
18013	br-n10	3	12	381911	He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch_oven . 
18014	br-n10	3	13	381923	Supper would be ready within the hour . 
18015	br-n10	4	14	381931	The Maguire family was setting_up a separate camp nearby . 
18016	br-n10	4	15	381941	Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom_Brannon 's and his father 's wagon . 
18017	br-n10	4	16	381956	Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now . 
18018	br-n10	4	17	381973	Conchita kept_an_eye_on the twins and little Elena , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing . 
18019	br-n10	4	18	381997	Conchita nagged at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom_Brannon . 
18020	br-n10	5	19	382014	Tom_Brannon had caught_up_with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it , which had been at midday . 
18021	br-n10	5	20	382032	He 'd come alone , without his wife and child . 
18022	br-n10	5	21	382043	He 'd been in an angry mood : Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him . 
18023	br-n10	6	22	382064	She wondered what had taken_place in town , between him and his wife . 
18024	br-n10	6	23	382078	She wished that she could talk to her mother about it . 
18025	br-n10	6	24	382090	Not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it . 
18026	br-n10	6	25	382106	But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern . 
18027	br-n10	7	26	382127	`` Pat , get_out of that creek ! 
18028	br-n10	7	27	382135	You too , Sean ! 
18029	br-n10	7	28	382140	Elena , you 'll get mud all_over your dress '' ! 
18030	br-n10	8	29	382151	Even as she called to the children , Conchita let her gaze seek Tom_Brannon . 
18031	br-n10	8	30	382166	Tomas , she called him - as the Mexican hands did . 
18032	br-n10	8	31	382178	He was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero , Luis_Hernandez . 
18033	br-n10	8	32	382193	Whatever they are talking_about ? 
18034	br-n10	8	33	382198	Conchita wondered . 
18035	br-n10	9	34	382201	It bothered her that she probably would never know . 
18036	br-n10	9	35	382211	Certainly , she would n't dare ask her father afterward . 
18037	br-n10	9	36	382222	He would tell her not to pry into grownups ' affairs - as though she were a little kid like Elena ! 
18038	br-n10	10	37	382244	At the moment , the three men were not saying much of anything . 
18039	br-n10	10	38	382258	They were sitting on their heels , rider fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon . 
18040	br-n10	10	39	382276	Brannon was hunkered_down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two facing him . 
18041	br-n10	10	40	382296	He held a cigarette in his right_hand . 
18042	br-n10	10	41	382304	It was burning away , forgotten . 
18043	br-n10	10	42	382311	His face was clouded with unhappiness . 
18044	br-n10	11	43	382318	He 'd told Hank_Maguire and Luis_Hernandez about his wife 's refusal to come_with him and about what he now intended to do . 
18045	br-n10	11	44	382341	They were considering it gravely , neither seeming to like what he planned . 
18046	br-n10	12	45	382355	Finally Hernandez said , `` I could offer you advice , Tomas , but you would n't heed it '' . 
18047	br-n10	13	46	382376	`` Let 's hear it , anyway '' . 
18048	br-n10	14	47	382385	`` Wait a little while . 
18049	br-n10	14	48	382391	Let Senora_Brannon live in her father 's house for a time . 
18050	br-n10	14	49	382403	Give her time to miss you . 
18051	br-n10	14	50	382410	Maybe she will then come to you . 
18052	br-n10	14	51	382418	After_all , you want the senora as_much_as you want the boy . 
18053	br-n10	14	52	382430	You need her even more_than you need him '' . 
18054	br-n10	15	53	382440	`` She won n't change her mind '' , Brannon said . 
18055	br-n10	15	54	382452	`` John_Clayton will see to that '' . 
18056	br-n10	16	55	382460	`` But after a time away from you & & & '' . 
18057	br-n10	17	56	382473	`` A year , Luis ? 
18058	br-n10	17	57	382479	Five ? 
18059	br-n10	17	58	382481	Ten ? 
18060	br-n10	17	59	382483	How long should I wait '' ? 
18061	br-n10	17	60	382490	`` Maybe in a year , Tomas & & & '' . 
18062	br-n10	18	61	382502	`` In a year she 'll like living in Clayton 's house too_much to come_back to me '' , Brannon said flatly . 
18063	br-n10	18	62	382525	`` And the boy will be too_much under his influence by then . 
18064	br-n10	18	63	382538	I 've got_to take Danny away from Clayton before I lose him altogether . 
18065	br-n10	18	64	382552	Hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten me - his own father '' ! 
18066	br-n10	19	65	382574	`` But to take him and leave his mother behind is not good '' . 
18067	br-n10	20	66	382589	`` In my place , you 'd follow such advice as you give me '' ? 
18068	br-n10	21	67	382605	Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain . 
18069	br-n10	21	68	382610	`` That I can n't answer , for I can n't imagine something like this happening to me . 
18070	br-n10	21	69	382629	Maybe I should withdraw my advice - no '' ? 
18071	br-n10	22	70	382639	Brannon looked at Hank_Maguire . 
18072	br-n10	22	71	382644	`` And you ? 
18073	br-n10	22	72	382648	What would you do in my place '' ? 
18074	br-n10	23	73	382657	Hank shook his head . 
18075	br-n10	23	74	382662	`` I do n't know , Tom . 
18076	br-n10	23	75	382670	Like Luis , I can n't see something like this happening to me . 
18077	br-n10	23	76	382684	With Maria and me , there 's never any problem . 
18078	br-n10	23	77	382695	Where I go , she goes - and the kids with us . 
18079	br-n10	23	78	382708	You 're going_to need your woman . 
18080	br-n10	23	79	382715	And the boy will need his mother . 
18081	br-n10	23	80	382723	If you take the one , you 'd_better take both '' . 
18082	br-n10	24	81	382735	Brannon shook his head . 
18083	br-n10	24	82	382740	`` I won n't force Beth to come against her will . 
18084	br-n10	24	83	382752	But I 'm going_to have my son '' . 
18085	br-n10	25	84	382761	They were silent for a little while , each looking glum . 
18086	br-n10	26	85	382773	Finally Luis_Hernandez said , `` What_must_be_,_must_be . 
18087	br-n10	26	86	382780	I am with you , of_course , Tomas '' . 
18088	br-n10	27	87	382790	And Hank_Maguire added , `` So am I , Tom '' . 
18089	br-n10	28	88	382802	`` All_right '' , Brannon said , rising . 
18090	br-n10	28	89	382811	`` We 'll ride out as_soon_as we 've had chuck '' . 
18091	br-n10	29	90	382823	Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall . 
18092	br-n10	29	91	382836	They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm . 
18093	br-n10	29	92	382847	During much of the fifteen mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east . 
18094	br-n10	29	93	382869	Later , they 'd heard the rumble of thunder and_then , just outside Rockfork , they ran_into rain . 
18095	br-n10	29	94	382888	Those who had slickers donned them . 
18096	br-n10	29	95	382895	The others put_on old coats or ducking jackets , whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles . 
18097	br-n10	30	96	382912	There were seven of them , enough for a show of strength - to run a bluff . 
18098	br-n10	30	97	382930	It was to be nothing more_than that . 
18099	br-n10	30	98	382938	There was to be no gunplay . 
18100	br-n10	30	99	382945	If the bluff failed and they ran_into trouble , Brannon had told the others , they would withdraw - and he would come after his son another time . 
18101	br-n10	30	100	382974	He did n't want to put himself outside the law . 
18102	br-n10	31	101	382985	With him were Hank_Maguire , Luis_Hernandez , and Luis 's son Pedro . 
18103	br-n10	31	102	382998	The Ramirez brothers were also along . 
18104	br-n10	31	103	383005	The seventh man was Red_Hogan , a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell_raising . 
18105	br-n10	31	104	383025	They were all good men . 
18106	br-n10	32	105	383031	It was dark early , because of the storm . 
18107	br-n10	32	106	383041	Also because of the storm , the streets of Rockfork were deserted . 
18108	br-n10	32	107	383054	Lighted windows glowed jewel bright through the downpour . 
18109	br-n10	32	108	383063	They reined_in before the town marshal 's office , a box sized building on Main_Street . 
18110	br-n10	32	109	383079	A lamp burned inside , but Brannon , peering through the window , saw that the office was empty . 
18111	br-n10	32	110	383099	He 'd hoped to catch Jesse_Macklin there . 
18112	br-n10	33	111	383107	`` Probably just stepped_out '' , he said . 
18113	br-n10	33	112	383116	`` Maybe to have supper . 
18114	br-n10	33	113	383122	Red , come along . 
18115	br-n10	33	114	383127	The rest of you wait here '' . 
18116	br-n10	34	115	383135	With Red_Hogan , he rode to the Welcome_Cafe . 
18117	br-n10	34	116	383144	Hogan got_down from the saddle and had_a_look inside . 
18118	br-n10	34	117	383153	`` Not there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse . 
18119	br-n10	34	118	383167	`` Maybe he 's at the hotel '' . 
18120	br-n10	35	119	383176	They rode to the Rockfork_House , a_little farther along the opposite side of the street . 
18121	br-n10	35	120	383192	They reined_in there , Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look_for Jesse_Macklin in the hotel dining_room . 
18122	br-n10	35	121	383212	Brannon had no slicker . 
18123	br-n10	35	122	383217	He 'd put_on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked . 
18124	br-n10	35	123	383231	But he felt no physical discomfort . 
18125	br-n10	35	124	383238	He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain . 
18126	br-n10	35	125	383248	He hardly noticed the blue green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder . 
18127	br-n10	36	126	383264	Hogan reappeared , stopped on the hotel porch , lifted a hand in signal . 
18128	br-n10	36	127	383279	Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps . 
18129	br-n10	37	128	383286	`` He 's finished eating '' , Hogan said . 
18130	br-n10	37	129	383296	`` Sitting with a cup of coffee now . 
18131	br-n10	37	130	383305	It should n't be long '' . 
18132	br-n10	38	131	383312	It seemed long , at_least to Tom_Brannon . 
18133	br-n10	38	132	383320	He and Hogan waited by the door , one to either side . 
18134	br-n10	38	133	383333	Macklin was the third man to come_out , and he came unhurriedly . 
18135	br-n10	38	134	383346	He was puffing on a cigar , and he was turning_up his coat collar against the rain . 
18136	br-n10	38	135	383364	It was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them , and_then it was too late . 
18137	br-n10	38	136	383386	They closed_in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun . 
18138	br-n10	39	137	383401	`` Just come along '' , Brannon told him . 
18139	br-n10	39	138	383411	`` Do n't start anything you can n't finish '' . 
18140	br-n10	40	139	383422	`` Now , listen '' - Macklin began . 
18141	br-n10	41	140	383431	`` We 'll talk over at your office '' . 
18142	br-n10	42	141	383441	`` Brannon , I warn you '' ! 
18143	br-n10	42	142	383449	`` Let 's go , Marsh_al '' , Brannon said , and took him by the arm . 
18144	br-n10	43	143	383467	Hogan gripped the lawman 's other arm . 
18145	br-n10	43	144	383475	They escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office . 
18146	br-n10	43	145	383490	The other five Slash-B men followed them inside , crowding the small room . 
18147	br-n10	43	146	383504	His face was stiff with anger when they let_go_of his arms . 
18148	br-n10	43	147	383516	He looked at each of them in_turn , Brannon last of all . 
18149	br-n10	44	148	383529	`` I 'll remember you '' , he said . 
18150	br-n10	44	149	383539	`` Every_last one of you . 
18151	br-n10	44	150	383545	As for you , Brannon '' - 
18152	br-n10	45	151	383552	`` Put your gun on the desk , Marshal '' . 
18153	br-n10	46	152	383563	`` Now , hold_on , damn_it ; I won n't '' - 
18154	br-n10	47	153	383575	Red_Hogan 's patience ran_out . 
18155	br-n10	47	154	383580	He lifted the skirt of Macklin 's coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk . 
18156	br-n10	47	155	383602	`` Too_much fooling_around '' , he said . 
18157	br-n10	47	156	383610	`` Do n't press_your_luck , badge toter '' . 
18158	br-n10	48	157	383619	Brannon said , `` Now the key to the lockup , Marshal '' . 
18159	br-n10	49	158	383633	`` Key '' ? 
18160	br-n10	49	159	383637	Macklin said . 
18161	br-n10	49	160	383640	`` What for '' ? 
18162	br-n10	50	161	383645	`` Ca n't you guess '' ? 
18163	br-n10	50	162	383652	Brannon said . 
18164	br-n10	50	163	383655	`` We 're putting you where you won n't come to harm . 
18165	br-n10	50	164	383668	Come_on - the key . 
18166	br-n10	50	165	383673	Get it out '' ! 
18167	br-n10	51	166	383678	`` Damned if I will . 
18168	br-n10	51	167	383684	Brannon , you 've assaulted a law_officer and '' - 
18169	br-n10	52	168	383694	They moved_in_on him , crowded him from all sides . 
18170	br-n10	52	169	383704	No man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there . 
18171	br-n10	52	170	383720	His face took_on a sudden pallor , became beaded with sweat , and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing . 
18172	br-n10	52	171	383742	He held_out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure . 
18173	br-n10	53	172	383756	He swore , and said , `` All_right . 
18174	br-n10	53	173	383765	It 's here in my pocket '' . 
18175	br-n10	54	174	383773	`` Get it out '' , Brannon ordered . 
18176	br-n10	54	175	383782	Then , as Macklin obeyed : `` Now let 's go out back '' . 
18177	br-n10	55	176	383797	Resignedly , Macklin turned to the back door . 
18178	br-n10	55	177	383806	They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear . 
18179	br-n10	55	178	383825	The door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron . 
18180	br-n10	55	179	383840	It was secured by an oversized padlock . 
18181	br-n10	55	180	383848	Macklin balked again , not wanting to unlock and open the door . 
18182	br-n10	55	181	383861	They crowded him in that threatening way once_more , forced him to give_in . 
18183	br-n10	55	182	383875	Once the door was open , they crowded him inside the dark building . 
18184	br-n10	55	183	383889	He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door . 
18185	br-n10	56	184	383907	They returned to the street , mounted their horses , rode through the rain to the big house on Houston_Street . 
18186	br-n10	56	185	383928	Its windows glowed with lamplight . 
18187	br-n10	56	186	383934	Deputy_Marshal_Luke_Harper still stood_guard on the veranda , a forlorn , scarecrowish figure in the murky dark . 
18188	br-n10	56	187	383951	He came to the edge of the veranda , peered down at them with his hand on his gun . 
18189	br-n10	57	188	383971	`` Do n't try it '' , Brannon told him , dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following . 
18190	br-n10	57	189	383993	`` Do n't get yourself killed for something that does n't concern you '' . 
18191	br-n10	58	190	384008	He strode past the now frightened man , entered the house . 
18192	br-n10	58	191	384020	Miguel and Arturo_Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering . 
18193	br-n10	58	192	384033	The others followed Brannon inside . 
18194	br-n10	58	193	384039	They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly garbed and tough looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house . 
18195	br-n10	58	194	384068	They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of campfire smoke , of horses and cattle . 
18196	br-n10	58	195	384097	They tracked mud on the oaken floor , on the carpet . 
18197	br-n10	58	196	384109	Their presence fouled the elegance of that room . 
18198	br-n10	59	197	384118	And their arrival caught John_Clayton and Charles_Ansley off_guard . 
18199	br-n11	1	1	384127	The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing . 
18200	br-n11	1	2	384138	For men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second . 
18201	br-n11	1	3	384155	But the day of the deadline came and passed , and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction . 
18202	br-n11	1	4	384178	For , with a single exception , nothing had happened to them . 
18203	br-n11	2	5	384191	The exception was an Iron_Mountain settler named William_Lewis . 
18204	br-n11	2	6	384200	After walking out to his corral that morning , he 'd been amazed to see the dust puff_up in_front of his feet . 
18205	br-n11	2	7	384223	A split_second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sounded . 
18206	br-n11	2	8	384236	He 'd mounted_up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he 'd estimated the shot had come . 
18207	br-n11	2	9	384259	But he had found all_of the thickets and points of cover deserted . 
18208	br-n11	2	10	384272	There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near . 
18209	br-n11	3	11	384293	Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing . 
18210	br-n11	3	12	384307	He had n't even pretended to be farming his spread . 
18211	br-n11	3	13	384318	His land had never been plowed . 
18212	br-n11	3	14	384325	He had done his rustling openly and boasted about it . 
18213	br-n11	3	15	384336	He had received both first and second anonymous notices , and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them . 
18214	br-n11	3	16	384358	He had cursed at them and threatened them . 
18215	br-n11	3	17	384367	He was a man , those neighbors testified later , who did n't have a friend in the world . 
18216	br-n11	4	18	384387	William_Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once_more he accused and threatened everyone . 
18217	br-n11	5	19	384418	`` I 'll be ready next time '' ! he raged . 
18218	br-n11	5	20	384430	`` I 'll be shootin ' right back '' . 
18219	br-n11	6	21	384440	He had his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happened again . 
18220	br-n11	6	22	384457	This time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot , then spent most_of the day searching out the area . 
18221	br-n11	6	23	384491	He found nothing , but he still refused to give_up and move out . 
18222	br-n11	7	24	384505	`` Just let me meet_up_with that damned bushwhackin ' coward face-to-face '' ! he exploded . 
18223	br-n11	7	25	384521	`` That 's all I ask '' ! 
18224	br-n11	8	26	384529	He never got that chance . 
18225	br-n11	8	27	384535	For the unseen , ghostlike rifleman aimed a_little higher the third time . 
18226	br-n11	8	28	384548	A .30-30 bullet smashed directly into the center of William_Lewis ' chest . 
18227	br-n11	8	29	384561	He slumped against a log fence_rail , then tried to lift himself . 
18228	br-n11	8	30	384574	Two more shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground . 
18229	br-n11	9	31	384591	An inquest was held , and after a good_deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards . 
18230	br-n11	9	32	384624	Rumors of the offer Tom_Horn had made at the Stockgrowers'_Association meeting had leaked_out by then , and as a grand_jury investigation of the murder got underway , the prosecuting_attorney , a Colonel_Baird , ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning . 
18231	br-n11	10	33	384668	It took some time to locate Horn . 
18232	br-n11	10	34	384676	He was finally found in the Bates_Hole region of Natrona_County , two counties away . 
18233	br-n11	10	35	384691	Prosecutor_Baird immediately assumed he was hiding_out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment . 
18234	br-n11	10	36	384707	But that indictment was never made . 
18235	br-n11	10	37	384714	For Tom_Horn , it turned_out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight_faces that he had been in Bates_Hole the day of the killing . 
18236	br-n11	11	38	384747	The former scout 's alibi could n't be shaken . 
18237	br-n11	11	39	384757	The authorities had to release him . 
18238	br-n11	11	40	384764	He immediately rode on to Cheyenne , threw a ten day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends . 
18239	br-n11	12	41	384786	`` Dead center at three hundred yards , that coroner said '' ! he 'd grin . 
18240	br-n11	12	42	384803	`` Three shots in_that fella ' fore he hit the ground ! 
18241	br-n11	12	43	384815	You reckon there 's two men in_this state can shoot like that '' ? 
18242	br-n11	13	44	384829	Publicly , he denied everything . 
18243	br-n11	13	45	384835	Privately , he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin . 
18244	br-n11	13	46	384850	For a blood chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he 'd promised to do . 
18245	br-n11	14	47	384878	Tom_Horn was soon back at_work , giving his secret employers their money 's worth . 
18246	br-n11	14	48	384893	A good many beef hungry settlers were accepting the death of William_Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats . 
18247	br-n11	14	49	384916	The company herds were being raided less often , and cabins and soddies all_over the range were standing deserted . 
18248	br-n11	14	50	384936	But there were other homesteaders who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing , the work of one of his neighbors . 
18249	br-n11	14	51	384961	The rustling problem was by_no_means solved . 
18250	br-n11	15	52	384968	Even in the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still disappearing . 
18251	br-n11	15	53	384985	For less_than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on - a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred_Powell . 
18252	br-n11	16	54	385022	`` Fred was mighty crude about the way he took_in cattle '' his own hired_man , Andy_Ross , mentioned later . 
18253	br-n11	16	55	385043	`` Everyone knew it , but he sort_of acted like he did n't care who knew it - even after them notes came , even after he 'd heard about Lewis , even after he 'd been shot at a couple o ' times hisself '' ! 
18254	br-n11	17	56	385090	On the morning of September 10 , 1895 , Powell and Ross rose at dawn and began their day 's work . 
18255	br-n11	17	57	385112	Haying_time was close at_hand , and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack . 
18256	br-n11	17	58	385129	Harnessing a team to a buckboard , they drove out to a willow lined creek about a half-mile off , then climbed_down and began chopping . 
18257	br-n11	18	59	385155	Andy_Ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded . 
18258	br-n11	18	60	385175	He looked_around in surprise , then noticed that Fred_Powell was clutching his chest . 
18259	br-n11	18	61	385189	The hired_man ran over to help his boss . 
18260	br-n11	19	62	385198	`` My God , I 'm shot '' ! 
18261	br-n11	19	63	385207	Powell gasped . 
18262	br-n11	19	64	385210	And he collapsed and died instantly . 
18263	br-n11	20	65	385217	Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin . 
18264	br-n11	20	66	385227	He heaved the dead man onto the buckboard , yelled and lashed at the team and got_out of there fast . 
18265	br-n11	20	67	385248	But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing . 
18266	br-n11	21	68	385273	A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman 's hiding_place . 
18267	br-n11	21	69	385296	There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots . 
18268	br-n11	21	70	385306	Not even an empty cartridge case could be found . 
18269	br-n11	22	71	385316	Once_again , Tom_Horn was the first and most likely suspect , and he was brought_in for questioning immediately . 
18270	br-n11	22	72	385335	Once_again , he shook his head , kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready . 
18271	br-n11	22	73	385360	Later , riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne , he laid_claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made . 
18272	br-n11	23	74	385389	`` Exterminatin ' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he 'd blandly announce . 
18273	br-n11	23	75	385408	`` And I sort_o ' got a corner on the market '' . 
18274	br-n11	24	76	385421	`` Tom '' , a friend asked him once , `` how_come you bushwhacked them rustlers ? 
18275	br-n11	24	77	385438	They would n't o ' stood no chance with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down '' . 
18276	br-n11	25	78	385456	He had lots of friends , then as always . 
18277	br-n11	25	79	385466	Even as he became widely known_as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend . 
18278	br-n11	25	80	385491	No man 's name brought more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo . 
18279	br-n11	26	81	385506	`` Well '' , he explained , `` s'posin you was a nester swingin ' the long rope ? 
18280	br-n11	26	82	385525	Which would you be most scairt of - a dry-gulchin ' or a shoot-down '' ? 
18281	br-n11	27	83	385541	`` Yeah , I can see that '' , the friend was forced to agree . 
18282	br-n11	27	84	385557	`` But , well , it just do n't seem sportin ' somehow '' ! 
18283	br-n11	28	85	385572	`` Sportin '' ' ! 
18284	br-n11	28	86	385577	The tall sunburnt rustler hunter stared in amazement . 
18285	br-n11	28	87	385586	`` Sportin '' ' ! he echoed again in soft wonder . 
18286	br-n11	28	88	385598	`` I seen a lot o ' things in my time . 
18287	br-n11	28	89	385610	I found a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant_hill , and another time we ran_across some teamsters they 'd caught , tied upside_down on their own wagon_wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o ' their skulls . 
18288	br-n11	28	90	385655	I heard o ' Texas cattlemen wrappin ' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin ' the sun shrink ' em and squeeze him to death . 
18289	br-n11	28	91	385684	But there 's one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just do n't think there is , and that 's a sportin ' way o ' killin ' a man '' ! 
18290	br-n11	29	92	385721	After the first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored . 
18291	br-n11	29	93	385734	The lesson had been learned . 
18292	br-n11	29	94	385740	The examples were plain . 
18293	br-n11	29	95	385745	When Fred_Powell 's brother-in-law , Charlie_Keane , moved_into the dead man 's home , the anonymous letter_writer took no chances on Charlie taking_up where Fred had left_off and wasted no time on a first notice : 
18294	br-n11	30	96	385781	If you do n't leave this country within 3 days , your life will be taken the same as Powell 's was . 
18295	br-n11	31	97	385804	This was the message found tacked to the cabin door . 
18296	br-n11	31	98	385815	Keane left , within three days . 
18297	br-n11	32	99	385822	All through Albany and Laramie counties , other men were doing the same . 
18298	br-n11	32	100	385836	Houses of settlers who 'd treated the company herds as a natural_resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards . 
18299	br-n11	32	101	385866	The small half-heartedly tended fields of men who 'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow . 
18300	br-n11	32	102	385886	No cow thief could count_on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any_longer . 
18301	br-n11	32	103	385902	Jury , judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated . 
18302	br-n11	33	104	385946	For three straight years , Tom_Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures , and how_many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known . 
18303	br-n11	33	105	385980	It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at_all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state . 
18304	br-n11	33	106	386011	It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him . 
18305	br-n11	34	107	386036	For that legend was growing explosively , Rumor was insisting he received a price of $ 600 a man . 
18306	br-n11	34	108	386056	( The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $ 125 , very good money in an era when top hands worked for $ 30 and found . ) 
18307	br-n11	34	109	386089	Rumor had_it he slipped two small rocks under each victim 's head as a sort of trademark . 
18308	br-n11	34	110	386107	( A detailed search of old coroner 's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest . ) 
18309	br-n11	35	111	386125	One thing was certain - his method was effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary . 
18310	br-n11	35	112	386149	The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field_glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the Upper_Laramie country in a single week . 
18311	br-n11	36	113	386184	`` My reputation 's my stock in trade '' , Tom mentioned more_than once . 
18312	br-n11	36	114	386199	He evidently could n't foresee that it might be his downfall in_the_end . 
18313	br-n11	37	115	386212	He had made himself the personification of the_Devil to the homesteaders . 
18314	br-n11	37	116	386224	But to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a_few years earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure . 
18315	br-n11	37	117	386261	Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown . 
18316	br-n11	37	118	386292	He made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped_out in their roundups . 
18317	br-n11	38	119	386306	In the cow camps , Tom_Horn was regarded_as a hero , as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos . 
18318	br-n11	38	120	386335	The hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range , waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way_of_life . 
18319	br-n11	38	121	386366	The wailing , guitar strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made_up songs about him . 
18320	br-n11	39	122	386381	By 1898 , rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming . 
18321	br-n12	1	1	386399	When several minutes had passed and Curt had n't emerged from the livery_stable , Brenner re-entered the hotel and faced Summers across the counter . 
18322	br-n12	2	2	386424	`` I have a little job for you , Charlie . 
18323	br-n12	2	3	386435	I 'm sure you won n't mind doing me a small favor '' . 
18324	br-n12	3	4	386449	Brenner 's voice was oily , but Summers was n't fooled . 
18325	br-n12	3	5	386461	He moistened his lips uneasily . 
18326	br-n12	4	6	386467	`` What is it you want me to do , Mr._Brenner '' ? 
18327	br-n12	5	7	386480	Brenner shrugged carelessly . 
18328	br-n12	6	8	386484	`` It 's very simple . 
18329	br-n12	6	9	386490	I just want you to take a message to Diane_Molinari . 
18330	br-n12	6	10	386501	Tell her to come here to the hotel '' . 
18331	br-n12	7	11	386511	Vastly relieved , Summers nodded and started toward the door . 
18332	br-n12	8	12	386522	`` One thing , Summers '' , Brenner said . 
18333	br-n12	8	13	386532	`` You 're not to mention my name . 
18334	br-n12	8	14	386541	Tell her Curt_Adams wants to see her '' . 
18335	br-n12	9	15	386550	Summers pulled_up short , and turned_around . 
18336	br-n12	10	16	386557	`` I do n't know , Mr._Brenner '' , he said haltingly , beginning to get an inkling of Brenner 's plans . 
18337	br-n12	10	17	386580	`` It does n't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that . 
18338	br-n12	10	18	386595	Could n't I just '' - His voice trailed off into silence . 
18339	br-n12	11	19	386608	Brenner continued to smile , but his eyes were cold . 
18340	br-n12	11	20	386619	He turned and looked_around at the lobby as though seeing things he had n't before noticed . 
18341	br-n12	12	21	386636	`` You know , Summers '' , he said thoughtfully . 
18342	br-n12	12	22	386647	`` Eagle 's Nest ought to have a fire_company . 
18343	br-n12	12	23	386657	If someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go_up like a haystack '' . 
18344	br-n12	12	24	386676	He started toward the stairway , then turned to add , `` Tell her to come to Adams 's room , that Adams is in_trouble . 
18345	br-n12	12	25	386702	Tell her to hurry '' . 
18346	br-n12	13	26	386708	`` Yes sir '' . 
18347	br-n12	13	27	386713	His face pale , Summers headed for the street . 
18348	br-n12	14	28	386723	Curt 's visit to the livery_stable had been merely a precaution in_case anyone should be watching . 
18349	br-n12	14	29	386740	He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess 's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all_right , then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside . 
18350	br-n12	15	30	386775	The fact that Jess 's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Diane 's information had been wrong , but Curt did n't interpret it this way . 
18351	br-n12	15	31	386807	A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in_case it was needed . 
18352	br-n12	15	32	386825	Probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding . 
18353	br-n12	16	33	386837	From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black 's house without using the street . 
18354	br-n12	16	34	386858	Curt approached the place cautiously , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees . 
18355	br-n12	17	35	386878	There was a light in Black 's front_room , but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior . 
18356	br-n12	17	36	386897	Curt circled the house and located a barn out back . 
18357	br-n12	17	37	386908	He could hear horses moving around inside , and nothing else . 
18358	br-n12	17	38	386920	There was no lock on the door , only an iron hook which he unfastened . 
18359	br-n12	17	39	386936	He opened the door and went_in , pulling it shut behind him . 
18360	br-n12	18	40	386949	Again he stood in the darkness listening , but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor . 
18361	br-n12	18	41	386972	He moved ahead carefully , his left_hand in_front of him , and came to a wooden partition . 
18362	br-n12	18	42	386990	Horse smell was very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws . 
18363	br-n12	18	43	387010	He found a match in his pocket and lit it . 
18364	br-n12	19	44	387021	There were two horses in the barn , a sway-backed dun and Jess_Crouch 's buckskin . 
18365	br-n12	19	45	387037	Curt snuffed_out the match . 
18366	br-n12	20	46	387042	It was certain now that Jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was Stacey_Black . 
18367	br-n12	20	47	387061	Curt wanted to get Jess alone , without interference from anyone , even as spineless a person as the store owner . 
18368	br-n12	21	48	387083	He studied the problem for a_few seconds and thought_of a means by which it might be solved . 
18369	br-n12	21	49	387101	Reaching across the side of the stall , he slapped the buckskin on the rump . 
18370	br-n12	21	50	387117	The startled animal let_out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall . 
18371	br-n12	22	51	387131	As Curt had hoped , the house door banged open . 
18372	br-n12	22	52	387142	He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall . 
18373	br-n12	23	53	387161	Curt moved_over beside the door and waited . 
18374	br-n12	23	54	387169	Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard , and Jess 's smothered curses . 
18375	br-n12	23	55	387183	The door swung open , and Jess said sourly , `` What the hell 's the_matter with you ? '' 
18376	br-n12	23	56	387203	The horse continued to snort . 
18377	br-n12	23	57	387209	Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner 's voice . 
18378	br-n12	24	58	387227	Jess cursed again , and entered the barn . 
18379	br-n12	24	59	387236	A match flared , and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop . 
18380	br-n12	24	60	387257	As he crossed to_the side of the stall , Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer . 
18381	br-n12	25	61	387276	`` Before you try anything '' , he said . 
18382	br-n12	25	62	387286	`` Remember what happened to Gruller '' . 
18383	br-n12	26	63	387294	Jess caught his breath in surprise . 
18384	br-n12	26	64	387301	He started to reach for his gun , but apparently hammer it . 
18385	br-n12	27	65	387314	`` That 's the stuff '' , Curt said . 
18386	br-n12	27	66	387324	`` Just hold it that way '' . 
18387	br-n12	27	67	387332	He reached_out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt . 
18388	br-n12	27	68	387347	`` You and I have a little talking to do , Jess . 
18389	br-n12	27	69	387360	You won n't be needing this '' . 
18390	br-n12	27	70	387368	He moved up and lifted Jess 's pistol out of its holster . 
18391	br-n12	28	71	387381	`` Damn you , Adams '' - Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock . 
18392	br-n12	28	72	387398	`` We ai n't got nothing to talk_about . 
18393	br-n12	28	73	387407	If I do n't come_back in the house , Breed 's going_to '' - 
18394	br-n12	29	74	387421	`` Your trigger-happy brother is n't in the house . 
18395	br-n12	29	75	387431	About now he 's probably having supper . 
18396	br-n12	29	76	387439	That long ride the four of you took must 've given him a good appetite . 
18397	br-n12	29	77	387455	Now turn_around so I can see your face '' . 
18398	br-n12	30	78	387465	Jess turned . 
18399	br-n12	30	79	387468	There was raw fury in his eyes , and the veins of his neck were swollen . 
18400	br-n12	31	80	387485	`` You 're about as dumb as they come , Adams . 
18401	br-n12	31	81	387497	I do n't know what you 're up_to , but when Brenner '' - 
18402	br-n12	32	82	387511	`` You can forget about Brenner , too '' , Curt said . 
18403	br-n12	32	83	387524	`` It 's Ben_Arbuckle we 're going_to talk_about '' . 
18404	br-n12	33	84	387534	`` Arbuckle '' ? 
18405	br-n12	33	85	387538	Jess stiffened . 
18406	br-n12	33	86	387541	`` I do n't know nothin ' about him '' . 
18407	br-n12	34	87	387552	`` No ? 
18408	br-n12	34	88	387555	I suppose you do n't know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either ; one with blood all_over it , Arbuckle 's blood '' . 
18409	br-n12	34	89	387581	Curt 's fingers put a_little more pressure on the trigger of his gun . 
18410	br-n12	34	90	387595	`` So help me , Crouch , I 'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before I do , I 'm going_to hear you admit killing him . 
18411	br-n12	34	91	387627	Now start talking . 
18412	br-n12	34	92	387631	Who told you to do it ? 
18413	br-n12	34	93	387638	Was it Dutch_Brenner '' ? 
18414	br-n12	35	94	387643	Curt was holding Jess 's gun in his left_hand . 
18415	br-n12	35	95	387653	He drew_back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess 's face , but did n't finish the motion . 
18416	br-n12	35	96	387673	Pistol whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess , but Curt could n't bring_himself to do it . 
18417	br-n12	36	97	387695	Apparently sensing this , and realizing that it gave him an advantage , Jess became bold . 
18418	br-n12	37	98	387712	`` Having all the guns makes you a big man , do n't it , Adams ? 
18419	br-n12	37	99	387729	If we was both armed , you would n't talk so tough '' . 
18420	br-n12	38	100	387743	`` No '' ? 
18421	br-n12	38	101	387747	Curt reached_out and dropped Jess 's pistol back into the holster . 
18422	br-n12	38	102	387759	He retreated a step and holstered his own . 
18423	br-n12	39	103	387768	`` All_right , Crouch ; we 're on even terms . 
18424	br-n12	39	104	387779	Now draw '' ! 
18425	br-n12	40	105	387783	Sweat bubbled out on Jess 's swarthy face . 
18426	br-n12	40	106	387792	The fingers of his right_hand twisted into a claw , but he did n't reach for the gun . 
18427	br-n12	41	107	387811	Curt , angry enough to be a_little reckless , raised his hands shoulder high . 
18428	br-n12	42	108	387826	`` Does this make it any easier , coward '' ? 
18429	br-n12	43	109	387837	`` I ai n't drawin ' against you '' , Jess said thickly . 
18430	br-n12	43	110	387851	`` I heard how you outdrew Chico . 
18431	br-n12	43	111	387859	I ai n't a gunslinger '' . 
18432	br-n12	44	112	387866	`` No . 
18433	br-n12	44	113	387869	You 're the kind of bastard who sneaks_up on a man from behind and hits him with a club . 
18434	br-n12	44	114	387889	I just wanted to hear you say so '' . 
18435	br-n12	45	115	387899	Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides . 
18436	br-n12	45	116	387914	He had found Curt 's weakness , or what to Jess was a weakness , and was smart enough to take_advantage of it . 
18437	br-n12	46	117	387938	Somewhere in the distance , a woman screamed . 
18438	br-n12	46	118	387947	Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention . 
18439	br-n12	46	119	387960	He had to make Jess talk , and he had to do it before Stacey_Black got curious and came to investigate . 
18440	br-n12	46	120	387982	Once_more he lifted Jess 's gun from its holster , only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin . 
18441	br-n12	46	121	388006	He dropped his own beside it . 
18442	br-n12	47	122	388013	`` We 'll do it another way , then '' , he said harshly . 
18443	br-n12	48	123	388028	Jess 's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt 's fist . 
18444	br-n12	48	124	388048	With a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack . 
18445	br-n12	49	125	388060	Curt managed to duck beneath the man 's flailing fist , and drove home a solid left to Jess 's mid_section . 
18446	br-n12	49	126	388082	It was like hitting a sack of salt . 
18447	br-n12	49	127	388091	Pain shout up Curt 's arm clear to the shoulder , but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit . 
18448	br-n12	49	128	388113	He slammed into the wall , bounced back , and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning . 
18449	br-n12	49	129	388134	An inch lower and it would have knocked him out . 
18450	br-n12	49	130	388145	As it was , his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move . 
18451	br-n12	49	131	388162	When his eyes began to focus , he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork . 
18452	br-n12	50	132	388179	Curt twisted to one side , and the tines of the fork bit into the floor . 
18453	br-n12	50	133	388196	Jess wasted a_few seconds trying to yank them loose . 
18454	br-n12	50	134	388206	It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet . 
18455	br-n12	51	135	388216	The tines broke_off under Jess 's twisting , and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt 's brains out . 
18456	br-n12	51	136	388239	His aim was hurried ; so the pitchfork whistled over Curt 's head . 
18457	br-n12	52	137	388253	By now Curt was seeing clearly again . 
18458	br-n12	52	138	388261	He stepped inside Jess 's guard and landed two blows to the big man 's belly , putting everything he had behind them . 
18459	br-n12	52	139	388285	They made Jess double_over . 
18460	br-n12	52	140	388290	When his head came_down , Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall . 
18461	br-n12	53	141	388310	The building shook , setting the lantern to swaying , and the buckskin to pitching again . 
18462	br-n12	53	142	388327	Even Black 's old crowbait began to snort , and from the house Black yelled , `` Jess ! 
18463	br-n12	53	143	388346	What 's going_on out there '' ? 
18464	br-n12	54	144	388353	Jess did n't seem too sure himself . 
18465	br-n12	54	145	388361	He lurched drunkenly to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall . 
18466	br-n12	54	146	388381	Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor . 
18467	br-n12	55	147	388397	Jess had had enough . 
18468	br-n12	55	148	388402	Blood gushed from his nose , and he backed_off as rapidly as he could , stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get_away from Curt 's fists . 
18469	br-n12	56	149	388433	Curt was in almost as bad shape , but he would n't quit . 
18470	br-n12	56	150	388447	He backed Jess into a corner , grabbed a handful of the man 's shirtfront , and drew_back his right fist . 
18471	br-n12	57	151	388469	`` Tell me about Arbuckle ! 
18472	br-n12	57	152	388475	You killed him , did n't you '' ? 
18473	br-n12	58	153	388484	`` It was Brenner 's idea '' , Jess mumbled , dabbing at his nose . 
18474	br-n12	58	154	388500	`` He found_out about you and Arbuckle talking . 
18475	br-n12	58	155	388509	He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble '' . 
18476	br-n12	59	156	388526	`` You mean anyone who stood_up for his rights '' , Curt said . 
18477	br-n12	59	157	388540	He let_go_of the shirt , and Jess slumped to the floor . 
18478	br-n12	59	158	388552	Turning his back , Curt crossed to the stall , reached over to untie the buckskin 's halter rope , and waved his hand in the animal 's face . 
18479	br-n12	60	159	388582	The buckskin bolted_out of the stall . 
18480	br-n12	60	160	388589	Curt moved_in and picked_up his gun . 
18481	br-n12	60	161	388596	He shook loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster . 
18482	br-n12	60	162	388613	Leaving Jess 's where it lay , he left the stall . 
18483	br-n12	61	163	388625	`` Get_up , Crouch . 
18484	br-n12	61	164	388630	We 're going someplace '' . 
18485	br-n12	62	165	388636	Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door . 
18486	br-n12	63	166	388648	`` Who 's in there '' ? 
18487	br-n12	63	167	388655	Black called fearfully . 
18488	br-n12	64	168	388659	Curt opened the door , grabbed Black by the shoulder , and pulled him into the barn . 
18489	br-n12	65	169	388677	`` You 're staying right here for_a_while . 
18490	br-n12	65	170	388685	This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle . 
18491	br-n12	65	171	388693	I 'm going_to let him tell it to somebody else '' . 
18492	br-n12	65	172	388705	He shoved Black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at Jess . 
18493	br-n12	66	173	388719	`` Get_out of here . 
18494	br-n12	66	174	388724	You 're coming along peacefully , or I 'll put a bullet in your leg '' . 
18495	br-n12	67	175	388741	Jess stumbled through the door . 
18496	br-n12	67	176	388747	Curt followed , reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it . 
18497	br-n12	67	177	388761	Black would have little trouble getting_out , but it might delay him a_few minutes . 
18498	br-n12	68	178	388776	`` Where 're you takin ' me '' ? 
18499	br-n12	68	179	388785	Jess asked worriedly . 
18500	br-n12	69	180	388789	`` We 're going to Marshal_Woods 's house . 
18501	br-n12	69	181	388798	Maybe if the marshal hears this himself , it 'll make a difference . 
18502	br-n12	69	182	388812	Somebody in this town must still have some backbone '' . 
18503	br-n14	1	1	388823	While no larger than Dutch_Springs , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous . 
18504	br-n14	1	2	388844	Men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about . 
18505	br-n14	1	3	388857	Although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch , this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them . 
18506	br-n14	2	4	388886	`` Gyp 'll be holdin_'_forth in some bar if he 's here at_all '' , Cobb declared , glancing along the street as they stretched their legs . 
18507	br-n14	3	5	388914	There were no less than six or seven saloons in Ganado , not counting the lower_class dives , all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters . 
18508	br-n14	3	6	388943	Pat only nodded . 
18509	br-n14	3	7	388947	`` Take one side of the street , and I 'll take the other '' , he proposed . 
18510	br-n14	3	8	388966	`` If you spot Carmer give a yell before you move_in '' . 
18511	br-n14	4	9	388979	Cobb 's assent was tight . 
18512	br-n14	4	10	388985	`` You do the same . 
18513	br-n14	4	11	388991	It 's all I ask , Stevens '' . 
18514	br-n14	5	12	389000	Separating , they took different sides of the main_drag and systematically combed the bars . 
18515	br-n14	5	13	389015	Russ visited two places without result and his blood_pressure was down to zero . 
18516	br-n14	5	14	389029	Suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp_Carmer so casually , even were he to prove the thief . 
18517	br-n14	5	15	389053	He tramped out of the Miners_Rest with his hopes plummeting , and headed doggedly for the Palace_Saloon , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street . 
18518	br-n14	6	16	389084	The Palace was an elaborate establishment , built practically on stilts in_front , with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch . 
18519	br-n14	6	17	389109	Behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird 's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside . 
18520	br-n14	6	18	389130	Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch . 
18521	br-n14	6	19	389141	The front windows of the place were long and narrow , reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior . 
18522	br-n14	6	20	389167	Heading for the batwings , Cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window , and suddenly dodged aside . 
18523	br-n14	6	21	389185	Nerves tight as a bowstring , he paused to gather his wits . 
18524	br-n14	7	22	389198	Against all expectation , Carmer was inside , clearly enjoying himself to_the_hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him . 
18525	br-n14	7	23	389229	Fierce anger surged through Russ . 
18526	br-n14	7	24	389235	He fought_down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on_the_spot . 
18527	br-n14	8	25	389249	Reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he feverishly scanned the busy street below . 
18528	br-n14	8	26	389268	Stevens was nowhere in_sight . 
18529	br-n14	8	27	389273	Muffling an exclamation , Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran_down . 
18530	br-n14	8	28	389286	As luck had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared . 
18531	br-n14	9	29	389304	`` What luck , Cobb '' ? he said swiftly . 
18532	br-n14	10	30	389315	Russ pointed upward . 
18533	br-n14	10	31	389319	`` He 's there '' , he got_out tersely , curbing his rising excitement . 
18534	br-n14	10	32	389334	Hitching his cartridge_belt around , Pat glanced upward briefly at the Palace and started that way with Cobb at his side . 
18535	br-n14	11	33	389356	Climbing the steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door . 
18536	br-n14	11	34	389371	Pat pushed_through first . 
18537	br-n14	11	35	389375	Forced behind him momentarily , Russ followed at_once and halted two steps inside . 
18538	br-n14	11	36	389389	His eyes widened . 
18539	br-n14	11	37	389393	While five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry , with Gyp_Carmer a prominent figure , it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday . 
18540	br-n14	11	38	389426	Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen . 
18541	br-n14	12	39	389434	A man knocked the roulette_ball about idly in its track , and another dozed at one of the card_tables . 
18542	br-n14	12	40	389454	Two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar , while the sleek headed bartender absently polished a glass . 
18543	br-n14	12	41	389478	Looking the setup over , Stevens started coolly for the rear of the place . 
18544	br-n14	13	42	389493	`` Where yuh goin '' ' ? 
18545	br-n14	14	43	389500	It was the barkeep . 
18546	br-n14	14	44	389505	Halting , Pat turned to survey him deliberately . 
18547	br-n14	14	45	389514	He did not reply , going_on toward the back . 
18548	br-n14	14	46	389524	Less assured than the tall , wide shouldered man in_the_lead , Cobb followed alertly , a hand on his gun butt . 
18549	br-n14	14	47	389546	The bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it . 
18550	br-n14	14	48	389563	He said no more . 
18551	br-n14	15	49	389568	A hall opened in back of the bar , running toward an ell . 
18552	br-n14	15	50	389582	Pat moved_into it . 
18553	br-n14	15	51	389586	Small rooms , probably for cards , opened off on either side . 
18554	br-n14	15	52	389599	All the doors were open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder . 
18555	br-n14	16	53	389627	The door was locked . 
18556	br-n14	16	54	389632	A single kick made it spring open , shuddering . 
18557	br-n14	16	55	389642	Pat saw Gyp_Carmer staggering forward , a half filled bottle upraised as if to strike . 
18558	br-n14	16	56	389658	Russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside . 
18559	br-n14	16	57	389667	With a bellow Carmer lunged at him . 
18560	br-n14	16	58	389675	But he was more_than half drunk , and his faculties were dulled . 
18561	br-n14	16	59	389688	Cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan . 
18562	br-n14	16	60	389707	He started to struggle up , heaving desperately . 
18563	br-n14	16	61	389716	Russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach . 
18564	br-n14	16	62	389731	Kneeling , Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him pinned . 
18565	br-n14	17	63	389749	`` Okay , Stevens . 
18566	br-n14	17	64	389754	I 've drawn his fangs '' , he snapped . 
18567	br-n14	17	65	389764	`` Go through his pockets , will you ? 
18568	br-n14	17	66	389773	If we have to we 'll take him apart and see what he 's made of '' ! 
18569	br-n14	18	67	389791	Complying methodically , Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside_out without finding a thing . 
18570	br-n14	18	68	389805	Cobb watched this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope waning by the moment . 
18571	br-n14	18	69	389820	Stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when Russ abruptly rose and lunged toward Carmer 's hat , which had tumbled half-a-dozen feet away when he first fell . 
18572	br-n14	18	70	389850	Cobb got it . 
18573	br-n14	18	71	389854	Straightening_up , his eyes ablaze , he held_out the battered Stetson . 
18574	br-n14	19	72	389866	`` Look at this '' ! 
18575	br-n14	20	73	389872	Inside the crown , stuffed behind the stained sweatband , could be seen thin , crumpled wads of currency . 
18576	br-n14	20	74	389892	Carmer 's ingenious cache for his loot had been found . 
18577	br-n14	21	75	389903	`` By golly , Stevens ! 
18578	br-n14	21	76	389909	You were right '' , Russ exclaimed , tearing the loose bills out of Carmer 's hat . 
18579	br-n14	21	77	389927	`` That_is , if we can be sure this is Colcord 's money '' - 
18580	br-n14	22	78	389942	Pat grunted . 
18581	br-n14	22	79	389945	`` Where else would he get it ? 
18582	br-n14	22	80	389953	Count what you 've got there , Cobb . 
18583	br-n14	22	81	389962	We can soon tell '' . 
18584	br-n14	23	82	389968	Russ ran_through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come_by honestly . 
18585	br-n14	23	83	389986	Pat nodded . 
18586	br-n14	23	84	389989	`` It 's within a_hundred of what Crip had '' , he declared . 
18587	br-n14	23	85	390003	`` We know Penny spent some - and Carmer must have dropped a_few dollars getting that load on '' . 
18588	br-n14	24	86	390023	Handing the money over , Russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean . 
18589	br-n14	24	87	390043	His glance at Gyp_Carmer was disdainful . 
18590	br-n14	24	88	390050	`` Shall we get_out of here '' ? 
18591	br-n14	25	89	390058	Leaving the card_room , they moved_back through the Palace the way they had come . 
18592	br-n14	25	90	390073	Glowering looks met them in the bar , but there was no attempt to halt them . 
18593	br-n14	25	91	390090	Pausing in the outside_door to glance behind him , Pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped_out . 
18594	br-n14	25	92	390107	He and Cobb clattered down the high steps to the street . 
18595	br-n14	26	93	390119	Neither spoke till they reached their horses . 
18596	br-n14	26	94	390127	Pat paused there , looking_across at the young fellow . 
18597	br-n14	26	95	390137	It 'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to Colcord and tell him about it , Russ `` . 
18598	br-n14	26	96	390159	He started to return it . 
18599	br-n14	27	97	390165	To his faint surprise Russ held_up his hand . 
18600	br-n14	27	98	390174	`` Not me '' , he ruled decidedly . 
18601	br-n14	27	99	390183	I 've had enough . 
18602	br-n14	27	100	390188	It was you that tracked it down anyway , Stevens `` , he pursued strictly . 
18603	br-n14	27	101	390204	'' I 'll shove_along home `` . 
18604	br-n14	28	102	390211	`` Whatever you say '' . 
18605	br-n14	28	103	390217	Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered . 
18606	br-n14	28	104	390232	`` You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly . 
18607	br-n14	29	105	390258	`` Old_Crip was n't '' , retorted Cobb tartly . 
18608	br-n14	29	106	390268	`` He 'll know when you tell him . 
18609	br-n14	29	107	390277	But I want this to sink_in awhile . 
18610	br-n14	29	108	390285	Then maybe next time he won n't be so quick on the trigger '' . 
18611	br-n14	30	109	390300	`` Pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs . 
18612	br-n14	30	110	390312	'' You 're the doctor `` , he returned with a smile . 
18613	br-n14	30	111	390325	'' But I still think Penny 's an awful nice girl , Russ `` - 
18614	br-n14	31	112	390340	`` You do n't have to tell me '' , flashed Cobb . 
18615	br-n14	31	113	390353	Giving the other a dark look , he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street . 
18616	br-n14	31	114	390372	Pat let him go , following more leisurely . 
18617	br-n14	31	115	390381	At the first restaurant he sensibly pulled_up to go_in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for Antler . 
18618	br-n14	32	116	390421	The truth was , the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck . 
18619	br-n14	32	117	390438	`` Penny 's always glad to see me over there '' , he mused bleakly . 
18620	br-n14	32	118	390454	Yet had he not visited the girl at Saw_Buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle . 
18621	br-n14	33	119	390474	Over and above that , however , was his growing suspicion of Chuck_Stober 's part in recent events . 
18622	br-n14	33	120	390493	`` Gyp_Carmer could n't have known about Colcord 's money unless he was told - and who else would have told him '' ? he asked himself . 
18623	br-n14	33	121	390521	`` It 's the second time War_Ax hands made a play for that money . 
18624	br-n14	34	122	390536	How much of an accident could that be `` ? 
18625	br-n14	35	123	390546	Nearing home , he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun . 
18626	br-n14	35	124	390561	In town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; but on the range gunfire had a meaning . 
18627	br-n14	35	125	390582	Hauling_up , Russ listened carefully . 
18628	br-n14	35	126	390588	Two minutes later it came again - a double explosion , followed by a third , sounding more distant . 
18629	br-n14	36	127	390608	As_near_as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the Antler ranch_house . 
18630	br-n14	36	128	390623	He tightened_up in a twinkling . 
18631	br-n14	36	129	390629	So_far_as he knew , only his father could be there . 
18632	br-n14	36	130	390640	What did it mean ? 
18633	br-n14	36	131	390645	Clapping spurs to the bronc he set_off at a sharp canter , with growing alarm . 
18634	br-n14	37	132	390661	His first glimpse of the ranch_house across the brushy swells told him nothing . 
18635	br-n14	37	133	390675	Still a quarter-mile away , the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed . 
18636	br-n14	37	134	390692	Setting a course straight for the house , he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face . 
18637	br-n14	38	135	390716	When it was followed by a second , whining even closer , Cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression . 
18638	br-n14	38	136	390736	He knew now what he was up against . 
18639	br-n14	38	137	390745	Whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the Antler house and , having spotted his approach , was determined to drive him off before he could get_into the fight . 
18640	br-n14	39	138	390779	Cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot , Russ drew his Colt and examined it briefly . 
18641	br-n14	39	139	390806	If he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested , he had his answer a moment later . 
18642	br-n14	40	140	390828	`` Over this way ! 
18643	br-n14	40	141	390833	He ai n't gone far '' ! a harsh cry floated to him across the brush . 
18644	br-n14	41	142	390850	A carbine cracked more loudly , and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side . 
18645	br-n14	41	143	390869	The would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close . 
18646	br-n14	41	144	390879	Dismounting , Russ looked about hastily . 
18647	br-n14	41	145	390886	Toward the west this depression led toward a draw . 
18648	br-n14	41	146	390896	Leading his pony , he hurried that way , not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range . 
18649	br-n14	42	147	390919	Swinging up then , and bending forward over the horn , he urged his mount down the meandering draw . 
18650	br-n14	42	148	390939	He had not covered a_hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind . 
18651	br-n14	42	149	390953	He had been sighted , and his attacker pumping shot after shot . 
18652	br-n14	42	150	390966	A shot or two went wild before Cobb felt something tug at his foot . 
18653	br-n14	42	151	390981	A slug had torn half of his stirrup guard away . 
18654	br-n14	42	152	390992	A second twitched his shirtsleeve , and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm . 
18655	br-n14	42	153	391009	Another snarled close overhead . 
18656	br-n14	43	154	391014	`` Jumping_Jerusalem ! 
18657	br-n14	43	155	391017	Let 's get_out of here '' ! 
18658	br-n14	44	156	391024	At the first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw . 
18659	br-n14	44	157	391044	The long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless . 
18660	br-n14	44	158	391055	Sweeping a look around , he saw that he was safe for_the_moment . 
18661	br-n14	44	159	391068	He heard cries from behind him , but he could make_out no words . 
18662	br-n14	45	160	391082	He dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw , and made_it . 
18663	br-n14	45	161	391097	Recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw , he plunged forward with undiminished speed . 
18664	br-n14	45	162	391114	Gradually the wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range . 
18665	br-n14	45	163	391126	Yet he must chance it . 
18666	br-n14	45	164	391132	He clambered out of the dwindling wash , the loose dirt flying behind him , and flashed a look about . 
18667	br-n15	1	1	391153	Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry_out the assigned missions . 
18668	br-n15	1	2	391166	And Sweeney_Squadron put its first marks on the combat record . 
18669	br-n15	1	3	391177	Every plane that could fly was sent into the air . 
18670	br-n15	2	4	391188	Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan . 
18671	br-n15	2	5	391208	Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target . 
18672	br-n15	2	6	391218	Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte_Gulf area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships . 
18673	br-n15	2	7	391243	Greg himself took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look_for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte . 
18674	br-n15	2	8	391271	Each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs . 
18675	br-n15	3	9	391279	A weapons_carrier took Greg , Todman , Belton , Banjo_Ferguson , and Walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip . 
18676	br-n15	3	10	391306	It was a rough long ride through the mud and pot_holes . 
18677	br-n15	3	11	391318	No one had much to say . 
18678	br-n15	3	12	391325	The sky glowered down at them . 
18679	br-n15	3	13	391332	There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go_on forever . 
18680	br-n15	4	14	391359	The truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle . 
18681	br-n15	4	15	391373	Donovan snatched Greg 's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with_it . 
18682	br-n15	4	16	391392	His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot . 
18683	br-n15	4	17	391413	Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before . 
18684	br-n15	4	18	391429	But his hands and those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure . 
18685	br-n15	5	19	391446	`` I 've got her as neat as I can '' , Donovan said , as he dropped the straps of the Seton harness over Greg 's shoulders . 
18686	br-n15	5	20	391475	`` But this goddamn climate . 
18687	br-n15	5	21	391481	It 's for carabao not airplanes '' . 
18688	br-n15	6	22	391489	`` We 'll make_out . 
18689	br-n15	6	23	391494	Do n't you worry , chief '' , Greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it . 
18690	br-n15	7	24	391512	`` Yeah . 
18691	br-n15	7	25	391515	See_you '' , Donovan said as he jumped off the wing . 
18692	br-n15	7	26	391527	The expression was his trade-mark , his open_sesame to good_luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return . 
18693	br-n15	7	27	391549	At the prearranged time , Greg started the engine and taxied out . 
18694	br-n15	7	28	391562	From the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out_of_sight , he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip . 
18695	br-n15	7	29	391586	He wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad_luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take_off on a combat_mission . 
18696	br-n15	7	30	391610	Yet long before the scheduled time for return , Donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky . 
18697	br-n15	8	31	391630	Greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi_strip , and one_by_one the seven members of his flight fell_in behind him . 
18698	br-n15	8	32	391650	The dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful . 
18699	br-n15	8	33	391663	The pilots ' heads looked ridiculously small . 
18700	br-n15	8	34	391671	The control_tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan . 
18701	br-n15	9	35	391701	Greg 's mission was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships off Tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping_down again . 
18702	br-n15	9	36	391726	To the west , the dark green hills of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes . 
18703	br-n15	9	37	391747	Underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray . 
18704	br-n15	9	38	391758	Water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers . 
18705	br-n15	9	39	391774	The metal strip they had taken_off from was coal_black against the green jungle around it . 
18706	br-n15	9	40	391790	He possessed the fighter pilot 's horror of bad_weather and instrument_flying , and he wondered , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in_this unfamiliar territory . 
18707	br-n15	9	41	391830	He shivered in the warm cockpit . 
18708	br-n15	10	42	391837	The overcast was solid above him . 
18709	br-n15	10	43	391844	As far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it . 
18710	br-n15	10	44	391859	They would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it did n't close_in before they returned . 
18711	br-n15	11	45	391886	Greg pushed the radio button on his throttle . 
18712	br-n15	11	46	391895	`` Todman , let 's try to go under this stuff . 
18713	br-n15	11	47	391907	Stay in close and we 'll go up the valley '' . 
18714	br-n15	12	48	391919	`` Roger , Sweeney '' , Todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above Greg . 
18715	br-n15	13	49	391939	Greg took the formation wide around three A-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf . 
18716	br-n15	13	50	391957	He dropped_down to five_hundred feet , swinging a_little north of the city of Tacloban , and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain . 
18717	br-n15	14	51	391983	The valley was only a_few hundred yards wide with just_about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty degree turn . 
18718	br-n15	14	52	392003	It was only a fifteen minute flight , but before it was through Greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia . 
18719	br-n15	14	53	392025	The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at_times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close_in . 
18720	br-n15	14	54	392047	If the other pilots were worried , they did not show it . 
18721	br-n15	14	55	392060	The formation remained perfect . 
18722	br-n15	15	56	392065	When the sea was visible ahead of them , the relief was as great as if the sun had come_out . 
18723	br-n15	15	57	392086	He spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and_then down the coast . 
18724	br-n15	15	58	392104	Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity . 
18725	br-n15	16	59	392117	Once Todman thought he had spotted a tank and went_down to investigate while Greg covered him . 
18726	br-n15	16	60	392134	`` Somebody beat us to_it '' ! 
18727	br-n15	16	61	392141	Todman said over the radio as he came_back up in formation . 
18728	br-n15	17	62	392153	Visibility continued to be limited , and Greg was never able to get above a_thousand feet . 
18729	br-n15	17	63	392170	It was frustrating . 
18730	br-n15	17	64	392174	His earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights . 
18731	br-n15	17	65	392190	He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill . 
18732	br-n15	17	66	392206	But Greg 's area remained as placid as a Florida dawn . 
18733	br-n15	18	67	392218	Finally , as time began to run_out , he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies . 
18734	br-n15	18	68	392245	The low clouds made bombing difficult . 
18735	br-n15	18	69	392252	There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run . 
18736	br-n15	18	70	392265	The accuracy was deplorable . 
18737	br-n15	18	71	392270	One of Greg 's bombs hung_up , and he was miles from the target before he could get_rid_of it . 
18738	br-n15	18	72	392290	Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew_up jungle . 
18739	br-n15	19	73	392305	With their load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily . 
18740	br-n15	19	74	392319	Greg went_up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home . 
18741	br-n15	19	75	392335	Mercifully , it was still open . 
18742	br-n15	19	76	392342	Like a man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley . 
18743	br-n15	19	77	392361	He was about to make a gas check on his flight when Todman 's voice broke_in : `` Sweeneys ! 
18744	br-n15	19	78	392381	Three bogies . 
18745	br-n15	19	79	392384	Twelve o'clock level '' . 
18746	br-n15	20	80	392389	Greg 's eyes flicked up from his instrument_panel . 
18747	br-n15	20	81	392398	He saw them , specks against the gray , but closing fast . 
18748	br-n15	20	82	392411	They were headed straight for each other on a collision course . 
18749	br-n15	20	83	392423	Friend or enemy ? 
18750	br-n15	20	84	392427	The same old question . 
18751	br-n15	20	85	392432	And only a_few seconds to answer it . 
18752	br-n15	21	86	392440	`` Zeros '' ! 
18753	br-n15	21	87	392444	Todman said excitedly , and hopefully . 
18754	br-n15	22	88	392451	And_then he thought Todman might be right . 
18755	br-n15	22	89	392459	His mind flicked through the mental_pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft_Identification . 
18756	br-n15	22	90	392473	He narrowed the shape down to two : either a Zero or a U._S._Navy type aircraft . 
18757	br-n15	23	91	392490	If it were the enemy , tactically his position was correct . 
18758	br-n15	23	92	392502	Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , American on speed and firepower . 
18759	br-n15	23	93	392515	His present maximum altitude , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages . 
18760	br-n15	23	94	392534	But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he had n't been spotted already . 
18761	br-n15	23	95	392558	But the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course . 
18762	br-n15	24	96	392572	In seconds , Greg made his decision . 
18763	br-n15	25	97	392580	He pushed the radio button . 
18764	br-n15	25	98	392586	`` Sweeney_Blue , hit_the_deck . 
18765	br-n15	25	99	392591	Lots of throttle . 
18766	br-n15	25	100	392595	Todman , you take the one on the left . 
18767	br-n15	25	101	392605	I 'll take the middle . 
18768	br-n15	25	102	392611	Belton , the one on the right . 
18769	br-n15	25	103	392619	If & & & if they 're Japs . 
18770	br-n15	25	104	392628	Let 's make sure first '' . 
18771	br-n15	25	105	392635	Greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two `` Rogers '' . 
18772	br-n15	26	106	392653	The planes , light with most of the gas burned out , responded beautifully . 
18773	br-n15	26	107	392668	Greg 's airspeed indicator was over 350 when he leveled_off just above the trees . 
18774	br-n15	26	108	392683	The opposing aircraft continued to come_on . 
18775	br-n15	26	109	392690	They appeared to be the enemy . 
18776	br-n15	26	110	392697	Greg wished the Air_Corps had continued to camouflage planes . 
18777	br-n15	26	111	392707	There was , of_course , no way for the other planes to get_by them . 
18778	br-n15	26	112	392722	It was a box . 
18779	br-n15	26	113	392727	But they could turn and escape to the east . 
18780	br-n15	27	114	392737	Greg pushed the radio button again . 
18781	br-n15	27	115	392744	`` Todman , drop your second element back . 
18782	br-n15	27	116	392753	If any of us miss , they can pick_up the pieces . 
18783	br-n15	27	117	392765	Now let 's make sure they 're Japs '' . 
18784	br-n15	28	118	392775	Even as he said it , Greg knew they had found the enemy . 
18785	br-n15	28	119	392789	The shapes were unmistakable and the Rising Suns were showing_up , slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom . 
18786	br-n15	29	120	392808	Greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned_on the guns and gun camera and gun sight . 
18787	br-n15	29	121	392826	The circle with the dot in the center showed_up yellow on the reflector glass in_front of him . 
18788	br-n15	29	122	392844	His hands shook . 
18789	br-n15	29	123	392848	`` Arm your guns , Sweeneys '' . 
18790	br-n15	30	124	392856	`` They 're Japs . 
18791	br-n15	30	125	392861	They 're Japs '' , came a high-pitched voice . 
18792	br-n15	31	126	392871	`` Greg to Sweeney_Blue . 
18793	br-n15	31	127	392876	One pass only . 
18794	br-n15	31	128	392880	No turns . 
18795	br-n15	31	129	392883	You 'll bust_your_ass in_this canyon . 
18796	br-n15	31	130	392889	That 's an order '' . 
18797	br-n15	32	131	392895	He moved the flights over against one wall . 
18798	br-n15	32	132	392904	It gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight turn recovery . 
18799	br-n15	32	133	392935	If the turn was too tight , a barrel_roll would bring them out . 
18800	br-n15	32	134	392949	A hell of an altitude for a barrel_roll , but it could be done . 
18801	br-n15	33	135	392964	Greg slammed his throttle to the fire_wall and rammed up the RPM , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting . 
18802	br-n15	33	136	392988	The clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around . 
18803	br-n15	33	137	393002	`` They have n't seen us '' , Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise . 
18804	br-n15	33	138	393019	`` They have n't seen us '' . 
18805	br-n15	33	139	393027	He hit the radio button . 
18806	br-n15	33	140	393033	`` Now , Sweeneys , now . 
18807	br-n15	33	141	393040	Let 's take ' em home '' . 
18808	br-n15	34	142	393048	He hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag . 
18809	br-n15	34	143	393060	Out of the corner of his eye , he watched his wingman move out a_bit and shoot_up with him . 
18810	br-n15	34	144	393080	Perfect , he thought . 
18811	br-n15	35	145	393085	With the rapid rate of closure , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be done . 
18812	br-n15	35	146	393115	Just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving_board . 
18813	br-n15	36	147	393129	He tightened his turn . 
18814	br-n15	36	148	393134	His nose up . 
18815	br-n15	36	149	393138	It was going_to be dangerous . 
18816	br-n15	36	150	393144	Eight aircraft in_this small box . 
18817	br-n15	36	151	393150	Please , dear God , make my pilots good , he prayed . 
18818	br-n15	37	152	393163	He took a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and_then added another . 
18819	br-n15	37	153	393187	The enemy did not veer . 
18820	br-n15	37	154	393193	It did not seem possible that they had n't been spotted . 
18821	br-n15	37	155	393205	Blind fools . 
18822	br-n15	38	156	393208	Now ! 
18823	br-n15	39	157	393210	Greg 's fingers closed on the stick trigger . 
18824	br-n15	39	158	393219	The plane rumbled and slowed . 
18825	br-n15	39	159	393225	Six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished . 
18826	br-n15	39	160	393237	As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them . 
18827	br-n15	39	161	393249	Greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered . 
18828	br-n15	39	162	393258	Luck was with him . 
18829	br-n15	39	163	393263	His burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane . 
18830	br-n15	39	164	393277	The Jap 's propeller flew off in pieces . 
18831	br-n15	39	165	393286	A large piece of engine cowling vanished . 
18832	br-n15	39	166	393294	It was all Greg had time to see . 
18833	br-n15	39	167	393303	His maneuvering for the shot had placed him near the overcast , almost inverted and heading_up into the clouds . 
18834	br-n15	39	168	393323	His speed was dropping rapidly . 
18835	br-n15	39	169	393329	If he spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground . 
18836	br-n15	40	170	393344	Wingman , stay clear , he prayed . 
18837	br-n15	40	171	393352	He pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back . 
18838	br-n15	40	172	393365	He fought the panic of vertigo . 
18839	br-n15	40	173	393372	He had no idea which was up and which was down . 
18840	br-n15	40	174	393384	He held the controls where they had been . 
18841	br-n15	40	175	393393	Sweat popped_out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip . 
18842	br-n15	40	176	393410	His air_speed dropped until he thought he would spin out . 
18843	br-n16	1	1	393421	Over the rattling of fenders , humming of tires and chattering of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles . 
18844	br-n16	1	2	393445	Cool air moving slowly through the open or smashed out side windows hinted of blooming roadside vegetation , and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat . 
18845	br-n16	2	3	393476	`` Moriarty '' , my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone I once_more repeated the absurdity , mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced . 
18846	br-n16	3	4	393511	We were coming to an intersection , turning right , chuffing to a stop . 
18847	br-n16	4	5	393526	Forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican : Moriarty , New_Mexico . 
18848	br-n16	5	6	393565	`` Gracias . 
18849	br-n16	5	7	393568	Adios '' , I said , exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely tapped store of smiles with my host 's daughters . 
18850	br-n16	5	8	393597	I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass . 
18851	br-n16	5	9	393621	Then I saw the father 's head slightly turn ; gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold . 
18852	br-n16	6	10	393641	Autos whizzed past . 
18853	br-n16	6	11	393645	White shirted and conservatively cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze . 
18854	br-n16	7	12	393665	Suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled , and , thumbing hopefully , I saw emergent in windshield flash : red lips , streaming silk of blonde hair and - ah , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair - the leering face of old Herry . 
18855	br-n16	8	13	393712	`` Mor-ee-air-teeeee '' , he shrieked , his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde . 
18856	br-n16	9	14	393730	Over the rapidly diminishing outline of a jump_seat piled high with luggage Herry 's black brushcut was just discernible , near , or enviably near that spot where - hidden - more delicately textured , most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool , oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes . 
18857	br-n16	10	15	393791	Damn his luck . 
18858	br-n16	10	16	393795	I would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and - Well , at_least I would n't have shouted back a taunt . 
18859	br-n16	11	17	393824	Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching , its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me . 
18860	br-n16	11	18	393844	It was stopping . 
18861	br-n16	12	19	393848	Just as I straightened_up with my duffel_bag , I heard : `` Sahjunt_Yoorick , meet Mrs._Major_J._A._Roebuck '' . 
18862	br-n16	12	20	393866	The voice was that of Johnson , tail gunner off another crew . 
18863	br-n16	13	21	393879	Squeezing a look between Johnson 's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady inquired `` Y_'_all_drahve '' ? 
18864	br-n16	14	22	393902	I nodded . 
18865	br-n16	15	23	393905	`` Onleh_one_thiihng '' , Mrs._Roebuck continued . 
18866	br-n16	15	24	393912	`` Ahm goin nawth t ' jawn mah husbun in Sante_Fe , an_y ' all maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt . 
18867	br-n16	15	25	393933	But Corporal_Johnson has alreadeh said it didn_make_no diffrunce_t '_hi-im '' . 
18868	br-n16	16	26	393944	I said that it did n't make any difference to me either , as far as I knew . 
18869	br-n16	17	27	393963	How far I knew will shortly become apparent . 
18870	br-n16	17	28	393972	Let me pass_over the trip to Sante_Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs._Roebuck `` wonduh if the wahtahm speed_limit '' ( 35 m._p._h . ) `` is still in ee-faket '' . 
18871	br-n16	18	29	394007	I let_up on the accelerator , only to gradually reach again the 60 m._p._h. which would , I hoped , overhaul Herry and the blonde , and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I , Mrs._Major_Roebuck settled_down to practicing on Corporal_Johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs. Somebody in Sante_Fe . 
18872	br-n16	19	30	394076	When Johnson ejaculated `` Howsabout my buying us all a nice cold Co-cola , Ma_'_am '' ? 
18873	br-n16	19	31	394093	Mrs._Roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go_on about her son , who was `` onleh a_little younguh than you bawhs '' . 
18874	br-n16	20	32	394116	Johnson never would have believed she had a son that age . 
18875	br-n16	20	33	394128	Mrs._Roebuck thought Johnson was a `` sweet bawh t ' lah lahk thet '' , but her Herman was getting_to be a man , there was no getting_around it . 
18876	br-n16	20	34	394158	`` Just befoh he left foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh , Major_Roebuck an Ah , an Huhmun says ' May Ah hev one too ' ? 
18877	br-n16	20	35	394189	just_as p_'_lite an - an cohnfidunt , an Ah says ' Uh_coahse you cai n't ' , but he says ' Whah nawt , you ah hevin one ' ? 
18878	br-n16	20	36	394219	an Ah coudn ansuh him an so Ah said ' Aw_right , Ah gay-ess , an his fathuh did n uttuh one wohd an aftuh Huhmun was gone , the majuh laughed an tole me thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t_'_gethuh f ' ovuh a yeah , onleh an occasional one , but just the same it was behahn mah back , an Ah doa n think thet 's nahce at_all , d ' you '' ? 
18879	br-n16	21	37	394302	`` No , I do n't '' , Johnson said . 
18880	br-n16	21	38	394313	`` I 'm a good Baptist , and drinking & & & '' . 
18881	br-n16	22	39	394327	Mrs._Roebuck very kindly let me drive through Sante_Fe to a road which would , she said , lead us to Taos and_then Raton and `` eventshahleh '' out of New_Mexico . 
18882	br-n16	22	40	394358	How lightly her `` eventshah-leh '' passed_into_the_crannies where I was storing dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus , and how the word would echo . 
18883	br-n16	22	41	394384	And re-echo . 
18884	br-n16	23	42	394387	Hardly had Mrs._Roebuck driven off when a rusty pick-up truck , father or grandfather of Senor `` Moriarty 's '' Ford sedan , came screeching to a dust swirling stop , and a brown face appeared , its nose threatened by shards of_what had once been the side window . 
18885	br-n16	24	43	394437	`` Get_in , buddies . 
18886	br-n16	24	44	394442	Get_in '' . 
18887	br-n16	24	45	394445	The straight , black hair flopped in a vigorous nod , the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back . 
18888	br-n16	25	46	394468	Johnson unwired the right_hand door , whose window was , like the left one , merely loosely taped fragments of glass , and Johnson wadded himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer . 
18889	br-n16	26	47	394508	`` In back , buddy '' , the driver said to me . 
18890	br-n16	27	48	394521	Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel_bag over the low side rack , I stepped_on the running_board ; it flopped down , sprang back up and gouged my shin . 
18891	br-n16	27	49	394550	The truck was hurtling forward . 
18892	br-n16	27	50	394556	I seized the rack and made a western style flying mount just_in_time , one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel_bag - and merely wrecking my camera , I was to discover later - my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor_boards and - but this is no medical_report . 
18893	br-n16	28	51	394608	I was again in motion and at a speed which belied the truck 's similarity to Senor_X 's Ford turtle . 
18894	br-n16	28	52	394629	Maybe I would beat old Herry to Siberia after_all . 
18895	br-n16	28	53	394639	Whatever satisfaction that might offer . 
18896	br-n16	29	54	394645	Something pulled my leg . 
18897	br-n16	30	55	394650	I drew_back , drawing_back my foot for a kick . 
18898	br-n16	30	56	394660	But it was only Johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing , which half covered the truck cab 's glassless rear_window . 
18899	br-n16	30	57	394682	The way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth I though he was only having a little joke , but , no , he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear . 
18900	br-n16	31	58	394729	`` Wanna beer '' ? 
18901	br-n16	32	59	394734	`` Hell , yes '' , I roared back between dusty lips . 
18902	br-n16	32	60	394747	Did I want a beer ? 
18903	br-n16	32	61	394753	Did an anteater want ants ? 
18904	br-n16	33	62	394759	`` Bueno , amigo . 
18905	br-n16	33	63	394764	Gracias '' , I hollered , my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately doubling the size of my Spanish vocabulary . 
18906	br-n16	34	64	394788	At_once my ears were drowned by a flow of what I took_to_be Spanish , but - the driver 's white teeth flashing at me , the road wildly veering beyond his glistening hair , beyond his gesticulating bottle - it could have been the purest Oxford_English I was half hearing ; I would n't have known the difference . 
18907	br-n16	35	65	394847	Johnson was trying to grab the wheel , though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from_it . 
18908	br-n16	35	66	394867	White teeth suddenly vanishing , the driver slammed the side of his bottle against Johnson 's ear . 
18909	br-n16	36	67	394885	We were off the road , gleaming barbed_wire pulling taut . 
18910	br-n16	36	68	394896	I ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards . 
18911	br-n16	36	69	394915	We were in a field , in a tight , screeching turn . 
18912	br-n16	36	70	394928	Prairie_dogs were popping_up and popping down . 
18913	br-n16	36	71	394935	When I fell on my back , I saw a vulture hovering . 
18914	br-n16	37	72	394948	Just as I got to my knees , there was again the sound of the fence stretching , and I had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously . 
18915	br-n16	37	73	394979	This time no wire came whipping into the truck . 
18916	br-n16	38	74	394989	We were back on the road . 
18917	br-n16	38	75	394996	I regained my squatting position behind the truck cab 's rear_window . 
18918	br-n16	38	76	395008	Johnson 's left_hand was pressed against the side of his head , red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers . 
18919	br-n16	39	77	395027	`` Tee-wah '' , the driver cackled , his black eyes glittering behind dull silver chicken fencing . 
18920	br-n16	39	78	395045	`` That was Tee-wah I was talking . 
18921	br-n16	39	79	395053	You thought I was a Mexican , did n't you , buddy '' ? 
18922	br-n16	40	80	395067	I nodded . 
18923	br-n16	41	81	395070	`` Hell , that 's all_right , buddy '' , the Indian ( I now guessed ) said . 
18924	br-n16	41	82	395089	`` Drink your beer '' . 
18925	br-n16	42	83	395095	Miraculously , the bottle was still in my hand , foam still geysering over my ( luckily ) waterproof watch . 
18926	br-n16	42	84	395116	No sooner had I started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck . 
18927	br-n16	42	85	395130	The beer foamed furiously . 
18928	br-n16	42	86	395135	I drank furiously . 
18929	br-n16	42	87	395139	A long time . 
18930	br-n16	42	88	395143	Emptied the bottle . 
18931	br-n16	43	89	395147	Teeth again flashing back at me , the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which `` amigo '' appeared every_so_often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound . 
18932	br-n16	43	90	395179	I bobbed my head each time it appeared . 
18933	br-n16	44	91	395188	Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son_of_a_bitch '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer_bottle into Johnson 's quivering ribs . 
18934	br-n16	45	92	395223	A big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning . 
18935	br-n16	45	93	395234	Beyond it the gray road stretched a long , long way . 
18936	br-n16	45	94	395246	The car was just about to us , its driver 's fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a family in Sante_Fe - on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human_beings desperately needed rescue . 
18937	br-n16	46	95	395291	I tossed the bottle . 
18938	br-n16	46	96	395296	High , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car 's steel roof . 
18939	br-n16	46	97	395313	Too high . 
18940	br-n16	46	98	395316	On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash . 
18941	br-n16	47	99	395328	`` Aye-yah-ah-ah '' ! 
18942	br-n16	48	100	395332	The Indian was again raising his bottle , but to my astonished relief - probably only a fraction of Johnson 's - the bottle this time went to the Indian 's lips . 
18943	br-n16	49	101	395365	Another car was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill . 
18944	br-n16	49	102	395380	I started looking on the splintery truck_bed for a piece of board , a dirt clod - anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer_bottle . 
18945	br-n16	50	103	395412	We were slowing . 
18946	br-n16	50	104	395416	In the ditch sand was white and soft looking , only an occasional pebble discernible , faintly gleaming . 
18947	br-n16	50	105	395435	But Johnson could n't quickly unwire the truck door , and if I escaped , he might suffer . 
18948	br-n16	51	106	395454	The car was approaching fast . 
18949	br-n16	51	107	395460	On the truck_bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery ; with more time I could have loosened a small burr or cotter_pin - 
18950	br-n16	52	108	395487	Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought_of the coins in my pocket . 
18951	br-n16	52	109	395502	There was no time to pick_out a penny ; I got a coin between my thumb and forefinger , leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile . 
18952	br-n16	53	110	395543	There was a blur just under my focus of vision , a crash ; the car 's far windshield panel turned_into a silver web with a dark hole in_the center . 
18953	br-n16	54	111	395574	I heard the screech of brakes behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me . 
18954	br-n16	54	112	395591	Looking_back I saw a gray-haired man getting_out of his halted car and trying to read our license_number . 
18955	br-n16	55	113	395609	`` S-s-sahjunt '' . 
18956	br-n16	55	114	395613	Johnson 's fat hand , another bottle were protruding from the truck cab , and that self proclaimed Baptist teetotaler , had a bottle at his own lips . 
18957	br-n16	56	115	395642	Two cars came over a crest , their chrome and glass flashing . 
18958	br-n16	56	116	395655	The Indian 's arm whipped sidewise - there was a flash of amber and froth , the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car . 
18959	br-n16	57	117	395685	Brakes shrieked behind us . 
18960	br-n16	57	118	395690	I saw Johnson 's bottle snatched from his hand , saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car . 
18961	br-n16	57	119	395714	This time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women . 
18962	br-n16	57	120	395728	I looked_back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the car 's rear_window . 
18963	br-n16	58	121	395744	`` Drink , you son_of_a_bitch '' ! 
18964	br-n16	58	122	395751	I quickly turned_around and began to drink . 
18965	br-n16	58	123	395759	But the Indian was jabbing another bottle toward Johnson . 
18966	br-n17	1	1	395769	I guided her to the divan , turned_off the TV , faced her . 
18967	br-n17	1	2	395783	She sat quietly , staring at me from the wide eyes . 
18968	br-n17	1	3	395795	And what eyes they were . 
18969	br-n17	1	4	395801	Big and dark , a melting , golden brown . 
18970	br-n17	1	5	395811	Eyes like hot honey , eyes that sizzled . 
18971	br-n17	1	6	395820	Plus flawless skin , smooth brow and cheeks , lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them . 
18972	br-n17	1	7	395842	It was a disturbingly familiar face , too , but I could n't remember where we had met . 
18973	br-n17	2	8	395861	I said , `` Do we know each other , Miss '' ? 
18974	br-n17	3	9	395874	`` No , I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all I could think_of was - '' . 
18975	br-n17	3	10	395903	This time she stopped the rush of words herself . 
18976	br-n17	3	11	395913	`` I 'm sorry . 
18977	br-n17	3	12	395918	Shall I go_on '' ? 
18978	br-n17	3	13	395923	She smiled . 
18979	br-n17	3	14	395926	It was her first smile . 
18980	br-n17	3	15	395932	But worth waiting for . 
18981	br-n17	4	16	395937	`` Sure '' . 
18982	br-n17	4	17	395941	I said . 
18983	br-n17	4	18	395944	`` But one word at_a_time , O._K . '' ? 
18984	br-n17	4	19	395954	She was still hugging the stained coat around her , so I said , `` Relax , let me take your things . 
18985	br-n17	4	20	395977	Would you like a drink , or coffee '' ? 
18986	br-n17	5	21	395987	`` No , thanks '' . 
18987	br-n17	5	22	395993	She stood_up , pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off , then let_out a high-pitched scream and I let_out a low-pitched , wobbling sound like a muffler blowing_out . 
18988	br-n17	5	23	396027	She was wearing nothing beneath the coat . 
18989	br-n17	5	24	396035	She jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon_enough . 
18990	br-n17	5	25	396052	There had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing_out , and now I was certain I 'd seen her somewhere before . 
18991	br-n17	6	26	396080	`` I forgot '' ! she yelped . 
18992	br-n17	6	27	396088	`` Oh , do forgive me . 
18993	br-n17	6	28	396095	I 'm sorry '' ! 
18994	br-n17	7	29	396100	`` I forgive - '' . 
18995	br-n17	8	30	396106	`` That 's what started all the trouble in_the_first_place . 
18996	br-n17	8	31	396116	Oh , dear , I 'm all unstrung '' . 
18997	br-n17	9	32	396126	`` You and me both , dear . 
18998	br-n17	9	33	396134	Have n't we & & & have n't I seen you & & & . 
18999	br-n17	9	34	396149	I mean , surely we 've - '' . 
19000	br-n17	10	35	396158	`` You may have seen me on TV '' , she said . 
19001	br-n17	10	36	396171	`` I 've done several filmed commercials for - '' . 
19002	br-n17	11	37	396182	Then it hit me . 
19003	br-n17	11	38	396187	`` ZING '' ! 
19004	br-n17	11	39	396191	I cried . 
19005	br-n17	12	40	396194	`` Why , yes . 
19006	br-n17	12	41	396199	And you recognized me '' ? 
19007	br-n17	13	42	396205	`` Yes , indeed . 
19008	br-n17	13	43	396210	In_fact , I was watching you on_that little seventeen inch screen when you rang my bell . 
19009	br-n17	13	44	396227	Man , you rang - it was in_color , too , Miss , and & & & Miss ? 
19010	br-n17	13	45	396246	What 's your name , anyway ? 
19011	br-n17	13	46	396253	Ah , you were splendid '' . 
19012	br-n17	13	47	396260	I sat by her on the divan . 
19013	br-n17	13	48	396268	`` Splendid . 
19014	br-n17	13	49	396271	In a waterfall and all that '' . 
19015	br-n17	14	50	396279	`` That 's the last one we did . 
19016	br-n17	14	51	396288	That was a fun one '' . 
19017	br-n17	15	52	396295	`` I 'll bet . 
19018	br-n17	15	53	396300	It was fun for me , all_right . 
19019	br-n17	15	54	396308	I do n't mean to pry , but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles ? 
19020	br-n17	15	55	396325	I mean : Is advertising honest ? 
19021	br-n17	16	56	396332	`` It depends_on who does it . 
19022	br-n17	16	57	396339	I never wear anything at_all . 
19023	br-n17	16	58	396345	It would n't - would n't seem fair , somehow '' . 
19024	br-n17	17	59	396357	`` I could n't agree with you more '' . 
19025	br-n17	18	60	396367	`` I really do have something important to tell you , Mr._Scott . 
19026	br-n17	18	61	396380	About the murder '' . 
19027	br-n17	19	62	396385	`` Murder ? 
19028	br-n17	19	63	396388	Oh , yeah '' , I said . 
19029	br-n17	19	64	396396	`` Tell me about the murder '' . 
19030	br-n17	20	65	396404	She told me . 
19031	br-n17	20	66	396408	ZING was the creation of two men , Louis_Thor and Bill_Blake , partners in ZING ! 
19032	br-n17	20	67	396424	, Inc. . 
19033	br-n17	20	68	396427	They 'd peddled the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when - with the addition of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising_campaign - sales had soared practically into orbit . 
19034	br-n17	20	69	396474	Their product had been endorsed by Good_Housekeeping , the A._M._A. , and the Veterinary_Journal , among other repositories of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you did n't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you did n't bathe . 
19035	br-n17	21	70	396525	My lovely caller - Joyce_Holland was her name - had previously done three filmed commercials for ZING , and this_evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of Louis_Thor . 
19036	br-n17	21	71	396562	The water in Thor 's big swimming_pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds - fashioned , of_course , from ZING - Joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath '' while cameras rolled . 
19037	br-n17	21	72	396612	The finished - and drastically cut - product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the pool 's surface clad in layers of lavender lather , and I had a hunch this item was going_to sell tons and tons of soap ; even to clean men and boys . 
19038	br-n17	22	73	396669	Joyce went_on , `` When we 'd finished , Lou - Mr._Thor - asked me to stay a_little longer . 
19039	br-n17	22	74	396689	He wanted a_few stills for magazine ads , he said . 
19040	br-n17	22	75	396700	Everybody left and I stayed in the pool , then Lou came_back alone and leaped into the pool too . 
19041	br-n17	22	76	396720	And he did n't have any clothes on '' . 
19042	br-n17	23	77	396730	`` He did n't '' ! 
19043	br-n17	24	78	396736	`` Yes , he did n't . 
19044	br-n17	24	79	396743	Did , I mean '' . 
19045	br-n17	24	80	396749	She paused . 
19046	br-n17	24	81	396752	`` Did leap into the pool , and did n't have anything on . 
19047	br-n17	24	82	396766	Anyway , it was evident what he had_in_mind '' . 
19048	br-n17	25	83	396776	`` You got_away , did n't you '' ? 
19049	br-n17	26	84	396785	`` Yes . 
19050	br-n17	26	85	396788	He caught_up_with me once and grabbed me , but I was all covered with ZING - it 's very slippery , you know '' . 
19051	br-n17	27	86	396813	`` I did n't know . 
19052	br-n17	27	87	396819	I would n't have the stuff in the house . 
19053	br-n17	27	88	396829	But I 'm pleased to hear - '' . 
19054	br-n17	28	89	396838	`` So I just scooted out of his clutches . 
19055	br-n17	28	90	396848	I swam like_mad , got_out of the pool , grabbed my robe , and ran to the car . 
19056	br-n17	28	91	396867	The keys were still in it , and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I 'd changed '' . 
19057	br-n17	29	92	396901	She 'd driven_around for_a_while , Joyce said , then , thinking Louis_Thor would have calmed_down by that time , she 'd gone_back to his home on Bryn_Mawr_Drive , parked in_front , and walked toward the pool . 
19058	br-n17	29	93	396938	While several yards from_it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she 'd seen two men on her left at the pool 's edge . 
19059	br-n17	29	94	396963	She went_on : 
19060	br-n17	30	95	396966	`` A man was holding onto Lou , holding him up . 
19061	br-n17	30	96	396978	Maybe Lou was only unconscious , but right then I thought he must be dead . 
19062	br-n17	30	97	396994	The man shoved him into the water , then ran past the cabana . 
19063	br-n17	30	98	397008	There 's a walk there that goes out to Quebec_Drive . 
19064	br-n17	30	99	397019	I was so scared , well , I just ran to my car and came here '' . 
19065	br-n17	31	100	397037	`` You know who the other man was '' ? 
19066	br-n17	32	101	397047	`` No , I never did see his face . 
19067	br-n17	32	102	397057	I did n't get a good look at him at_all , his back was to me , and I was so scared . 
19068	br-n17	32	103	397080	It was just somebody in a man 's suit . 
19069	br-n17	32	104	397090	But I 'm sure the other one was Lou '' . 
19070	br-n17	33	105	397101	What Joyce wanted me to do was go_to Thor 's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes - and handbag containing her identification . 
19071	br-n17	33	106	397131	She realized I 'd have_to notify the police , but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name . 
19072	br-n17	34	107	397150	Her impact in the ZING commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series , Underwater_Western_Eye , a documentary type show to be sponsored by Oatnut_Grits . 
19073	br-n17	34	108	397184	But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor 's wife , Mrs._Oatnut_Grits . 
19074	br-n17	34	109	397208	Or at_least not to Joyce . 
19075	br-n17	35	110	397214	`` And I so want the part '' , she said . 
19076	br-n17	35	111	397226	`` The commercials have just been for money , there has n't been any real incentive for me to do them , but in Underwater_Western_Eye I 'd have a chance to act . 
19077	br-n17	35	112	397259	I could show what I can do '' . 
19078	br-n17	36	113	397268	As_far_as I was concerned , she had already and had dandily shown what she could do . 
19079	br-n17	36	114	397285	But I promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at_all , only as a last_resort . 
19080	br-n17	36	115	397303	Seeming much relieved , she smiled one of those worth waiting for smiles , and I smiled all_the_way into the bedroom . 
19081	br-n17	36	116	397325	There I got my Colt Special and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went_back into the front_room . 
19082	br-n17	37	117	397346	Joyce squirmed a_little on the divan . 
19083	br-n17	37	118	397353	`` I 'm starting to itch '' , she said . 
19084	br-n17	38	119	397364	`` Itch '' ? 
19085	br-n17	39	120	397368	`` Yes , I 'm still all covered with that soap . 
19086	br-n17	39	121	397380	I was loaded with suds when I ran_away , and I have n't had a chance to wash it off . 
19087	br-n17	39	122	397401	Mmmm , it sure itches '' . 
19088	br-n17	40	123	397408	`` You might as_well wait here while I 'm gone , so you can use my shower if you 'd like '' . 
19089	br-n17	41	124	397431	`` Oh , I 'd love to '' . 
19090	br-n17	41	125	397440	I showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really do n't mind , I think I 'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a_few minutes in your tub . 
19091	br-n17	41	126	397481	That always relaxes me . 
19092	br-n17	41	127	397486	Does n't it you '' ? 
19093	br-n17	42	128	397492	`` Only when I do it '' . 
19094	br-n17	42	129	397500	I shook my head . 
19095	br-n17	42	130	397505	One of my virtues or vices is a sort_of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound_effects and glorious living color . 
19096	br-n17	42	131	397524	`` Soak as_long_as you want , Joyce . 
19097	br-n17	42	132	397532	It 'll probably be at_least an hour or two before I can check back with you . 
19098	br-n17	42	133	397549	So you 'll have everything all to yourself , doggone '' . 
19099	br-n17	43	134	397561	I looked at my watch . 
19100	br-n17	43	135	397567	Ten after nine . 
19101	br-n17	43	136	397571	Time to go , I supposed . 
19102	br-n17	43	137	397578	`` Well , goodbye '' , I said . 
19103	br-n17	44	138	397587	`` Goodbye . 
19104	br-n17	44	139	397590	You 'd better hurry '' . 
19105	br-n17	45	140	397596	`` Oh , you can count_on that '' . 
19106	br-n17	46	141	397605	She smiled slightly . 
19107	br-n17	46	142	397609	Softly . 
19108	br-n17	46	143	397611	Warmly . 
19109	br-n17	46	144	397613	`` Do n't hurry too_much . 
19110	br-n17	46	145	397619	I 'll be soaking for at_least half an hour '' . 
19111	br-n17	47	146	397630	That was all she said . 
19112	br-n17	47	147	397636	But suddenly those hot honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them . 
19113	br-n17	47	148	397653	However , when there 's a job to be done , I 'm a monstrosity of grim determination , I like to think . 
19114	br-n17	47	149	397677	I spun about and clattered through the front_room to the door . 
19115	br-n17	47	150	397689	As I went_out , I could hear water pouring in the shower . 
19116	br-n17	47	151	397702	Hot water . 
19117	br-n17	47	152	397705	She would n't be taking a cold shower . 
19118	br-n17	47	153	397714	Hell , she could n't . 
19119	br-n17	48	154	397720	Bryn_Mawr_Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan , and it took me less_than five minutes to get there . 
19120	br-n17	48	155	397742	But the scene was not the quiet , calm scene I 'd expected . 
19121	br-n17	48	156	397756	Four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars . 
19122	br-n17	48	157	397773	Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds . 
19123	br-n17	48	158	397783	I followed a shrubbery lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool . 
19124	br-n17	48	159	397797	Two uniformed officers , a_couple_of plain-clothesmen I knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left . 
19125	br-n17	48	160	397824	At the pool 's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned , and on the water 's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp looking lather . 
19126	br-n17	48	161	397853	A_few yards beyond the group of men , a man 's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra . 
19127	br-n17	49	162	397877	Lieutenant_Rawlins , one of the plain-clothesmen , spotted me and said , `` Hi , Shell '' , and walked toward me . 
19128	br-n17	49	163	397900	`` How 'd you hear about this one '' ? 
19129	br-n17	49	164	397910	I grinned , but ignored the question . 
19130	br-n17	49	165	397918	He did n't push it ; Rawlins worked out of Central_Homicide and we 'd been friends for years . 
19131	br-n17	50	166	397937	He filled me in . 
19132	br-n17	50	167	397942	A call to the police had been placed from here a_couple_of minutes after nine p._m. , and the first police_car had arrived two or three minutes after_that - 10 minutes ago now . 
19133	br-n17	50	168	397975	Present at the scene - in_addition to the dead man , who was indeed Louis_Thor - had been Thor 's partner Bill_Blake , and Antony_Rose , an advertising_agency executive who handled the ZING account . 
19134	br-n17	50	169	398010	Neither of them , I understood , had been present at the filming session earlier . 
19135	br-n17	51	170	398026	`` What were they doing here '' ? 
19136	br-n17	51	171	398034	I asked Rawlins . 
19137	br-n17	52	172	398038	`` They were supposed to meet Thor at nine p._m. for a conference concerning the ad_campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff '' . 
19138	br-n17	53	173	398068	`` Yeah , I 've heard more about SX-21 than space exploration lately . 
19139	br-n17	53	174	398082	What is the gunk '' ? 
19140	br-n17	54	175	398088	`` How would I know ? 
19141	br-n17	54	176	398094	It 's a secret . 
19142	br-n17	54	177	398099	That was the new advertising angle - something about a Lloyd's_of_London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient . 
19143	br-n17	54	178	398120	Actually , only two men know what the formula is , Blake and '' - He stopped and looked at Thor 's body . 
19144	br-n17	55	179	398144	I said , `` O._K. , so now only Blake knows . 
19145	br-n17	55	180	398156	How 's it strike you , foul or fair '' ? 
19146	br-n17	56	181	398167	`` Ca n't say yet . 
19147	br-n17	56	182	398173	Deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked_in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on ' em . 
19148	br-n17	56	183	398194	The PM might show he drowned instead , but that 's what the once-over-lightly gives us . 
19149	br-n17	56	184	398211	Accident , murder , suicide - take your pick '' . 
19150	br-n17	57	185	398222	`` I 'll pick murder . 
19151	br-n17	57	186	398228	Anything else '' ? 
19152	br-n17	58	187	398232	`` According to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a hooked pole from the pool equipment locker and started hauling him out . 
19153	br-n20	1	1	398267	They were west of the Sabine , but_only_God_knew_where . 
19154	br-n20	2	2	398276	For three days , their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea . 
19155	br-n20	2	3	398298	Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson ; suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs . 
19156	br-n20	2	4	398331	And the valley stretched endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze . 
19157	br-n20	3	5	398361	Ben_Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen . 
19158	br-n20	3	6	398379	`` Hoa-whup '' ! he commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips . 
19159	br-n20	4	7	398404	He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face . 
19160	br-n20	4	8	398424	He spat . 
19161	br-n20	4	9	398427	The dust thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton . 
19162	br-n20	4	10	398439	He moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing , grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs . 
19163	br-n20	4	11	398465	The burning air dried his sweat soaked clothes in salt edged patches . 
19164	br-n20	5	12	398478	He cleared his throat and wet his lips . 
19165	br-n20	5	13	398487	As cheerfully as possible , he said , `` Well , I guess we could all do with a little drink '' . 
19166	br-n20	6	14	398510	He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel . 
19167	br-n20	6	15	398521	They could no_longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat_bag that cooled it by evaporation . 
19168	br-n20	6	16	398537	The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste . 
19169	br-n20	6	17	398549	But it was water . 
19170	br-n20	6	18	398554	Thank_the_Lord , they still had water ! 
19171	br-n20	7	19	398561	He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity . 
19172	br-n20	7	20	398570	He took a long but carefully controlled draught . 
19173	br-n20	7	21	398579	He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane_deck . 
19174	br-n20	7	22	398594	She took it grudgingly , her dark eyes baleful as they met his . 
19175	br-n20	8	23	398608	She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face . 
19176	br-n20	8	24	398625	She set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked_on scornfully . 
19177	br-n20	9	25	398649	`` What happens when there 's no more water '' ? she asked smolderingly . 
19178	br-n20	10	26	398664	She was like charcoal , he thought - dark , opaque , explosive . 
19179	br-n20	10	27	398678	Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal . 
19180	br-n20	10	28	398689	Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights_up . 
19181	br-n20	10	29	398699	And all_the_time , she had the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burning on its under_side , but not visibly . 
19182	br-n20	11	30	398724	A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice . 
19183	br-n20	12	31	398742	`` There must be some water under there '' . 
19184	br-n20	12	32	398752	He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river . 
19185	br-n20	12	33	398765	`` We can get it if we dig '' , he said patiently . 
19186	br-n20	13	34	398779	`` And add fever to our troubles '' ? she scoffed . 
19187	br-n20	13	35	398791	`` Or do you want to see if I can stand fever , too '' ? 
19188	br-n20	14	36	398807	`` We can boil it '' , he said . 
19189	br-n20	15	37	398817	Her chin sharpened . 
19190	br-n20	15	38	398821	`` We 're lost and burning_up already '' , she bit_out tensely . 
19191	br-n20	15	39	398834	`` The tires are rattling on the wheels now . 
19192	br-n20	15	40	398844	They 'll roll off in another day . 
19193	br-n20	15	41	398852	There was no valley like this on your map . 
19194	br-n20	15	42	398862	You do n't even know where we 're headed . 
19195	br-n20	16	43	398872	`` Hettie '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we 're still headed west . 
19196	br-n20	16	44	398891	Somewhere , we 'll hit a trail '' . 
19197	br-n20	17	45	398900	`` Somewhere ! '' she repeated . 
19198	br-n20	17	46	398907	`` Maybe in_time to make a cross and dig our graves '' . 
19199	br-n20	18	47	398920	His wide mouth compressed . 
19200	br-n20	18	48	398925	In_a_way , he could n't blame her . 
19201	br-n20	18	49	398933	He had picked_out this pathless trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon . 
19202	br-n20	19	50	398961	It had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned_out . 
19203	br-n20	19	51	398979	It was n't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her . 
19204	br-n20	19	52	398996	She had hated the whole idea before they started . 
19205	br-n20	19	53	399006	Actually , she had hated him before she ever saw him . 
19206	br-n20	19	54	399018	It had been five days too late before he learned that she 'd gone_through the wedding_ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administered by her mother . 
19207	br-n20	20	55	399045	The bitterness of their wedding_night still ripped within him like an open wound . 
19208	br-n20	20	56	399059	She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder . 
19209	br-n20	20	57	399075	He had left her inviolate , thinking familiarity would gentle her in_time . 
19210	br-n20	20	58	399088	But each mile westward , she had hated him the deeper . 
19211	br-n20	21	59	399100	He stared at the dipper , turning it over_and_over in his wide , calloused hands . 
19212	br-n20	21	60	399116	`` I suppose '' , he muttered , `` I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement '' . 
19213	br-n20	22	61	399147	`` Do n't try to be noble '' ! 
19214	br-n20	22	62	399156	Her laugh was hard . 
19215	br-n20	22	63	399161	`` They would n't have sold me in_the_first_place if there 'd been food enough to go_around '' . 
19216	br-n20	23	64	399179	He winced . 
19217	br-n20	23	65	399182	`` Hettie , they did n't sell you '' , he said miserably . 
19218	br-n20	23	66	399196	`` They knew I was a good sharecrop_farmer back in Carolina , but out West was a chance to build a real farm of_our_own . 
19219	br-n20	23	67	399221	They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what 's inside of them . 
19220	br-n20	23	68	399254	Without money or property , what would you have had at Baton_Rouge '' ? 
19221	br-n20	24	69	399268	`` I might have starved , but at_least I would n't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt '' ! 
19222	br-n20	25	70	399290	He darkened under his heavy burn . 
19223	br-n20	25	71	399297	His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead . 
19224	br-n20	26	72	399308	To his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze . 
19225	br-n20	26	73	399318	The valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp_limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead . 
19226	br-n20	27	74	399348	Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them - heavy , ominous , leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills . 
19227	br-n20	27	75	399377	He had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina . 
19228	br-n20	28	76	399404	He hollered hoarsely , `` Hang_on '' ! and goaded the oxen as he yelled . 
19229	br-n20	28	77	399420	He wanted to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm . 
19230	br-n20	28	78	399433	Too late , he realized that in turning , he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge . 
19231	br-n20	29	79	399461	He swung up over the wheel . 
19232	br-n20	29	80	399468	`` You had_better get inside '' , he warned her . 
19233	br-n20	30	81	399479	But she sat on in stubborn silence . 
19234	br-n20	31	82	399487	The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel . 
19235	br-n20	31	83	399500	Frozen , they stared at it whirling down the valley , gouging and spitting_out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound_dog cracking marrowbones . 
19236	br-n20	31	84	399526	The six ton Conestoga began to whip and shake . 
19237	br-n20	32	85	399536	Their world turned black . 
19238	br-n20	32	86	399541	It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence . 
19239	br-n20	32	87	399553	The heavens opened , pelting them with hail the size of walnuts . 
19240	br-n20	32	88	399566	And_then came the water - not rain , but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket . 
19241	br-n20	32	89	399587	Walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash_floods . 
19242	br-n20	32	90	399604	Through the splash of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , gnashing big chunks out of the banks . 
19243	br-n20	33	91	399635	The jetting , frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff . 
19244	br-n20	33	92	399650	The dangerous current upon the prairie ceased , but the water stood and kept_on rising . 
19245	br-n20	33	93	399666	They cringed under sodden covers , listening to the waves slop against the bottom . 
19246	br-n20	34	94	399681	The cloudburst cut_off abruptly . 
19247	br-n20	34	95	399686	They were engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry murmur of the river . 
19248	br-n20	34	96	399706	Then the darkness thinned , and there was light again , and_then bright sunlight . 
19249	br-n20	35	97	399721	Beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the hurricane_deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills . 
19250	br-n20	35	98	399753	The water_level was higher than their hubs . 
19251	br-n20	35	99	399761	Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored . 
19252	br-n20	36	100	399772	There was no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere . 
19253	br-n20	36	101	399798	Clumps of brush rode down the ribbon . 
19254	br-n20	36	102	399806	Now_and_then , the glistening side of a half swamped object showed as it swept past . 
19255	br-n20	37	103	399822	The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hugging her shoulders and still trembling . 
19256	br-n20	37	104	399841	Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for Ben . 
19257	br-n20	38	105	399857	Out of compulsion to say something cheery , Ben_Prime blurted , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit . 
19258	br-n20	38	106	399885	At_least , the wheels dug in . 
19259	br-n20	38	107	399892	The soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' . 
19260	br-n20	39	108	399905	His wife did n't give a sign she 'd heard . 
19261	br-n20	39	109	399916	She was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current . 
19262	br-n20	39	110	399928	Somebody was riding the tree . 
19263	br-n20	39	111	399934	It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting astride an upright branch . 
19264	br-n20	40	112	399953	She did not call_out . 
19265	br-n20	40	113	399958	But as the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell . 
19266	br-n20	40	114	399976	They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend . 
19267	br-n20	40	115	399988	It speared up_into_the_air , then sinking back , the up jutting branch turned slowly . 
19268	br-n20	40	116	400003	The pale blob of the woman disappeared . 
19269	br-n20	41	117	400011	`` There 's the one who 's lucky '' ! the girl murmured harshly . 
19270	br-n20	42	118	400026	Ben 's eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson . 
19271	br-n20	42	119	400044	Then he took_off his wet boots and dropped_down into the water to talk with the beasts , needing their comfort more than they needed his . 
19272	br-n20	43	120	400070	It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon , half swimming his way , for he was not a tall man . 
19273	br-n20	43	121	400097	He let_down the tailgate and was knocked_over by the sluice of water . 
19274	br-n20	44	122	400110	He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed_grain forward . 
19275	br-n20	44	123	400127	They were already swollen to bursting . 
19276	br-n20	44	124	400134	Of all their worldly_belongings , next_to the oxen and his gun , the seed_grain had been the most treasured . 
19277	br-n20	44	125	400154	It was spoiled now for seed , and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it . 
19278	br-n20	44	126	400183	The oxen might as_well enjoy it . 
19279	br-n20	45	127	400190	He examined the water_marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished . 
19280	br-n20	45	128	400204	The waters lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels ; there was not a match width of damp mark to show they were receding . 
19281	br-n20	46	129	400235	He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley . 
19282	br-n20	46	130	400255	A terrible , numbing sense of futility swept_over him . 
19283	br-n20	47	131	400265	He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat . 
19284	br-n20	47	132	400277	Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen . 
19285	br-n20	47	133	400290	The spokes were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece . 
19286	br-n20	48	134	400309	Hope surged within him . 
19287	br-n20	48	135	400314	He swung toward the front to give the news to Hettie , then stopped , barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate . 
19288	br-n20	48	136	400341	Still , he felt better . 
19289	br-n20	48	137	400347	A tight wagon meant so much . 
19290	br-n20	49	138	400354	He got a small fire started and put_on bacon and coffee . 
19291	br-n20	49	139	400366	He poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour , salvaging the chunky , watery messes for biscuits of a sort . 
19292	br-n20	49	140	400390	Their jams and jellies had not suffered . 
19293	br-n20	49	141	400398	He found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save . 
19294	br-n20	49	142	400416	Now he broke them open , hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie . 
19295	br-n20	50	143	400433	His long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time . 
19296	br-n20	50	144	400461	He furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins , leaving the ribs and wagon open . 
19297	br-n20	51	145	400478	He looked thoughtfully at his wife 's trunk , holding her meager treasures . 
19298	br-n20	51	146	400492	He said hesitantly , `` Hettie , I do n't figure your things got wet too_much . 
19299	br-n20	51	147	400509	That 's a good trunk . 
19300	br-n20	51	148	400515	If you want to get them aired '' . 
19301	br-n20	52	149	400524	She said without turning her head , `` After that rain beating in atop the dust , there is n't a thing that won n't be streaked '' . 
19302	br-n20	53	150	400553	He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs . 
19303	br-p07	1	1	400574	Spencer said nothing . 
19304	br-p07	2	2	400578	`` Is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense '' ? 
19305	br-p07	3	3	400594	Spencer shook his head . 
19306	br-p07	4	4	400599	Alexander said , `` Answer me properly , Spencer '' . 
19307	br-p07	5	5	400610	Spencer was_quiet for a moment longer , then he said , `` There is nothing I want to say , Captain '' . 
19308	br-p07	6	6	400633	`` Very_well '' . 
19309	br-p07	6	7	400637	Alexander walked away . 
19310	br-p07	6	8	400641	Naval procedure , he thought , had its moments of grim humor . 
19311	br-p07	6	9	400654	Philip_Spencer had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain , yet it seemed in_order to chide him for a lapse of proper address . 
19312	br-p07	7	10	400678	During the morning hours , it became clear that the arrest of Spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the Somers . 
19313	br-p07	7	11	400703	Those named in the Greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty , so_as to be near Spencer , watching an opportunity to communicate with him . 
19314	br-p07	7	12	400737	Hostile glances were flashed at both Alexander and Gansevoort . 
19315	br-p07	7	13	400747	The two met in the Captain 's cabin . 
19316	br-p07	8	14	400756	`` What is the next step , Captain '' ? 
19317	br-p07	9	15	400766	`` More arrests , I fear '' . 
19318	br-p07	10	16	400774	In your opinion , who is this E._Andrews on the ' certain ' list `` ? 
19319	br-p07	11	17	400790	`` Cromwell , of_course . 
19320	br-p07	11	18	400795	He is the oldest and most experienced of the lot . 
19321	br-p07	11	19	400806	He saw the dangers , not the glories of being identified as a mutineer . 
19322	br-p07	11	20	400821	Somehow he talked Spencer into letting him use another name '' . 
19323	br-p07	12	21	400833	There was a tap at the door and Oliver entered with the word that Heiser wished to see the Captain . 
19324	br-p07	13	22	400854	`` Have him come_in '' . 
19325	br-p07	14	23	400860	Heiser , breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling news that the handspikes , heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places . 
19326	br-p07	15	24	400886	`` And also , sir , two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely . 
19327	br-p07	15	25	400907	An African knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by McKinley and Green . 
19328	br-p07	15	26	400923	McKinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into Spencer 's possession and that '' - 
19329	br-p07	16	27	400944	`` Where did you gather all this information , Heiser ? 
19330	br-p07	16	28	400955	Who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who '' - 
19331	br-p07	17	29	400969	He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with Gansevoort and Heiser behind him . 
19332	br-p07	17	30	400991	A glance revealed that the main topgallant_mast had been carried_away . 
19333	br-p07	17	31	401002	The aimless milling_about of_what had been a well trained , well organized crew struck Alexander with horror . 
19334	br-p07	17	32	401020	He bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction . 
19335	br-p07	18	33	401058	Adrien_Deslonde hastened to Alexander 's side . 
19336	br-p07	18	34	401065	`` Small violently jerked the weather royal_brace with full intention to carry_away the mast . 
19337	br-p07	18	35	401080	I saw him myself and it was done after consultation with Cromwell . 
19338	br-p07	18	36	401093	I swear it , sir '' . 
19339	br-p07	19	37	401100	And it was clear that Adrien was not mistaken , for both Small and Cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant_mast till Philip_Spencer had given the signal to obey . 
19340	br-p07	19	38	401137	Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work . 
19341	br-p07	19	39	401152	Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed . 
19342	br-p07	19	40	401175	Their strategy was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by Philip_Spencer 's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated . 
19343	br-p07	20	41	401202	When the mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers . 
19344	br-p07	21	42	401239	Spencer 's potential followers were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal . 
19345	br-p07	21	43	401277	One of the missing handspikes came_out of its hiding_place after Midshipman_Tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by Seaman_Wilson . 
19346	br-p07	21	44	401295	Tillotson had reported the man to Gansevoort and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by Wilson , brandishing the weapon . 
19347	br-p07	21	45	401321	Wilson , shackled and snarling , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green , McKee and McKinley . 
19348	br-p07	21	46	401344	Not a man on the brig , loyal or villainous , could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny . 
19349	br-p07	22	47	401371	In the tiny cabin , Alexander met with Gansevoort , Heiser and Wales to speak and to listen . 
19350	br-p07	22	48	401390	Three days had passed since Spencer 's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears . 
19351	br-p07	23	49	401409	Gansevoort said , `` It requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely . 
19352	br-p07	23	50	401430	To have the Greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed . 
19353	br-p07	23	51	401447	From actions aboard , it is easy to guess that Spencer 's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate '' . 
19354	br-p07	24	52	401470	`` Well '' , Heiser ventured , `` why do n't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' - 
19355	br-p07	25	53	401490	`` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander broke_in . 
19356	br-p07	25	54	401502	`` There is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners . 
19357	br-p07	25	55	401519	Besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ? 
19358	br-p07	25	56	401532	Then we have informed a large_number of our crew that when they reach the United_States , they will be punished but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in_good_order . 
19359	br-p07	25	57	401571	Mr._Heiser , does this sound like a truly workable plan to you ? 
19360	br-p07	25	58	401584	Do you not think these men might choose the black_flag here_and_now '' ? 
19361	br-p07	26	59	401597	Wales said , `` Of_course they would . 
19362	br-p07	26	60	401605	They are about to do so at any moment as_it_is . 
19363	br-p07	26	61	401616	All that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead . 
19364	br-p07	26	62	401633	As_soon_as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from Spencer , we are going_to be rushed . 
19365	br-p07	26	63	401657	We are going_to be rushed and murdered '' . 
19366	br-p07	27	64	401666	`` That is extravagant language , Mr._Wales . 
19367	br-p07	27	65	401674	We are not going_to be rushed and murdered '' , Alexander said . 
19368	br-p07	27	66	401687	`` We are going_to bring the Somers into New_York harbor safe and sound '' . 
19369	br-p07	28	67	401702	`` Of_course , I agree with the Captain '' , Gansevoort said thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate . 
19370	br-p07	28	68	401725	The instinct of discipline has been lost . 
19371	br-p07	28	69	401733	Anything is possible when anarchy has the upper_hand '' . 
19372	br-p07	28	70	401743	He paused , then added , `` Everything on a ship is a weapon . 
19373	br-p07	28	71	401758	Implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no_matter where a man stands . 
19374	br-p07	28	72	401776	And we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many '' . 
19375	br-p07	29	73	401790	`` We ourselves must stand_sentinel '' . 
19376	br-p07	29	74	401797	Alexander said . 
19377	br-p07	29	75	401800	`` Under_arms day and night , watch and watch about . 
19378	br-p07	29	76	401811	Those of us present , the Perry brothers , Deslonde and the other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the Somers . 
19379	br-p07	29	77	401833	A great_deal of labor we have as_well , for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed '' . 
19380	br-p07	30	78	401854	And when he was alone again in the cabin , Alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in_the_end would be done . 
19381	br-p07	30	79	401890	With all his heart he had loved the Navy and now he must act in accordance with the Navy 's implacable laws . 
19382	br-p07	30	80	401913	And when he did , when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he knew he would lose forever the Navy to which he had dedicated his soul . 
19383	br-p07	31	81	401948	Where had he failed ? 
19384	br-p07	31	82	401953	How had he failed ? 
19385	br-p07	31	83	401958	He who had tried so hard , who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer . 
19386	br-p07	31	84	401976	It came_to him as he wept there aboard the Somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven . 
19387	br-p07	31	85	402005	It was given or it was not given . 
19388	br-p07	31	86	402014	One did one 's best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward . 
19389	br-p07	31	87	402029	One did one 's best and if fortune frowned , an eighteen year old boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard one 's ship . 
19390	br-p07	31	88	402055	And Alexander sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame . 
19391	br-p07	31	89	402074	God_knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an egotist 's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career . 
19392	br-p07	31	90	402107	Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist . 
19393	br-p07	31	91	402119	It was for love that he had served the Navy . 
19394	br-p07	31	92	402130	To have someday that love returned was what he had lived for . 
19395	br-p07	31	93	402143	Now the hope was gone . 
19396	br-p07	31	94	402149	Yes , he would bring the Somers safely into New_York harbor but at a price . 
19397	br-p07	31	95	402165	Dear_God , at what a price . 
19398	br-p07	32	96	402172	And after a while , he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity . 
19399	br-p07	32	97	402194	Stern faced , he inspected the prisoners , satisfying himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within_reason . 
19400	br-p07	32	98	402215	The prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger . 
19401	br-p07	32	99	402230	Only Cromwell , the giant boatswain , was mild-mannered and respectful . 
19402	br-p07	33	100	402242	He said , `` Captain , may I speak , please ? 
19403	br-p07	33	101	402254	Captain , I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' . 
19404	br-p07	34	102	402269	`` Are you , Cromwell '' ? 
19405	br-p07	35	103	402276	`` Yes , sir . 
19406	br-p07	35	104	402281	Before God I swear I am innocent . 
19407	br-p07	35	105	402289	I know nothing of any plot , if there is such a thing '' . 
19408	br-p07	36	106	402304	`` You are the only man aboard who can be in doubt '' . 
19409	br-p07	37	107	402318	`` I cannot speak_for others , sir , but I am innocent '' . 
19410	br-p07	37	108	402332	He leaned closer to Alexander , squinting up at him from the deck . 
19411	br-p07	37	109	402346	`` Surely , Captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything '' . 
19412	br-p07	38	110	402365	`` No , Cromwell , I did not find your name . 
19413	br-p07	38	111	402377	You were careful about that '' . 
19414	br-p07	39	112	402384	Now Spencer , seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy , spoke . 
19415	br-p07	39	113	402398	He said , `` Cromwell is telling you the truth . 
19416	br-p07	39	114	402409	He is innocent '' . 
19417	br-p07	40	115	402414	Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer . 
19418	br-p07	40	116	402421	The calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell . 
19419	br-p07	40	117	402447	Alexander knew Spencer too well to think him naive or thick-skulled . 
19420	br-p07	40	118	402459	And in a sudden wave of painful clarity , Alexander recognized a kinship with Spencer . 
19421	br-p07	40	119	402475	Here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable . 
19422	br-p07	40	120	402489	There was good_fortune and there was bad and Philip_Spencer , in handcuffs and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth . 
19423	br-p07	40	121	402512	He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune . 
19424	br-p07	40	122	402527	The red haired captain , towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with_sympathy upon Philip_Spencer . 
19425	br-p07	40	123	402554	This tragic lad had forged his own shackles . 
19426	br-p07	40	124	402563	But he could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him . 
19427	br-p07	40	125	402583	And because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red haired captain , they would be each other 's undoing . 
19428	br-p07	41	126	402605	`` Spencer , if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent ? 
19429	br-p07	41	127	402631	He was your constant companion '' . 
19430	br-p07	42	128	402638	The hazel eyes met Alexander 's . 
19431	br-p07	42	129	402645	`` I tell you he is innocent '' . 
19432	br-p07	43	130	402654	`` And do you think there is a reason why I should accept your word '' ? 
19433	br-p07	44	131	402671	`` Yes . 
19434	br-p07	44	132	402674	I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell '' . 
19435	br-p07	45	133	402684	`` Nothing to lose , either , Spencer '' . 
19436	br-p07	46	134	402694	`` That 's true '' , Spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation . 
19437	br-p07	46	135	402709	His eyes went_back to contemplation of the sea . 
19438	br-p07	47	136	402718	`` I am innocent , Captain '' , Cromwell said again . 
19439	br-p07	47	137	402730	`` Before God , Captain , I am innocent '' . 
19440	br-p07	48	138	402741	And though it was logical that a man who could plot mass_murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth , still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell . 
19441	br-p07	48	139	402774	The boatswain was as guilty as any . 
19442	br-p07	48	140	402782	No action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen , prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in Cromwell 's hands while Spencer whispered explanations . 
19443	br-p07	49	141	402819	`` I thought '' , Midshipman_Rogers had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry '' . 
19444	br-p07	50	142	402838	It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom , where a class of apprentices awaited him . 
19445	br-p07	50	143	402861	This was a training_ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which Alexander recognized . 
19446	br-p07	50	144	402884	Some of these apprentices were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were Spencer 's followers . 
19447	br-p09	1	1	402907	`` And I 'll take you with me '' . 
19448	br-p09	1	2	402917	The two of them against the world . 
19449	br-p09	1	3	402925	That had been how she imagined it . 
19450	br-p09	1	4	402933	For when he began to talk and dream all at_the_same_time , making his plans as he went , she had begun dreaming too . 
19451	br-p09	1	5	402957	But now the dream was over . 
19452	br-p09	1	6	402964	The big waking_up had happened . 
19453	br-p09	2	7	402970	`` What did I imagine '' ? she thought . 
19454	br-p09	2	8	402980	`` Did I see him about to swing low in a chariot ? 
19455	br-p09	2	9	402993	Or maybe poling up the south fork of the Forked_Deer_River braving the wastes dumped in it ? 
19456	br-p09	2	10	403010	Maybe I saw him on a barge with a gang of Ethiopians poling it '' . 
19457	br-p09	3	11	403026	And I 'll take you with me . 
19458	br-p09	3	12	403034	He had taken her all_right . 
19459	br-p09	3	13	403040	Wednesday nights after youth fellowship . 
19460	br-p09	3	14	403046	Out of the church and into his big car , it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist_courts , cabins really , with a cute naked light_bulb in the ceiling ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used_to play when you were a kid , where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs , watching in between your bouts at hopscotch ) , a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls , an insect Highway_Patrol with feelers waving . 
19461	br-p09	3	15	403166	And the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when Gratt went_out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened . 
19462	br-p09	4	16	403243	And Gratt_Shafer would be in Memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all_along . 
19463	br-p09	4	17	403273	Like Mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and Toonker_Burkette back in his office yanking out teeth , like they all knew he would . 
19464	br-p09	4	18	403300	Just like the balloon would go_up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to_hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen . 
19465	br-p09	4	19	403332	Or you could hope the parachute would n't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to Starkey_Poe in his suit of red underwear , but mainly because you were tired_of being an old_maid - a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go_on like everything is all_right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` I think I 'm pregnant '' . 
19466	br-p09	4	20	403425	You could wish that . 
19467	br-p09	4	21	403430	Or you could wish your daddy would really do it - kill Gratt_Shafer like he said when you all_the_time , all_along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night . 
19468	br-p09	4	22	403483	So you sit in the car and listen to the air run_out and listen to the rain and see the mud in_front_of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator_pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old_maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help . 
19469	br-p09	4	23	403598	And every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire_tool so you won n't tell , a combination like ham_and_eggs , rape her and kill her , and that is being an old_maid too . 
19470	br-p09	4	24	403653	It is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives_a_damn whether some tramp cracks your skull . 
19471	br-p09	4	25	403682	And most of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds , or owns seventeen oil_wells and six diamond mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one . 
19472	br-p09	4	26	403745	He can even be a mild voiced little town guy with big town ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even Houdini could n't figure_out , how it is unlocked . 
19473	br-p09	4	27	403777	And he can be on_the_way to Memphis , your Gratt_Shafer can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him - really want him - dead . 
19474	br-p09	4	28	403819	Because if you can n't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him . 
19475	br-p09	4	29	403836	For you do n't share him , not even with God . 
19476	br-p09	4	30	403848	If it is love , you do n't . 
19477	br-p09	5	31	403857	And I 'll take you with me . 
19478	br-p09	5	32	403865	Even if that 's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give , the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie . 
19479	br-p09	5	33	403929	Even when he is on_the_way to Memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you . 
19480	br-p09	5	34	403957	And in_a_way the promise works_out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart . 
19481	br-p09	5	35	403980	You feel him every mile further away . 
19482	br-p09	5	36	403988	You feel where he is and what he sees , and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she did n't particularly give_a_damn whether she got him or did n't . 
19483	br-p09	5	37	404044	And you know you will always wonder all_of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you did n't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think_of that other guy , the chump who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he could n't afford and the too shiny shoes . 
19484	br-p09	5	38	404114	You think : `` Did he feel that way about me '' ? 
19485	br-p09	5	39	404127	It comes_to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you could n't have Gratt_Shafer ; that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn_on or snap off when you got tired_of him , that other guy . 
19486	br-p09	5	40	404180	It dawns on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because Gratt_Shafer was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to Gratt_Shafer 's substitute , that other guy . 
19487	br-p09	5	41	404231	And you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened_out and moved to St._Louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success . 
19488	br-p09	5	42	404271	You wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks_of you . 
19489	br-p09	5	43	404284	You wonder about the Christmas_card with no name on it , and it comes_to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you could n't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted - to give them you . 
19490	br-p09	6	44	404334	`` Damn the world '' , she thought . 
19491	br-p09	6	45	404343	She looked out at the corn field , the great green deep acres of it rolled_out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed fence bordering the grounds . 
19492	br-p09	6	46	404373	The mayor envisioned factories there . 
19493	br-p09	6	47	404379	Homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart , while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments . 
19494	br-p09	6	48	404430	The bands were impatient , but they were the only ones . 
19495	br-p09	6	49	404442	The others , the ones in the stands , were spellbound , for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in New_York_City . 
19496	br-p09	6	50	404473	It was like being in the concert_hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing . 
19497	br-p09	6	51	404490	He was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all_over the United_States some_day . 
19498	br-p09	6	52	404511	So they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , feeling . 
19499	br-p09	6	53	404538	If a man was good , if he was going_to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go_on forever . 
19500	br-p09	6	54	404562	You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too . 
19501	br-p09	6	55	404587	It was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it . 
19502	br-p09	6	56	404603	You laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose_bumps rippled along your arm . 
19503	br-p09	6	57	404641	He hit the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second_thought . 
19504	br-p09	6	58	404666	While he talked you would n't trade being a West_Tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world , no_matter if it had n't , in six weeks , rained enough to wet_a_rat 's_ass . 
19505	br-p09	7	59	404703	She glanced at the man nodding beside her , a man with weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks , with powdery pale eyes reflecting all the droughts he had seen , reflecting the sky and the drought which must follow now in August - yes , with eyes predicting the drought and here it was only June , only festival time again and thoughts of Gratt_Shafer would not leave her . 
19506	br-p09	7	60	404775	`` I should have stayed at the store '' , she thought . 
19507	br-p09	8	61	404788	Back at the Factory-to-You with the other old_maids , back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four , which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions , like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat_down . 
19508	br-p09	8	62	404838	There was no lock because Herman did n't allow a lock . 
19509	br-p09	8	63	404850	A lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping . 
19510	br-p09	8	64	404861	The toilet had n't had a sincere scrubbing in years and there were things written on the walls of the little boxed_in place because you could n't keep the public out - entirely . 
19511	br-p09	8	65	404895	She could not count the times Herman had rapped on the door , just a_couple_of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might , someday , break_away the pipe connections from the wall . 
19512	br-p09	8	66	404930	The two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out , by the opposite door_handle which she would be clutching , whichever-the-hell clerk it was who thought she could waste so_much store time on the pot . 
19513	br-p09	9	67	404990	And the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on Saturdays and during sales , and there were no chairs and you could n't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or janitor . 
19514	br-p10	1	1	405032	Among us , we three handled quite a few small commissions , from spot drawings for advertising_agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs . 
19515	br-p10	1	2	405058	Each of us had his own specialty besides . 
19516	br-p10	1	3	405067	George did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a medieval miniature : hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight by ten sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler's_glass . 
19517	br-p10	1	4	405104	He also drew precise crisp spots , which he sold to various literary and artistic journals , The New_Yorker , for_instance , or Esquire . 
19518	br-p10	1	5	405129	I did book_jackets and covers for paperback reprints : naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , daring the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt_sleeves clutching a revolver . 
19519	br-p10	1	6	405168	The book could be The_Brothers_Karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration . 
19520	br-p10	1	7	405184	I remember once I did a jacket for Magpie_Press ; the book was a fine historical novel about Edward_3 , , and I did a week of research to get the details just_right : the fifteenth century armor , furnishings , clothes . 
19521	br-p10	1	8	405227	I even ferreted_out the materials from which shields were made - linden wood covered with leather - so I 'd get the light reflections accurate . 
19522	br-p10	1	9	405253	McKenzie , the art_editor , took one look at my finished sketch and said , `` Nothing_doing , Rufus . 
19523	br-p10	1	10	405273	In the first place , it 's static ; in the second place , it does n't look authentic ; and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to reproduce in_the_first_place - you 've got six colors there including gold '' . 
19524	br-p10	1	11	405318	I said , `` Mr._McKenzie , it is as authentic as careful research can make it '' . 
19525	br-p10	1	12	405336	He said , `` That may be , but it is n't authentic the way readers think . 
19526	br-p10	1	13	405354	They know from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle_ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like Little_Lord_Fauntleroy , and only the villains had beards . 
19527	br-p10	1	14	405383	And girls could n't have dressed like that - it is n't transparent enough '' . 
19528	br-p10	1	15	405399	In_the_end , I did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only I put a Lord_Byron shirt on the guy , gave him a sword instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie . 
19529	br-p10	1	16	405449	McKenzie was as happy_as_a_clam . 
19530	br-p10	1	17	405454	`` That 's authenticity '' , he said . 
19531	br-p10	2	18	405463	As for Donald , he actually sold paintings . 
19532	br-p10	2	19	405472	We all painted in our spare_time , and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it . 
19533	br-p10	2	20	405506	Not much ; he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to Joyce_Monmouth or her friends . 
19534	br-p10	2	21	405527	He had style , a real inner vision of his very own . 
19535	br-p10	2	22	405540	It was strange stuff - it reminded me of the pictures of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults . 
19536	br-p10	2	23	405574	There was the freshness of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of self-consciousness , but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye . 
19537	br-p10	2	24	405610	We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted . 
19538	br-p10	2	25	405628	It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it did n't prevent the paintings from being exciting . 
19539	br-p10	2	26	405660	He also had , at_times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker ; he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For_Christ's_sake , Donald , you 've got Prussian_blue all_over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all_over his pants as_well . 
19540	br-p10	2	27	405726	Mrs._Monmouth thought_of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting . 
19541	br-p10	2	28	405745	It was all gravy , and Donald did n't need much to live_on ; none of us did . 
19542	br-p10	2	29	405764	We shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another . 
19543	br-p10	3	30	405791	Attending the life_class was my idea - or rather , Askington 's idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two would n't have gone if I had n't talked them into it . 
19544	br-p10	3	31	405829	I wanted to paint again . 
19545	br-p10	3	32	405835	I had n't done a serious picture in almost a year . 
19546	br-p10	3	33	405847	It was n't just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself . 
19547	br-p10	3	34	405869	It was the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting . 
19548	br-p10	3	35	405895	I kept saying , `` If I could just build_up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get_to be well_known as an illustrator - like Peter_Askington , for_instance - then I could take some time_off and paint '' . 
19549	br-p10	3	36	405937	Askington was a kind of goal I set myself ; I had admired him long before I talked to him . 
19550	br-p10	3	37	405958	It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income . 
19551	br-p10	3	38	405988	The night we first met , at one of Mrs._Monmouth 's giant parties , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt ; instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade . 
19552	br-p10	3	39	406044	This set his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as_well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off 's rent for a year . 
19553	br-p10	3	40	406078	He was fifteen years older than I - forty four - but full of spring and sparkle . 
19554	br-p10	3	41	406096	He did n't look_like what I thought_of as an old_man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger . 
19555	br-p10	3	42	406119	He was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in America ; you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every_month . 
19556	br-p10	3	43	406151	Life had included him in its `` Modern American Artists '' series and had photographed him at his studio in the East_Sixties ; the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty of Spain . 
19557	br-p10	4	44	406200	I had a long talk with him . 
19558	br-p10	4	45	406208	We went_into Mrs._Monmouth 's library , which had low bookshelves all along the walls , and above them a Modigliani portrait , a Jackson_Pollock twelve feet long , and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background , that looked_like an inscription from a Martian tomb . 
19559	br-p10	4	46	406254	The fireplace had tiles made for Mrs._Monmouth by Picasso himself . 
19560	br-p10	4	47	406265	Like certain expensive restaurants , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself . 
19561	br-p10	5	48	406282	In the course of our talk , Askington mentioned that he spent part of each_week studying . 
19562	br-p10	5	49	406299	`` By yourself '' ? 
19563	br-p10	5	50	406304	I asked . 
19564	br-p10	5	51	406307	`` No , I take classes with different people '' , he said . 
19565	br-p10	5	52	406321	`` I do n't think I 've reached the point , yet , where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft . 
19566	br-p10	5	53	406349	Besides , it 's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters , as Durer went_to Italy to meet Bellini and Mantegna '' . 
19567	br-p10	6	54	406393	He made a circle with his thumb and fingers . 
19568	br-p10	6	55	406403	`` Painting is n't this big , you know . 
19569	br-p10	6	56	406413	It does n't embrace only the artist , alone before his easel . 
19570	br-p10	6	57	406426	It is as large as all_of art , interdependent , varied , multitudinous '' . 
19571	br-p10	6	58	406441	He threw his arms wide , his face shining . 
19572	br-p10	6	59	406451	`` The artist is like a fragment of a mosaic - no , he is more_than that , a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic . 
19573	br-p10	6	60	406477	One_of_these_days , I 'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that 's being painted these days , from extreme abstract_expressionism to extreme photorealism , and_then you 'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in_common with each other . 
19574	br-p10	6	61	406524	The eye is all , inward or outward . 
19575	br-p10	6	62	406533	Ah , what a title for the exhibition : The Eye is All '' ! 
19576	br-p10	7	63	406548	`` What do you study '' ? 
19577	br-p10	7	64	406555	I asked . 
19578	br-p10	7	65	406558	I was fascinated ; just listening to him made me feel intelligent . 
19579	br-p10	8	66	406571	`` I 'm studying anatomy with Burns '' , he replied . 
19580	br-p10	8	67	406583	`` Maybe you know him . 
19581	br-p10	8	68	406589	He teaches at the Manhattan_School_of_Art '' . 
19582	br-p10	8	69	406596	I nodded . 
19583	br-p10	8	70	406599	I had studied with Burns ten years before , during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave me , along with the five-hundred dollar prize for my paintings of bums on Hudson_Street . 
19584	br-p10	8	71	406631	Burns and I had not loved each other . 
19585	br-p10	8	72	406640	`` I 'm also studying enameling with Hajime_Iijima '' , he went_on , `` and twice a week I go_to a life_class taught by Pendleton '' . 
19586	br-p10	9	73	406667	`` Osric_Pendleton '' ? 
19587	br-p10	9	74	406671	I said . 
19588	br-p10	9	75	406674	`` My God , is he still alive ? 
19589	br-p10	9	76	406683	He must be a_million years old . 
19590	br-p10	9	77	406690	I went_to a retrospective of his work when I was eighteen , and I thought he was a contemporary of Cezanne 's '' . 
19591	br-p10	10	78	406714	`` Not quite '' . 
19592	br-p10	10	79	406719	Askington laughed . 
19593	br-p10	10	80	406722	`` He 's about sixty , now . 
19594	br-p10	10	81	406730	Still painting , still a kind of modern impressionist , beautiful canvases of mountains and farms . 
19595	br-p10	10	82	406747	He even makes the city look_like one of Thoreau 's hangouts . 
19596	br-p10	10	83	406759	I 've always admired him , and when I heard he was taking a_few pupils , I went to him and joined his class '' . 
19597	br-p10	11	84	406785	`` Yes , it sounds great '' , I said , `` but suppose you do n't think_of yourself as an impressionist painter '' ? 
19598	br-p10	12	85	406810	`` You 're missing the point '' , he said . 
19599	br-p10	12	86	406821	`` He has the magical eye . 
19600	br-p10	12	87	406828	And he is a great man . 
19601	br-p10	12	88	406835	Contact with him is stimulating . 
19602	br-p10	12	89	406841	And that 's the trouble with so many artists today . 
19603	br-p10	12	90	406852	They lack stimulation . 
19604	br-p10	12	91	406856	They sit alone in their rooms and try to paint , and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life . 
19605	br-p10	12	92	406878	That 's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation . 
19606	br-p10	12	93	406891	In the Middle_Ages , in the Renaissance , right up_to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world . 
19607	br-p10	12	94	406915	He was an artisan , a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood_carver did . 
19608	br-p10	12	95	406939	He filled a real need , showing society what it looked_like , turning it inside_out , portraying its wars and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauties , reflecting its profound religious impulses . 
19609	br-p10	12	96	406974	He was a propagandist - they were n't afraid of the word , then - satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party . 
19610	br-p10	12	97	407012	But look_at us today ! 
19611	br-p10	12	98	407017	We hold safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels , and most_of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity . 
19612	br-p10	12	99	407057	A bunch of amateur dervishes ! 
19613	br-p10	12	100	407063	What we need is to get_back to the group , to learning and apprenticeship , to the cafe and the school '' . 
19614	br-p10	13	101	407086	He could certainly talk . 
19615	br-p10	13	102	407091	The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton 's studio - or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he did n't work there himself - and joined the life_class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . 
19616	br-p10	13	103	407147	It was an awkward hour , but I did n't have to punch any time_clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a_couple_of hours later at the drawing_board to finish_up a job . 
19617	br-p10	13	104	407184	After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they would n't feel lonely , and we used_to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading `` out to work '' . 
19618	br-p10	13	105	407224	It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us . 
19619	br-p10	14	106	407242	In_a_way , Askington was right . 
19620	br-p10	14	107	407248	`` Stimulating '' was the word for it . 
19621	br-p10	14	108	407257	I do n't know that it was always as rewarding as I had expected it to be . 
19622	br-p10	14	109	407275	Partly , it was because Pendleton himself was n't what I anticipated . 
19623	br-p10	14	110	407288	I had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic , and he turned_out to be a rather bitter old_man who smelled of dead cigars . 
19624	br-p10	15	111	407316	No , that is n't quite fair . 
19625	br-p10	15	112	407324	Actually , there was a_lot of force in him , which is why I kept_on in that class instead of quitting after a week . 
19626	br-p12	1	1	407349	`` I had a rather small place of my own . 
19627	br-p12	1	2	407360	A nice bachelor apartment in a place called the Lancaster_Arms '' . 
19628	br-p12	2	3	407372	`` Uhhu '' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid . 
19629	br-p12	3	4	407388	`` And_then I had another place farther downtown I used as a studio '' . 
19630	br-p12	4	5	407403	`` Uhhu '' . 
19631	br-p12	5	6	407407	`` I 'm not a man who has many close intimate friends , Carla '' , he said , wanting her to know all about him . 
19632	br-p12	5	7	407434	`` Oh , I 'd drink with newspaper people . 
19633	br-p12	5	8	407444	I think I was what you might call a convivial man , and yet it was when I was alone in my studio , doing my work , that I really felt alive . 
19634	br-p12	5	9	407478	But I think a man needs at_least one intimate friend to communicate with '' . 
19635	br-p12	5	10	407493	Pausing , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question . 
19636	br-p12	5	11	407507	She showed no interest at_all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a_little . 
19637	br-p12	5	12	407527	`` Well , what about you , Carla '' ? 
19638	br-p12	6	13	407537	`` Me '' ? she asked , turning slowly . 
19639	br-p12	6	14	407547	`` What about me '' ? 
19640	br-p12	7	15	407553	`` Did you make friends easily '' ? 
19641	br-p12	8	16	407561	`` Umm , uhhu '' . 
19642	br-p12	9	17	407567	`` Somehow I imagine that as you grew_up you were alone a_lot . 
19643	br-p12	9	18	407580	How about it '' ? 
19644	br-p12	10	19	407585	`` I guess so '' , she said taking a Kleenex from her purse . 
19645	br-p12	10	20	407600	When she had wiped some of the lipstick from her mouth , she stared solemnly at her image in the mirror . 
19646	br-p12	11	21	407622	`` Are your people still alive '' ? he asked , trying to touch a part of her life Alberto had n't discussed ; so he could have something of her for himself . 
19647	br-p12	11	22	407656	`` You talk so well , Carla '' , he went_on . 
19648	br-p12	11	23	407668	`` You seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words '' , he added , trying to flatter her vanity . 
19649	br-p12	11	24	407695	`` You must have been good at history at school . 
19650	br-p12	11	25	407706	Where did you go_to school '' ? 
19651	br-p12	12	26	407713	`` What is this '' ? she asked , turning suddenly . 
19652	br-p12	12	27	407725	`` Do n't you know all about me by this time ? 
19653	br-p12	12	28	407737	My name 's Carla_Caneli . 
19654	br-p12	12	29	407742	This is my town . 
19655	br-p12	12	30	407747	I sleep_with you . 
19656	br-p12	12	31	407751	You know something more about me every_day , do n't you ? 
19657	br-p12	12	32	407763	Would you be happier if I made_up some stories about my life , told you some lies ? 
19658	br-p12	12	33	407781	Why are you trying to worry me '' ? 
19659	br-p12	13	34	407790	`` I 'm not trying to worry you '' . 
19660	br-p12	14	35	407800	`` Well , all_right then '' . 
19661	br-p12	15	36	407807	The cleansing tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got_up and picked_up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing . 
19662	br-p12	15	37	407840	At home he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had_to hide his annoyance . 
19663	br-p12	15	38	407858	Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance ? 
19664	br-p12	15	39	407870	he wondered . 
19665	br-p12	15	40	407873	Would he have_to clean_up after her every_day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get_down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang_up her dresses , pick_up her stockings , make the bed while she lay_around ? 
19666	br-p12	15	41	407915	He straightened_up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grew afraid . 
19667	br-p12	15	42	407928	If he dwelt on the indignities he suffered he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too . 
19668	br-p12	16	43	407958	`` What 's the_matter '' ? she asked suddenly . 
19669	br-p12	17	44	407968	`` Nothing . 
19670	br-p12	17	45	407971	Nothing at_all '' , he said quietly . 
19671	br-p12	17	46	407979	`` Let 's go_out '' . 
19672	br-p12	18	47	407985	`` Are those the only shoes you have , Sam '' ? 
19673	br-p12	19	48	407997	`` What 's the_matter with them '' ? 
19674	br-p12	20	49	408005	`` The heavy thick soles . 
19675	br-p12	20	50	408011	Look at them '' . 
19676	br-p12	21	51	408016	`` They 're an expensive English shoe for walking_around a_lot . 
19677	br-p12	21	52	408027	I like them '' . 
19678	br-p12	22	53	408032	`` Sam , no one around here wears such heavy soles . 
19679	br-p12	22	54	408044	Ca n't you get another pair '' ? 
19680	br-p12	23	55	408052	`` Maybe I could '' , he said , surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him . 
19681	br-p12	23	56	408074	`` I 'll get an elegant pair of thin soled Italian shoes tomorrow , Carla '' . 
19682	br-p12	24	57	408091	`` And I do n't know why you want to go_on wearing that outfit '' , she said , making a face . 
19683	br-p12	25	58	408114	`` What 's the_matter with it '' ? 
19684	br-p12	25	59	408122	He had put_on the gray jacket and the dark gray slacks and the fawn colored shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he had encountered her on the street . 
19685	br-p12	26	60	408155	`` Oh , Sam . 
19686	br-p12	26	61	408160	You look_like a tweedy Englishman . 
19687	br-p12	26	62	408166	Ca n't you wear something else and look a_little more as though you belonged '' ? 
19688	br-p12	27	63	408182	`` I do n't mind at_all '' , he said , delighted with her attention . 
19689	br-p12	27	64	408198	Changing his clothes , he put_on his dark-blue flannel suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for_good . 
19690	br-p12	27	65	408227	But it was a hopeful sign , he told himself . 
19691	br-p12	27	66	408238	She no_longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in Parioli . 
19692	br-p12	28	67	408259	That day they loafed around , just getting the feel of the city . 
19693	br-p12	28	68	408273	They looked at the ruins of the old Roman wall on the lower Via_Veneto , then they went_to the Farnese_Gardens . 
19694	br-p12	28	69	408294	She had some amusing scandal about the Farneses in the old days . 
19695	br-p12	28	70	408307	Then they took a taxi to Trastevere . 
19696	br-p12	28	71	408315	`` There 's a church you should see '' , she said . 
19697	br-p12	28	72	408328	And when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at Santa_Maria he had_to keep a straight_face , not letting_on he had been there with Alberto . 
19698	br-p12	28	73	408356	He let her tell him all about the church . 
19699	br-p12	28	74	408366	Then they had dinner . 
19700	br-p12	28	75	408371	All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself . 
19701	br-p12	28	76	408381	When they got home at midnight she was tired_out . 
19702	br-p12	28	77	408391	And in the morning when he woke_up at ten the church_bells were ringing . 
19703	br-p12	29	78	408405	He had never heard so many bells , and as he lay there listening , he thought_of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the Spanish_Steps . 
19704	br-p12	29	79	408446	It was a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought . 
19705	br-p12	29	80	408461	She might like to take him to St._Peter 's . 
19706	br-p12	30	81	408471	`` Carla , wake_up '' , he said shaking her . 
19707	br-p12	30	82	408482	`` It 's ten o_'_clock . 
19708	br-p12	30	83	408488	Are n't you going_out to mass ? 
19709	br-p12	30	84	408495	You could take me to St._Peter 's '' . 
19710	br-p12	31	85	408504	`` Uhhu '' , she muttered . 
19711	br-p12	32	86	408511	`` Come_on , you 'll be late '' . 
19712	br-p12	33	87	408520	`` I think I 'll sleep_in this morning '' , she said drowsily , and as she snuggled against him , he wondered if she ever went_to church . 
19713	br-p12	33	88	408549	Why did he want her to go_to church ? 
19714	br-p12	33	89	408558	he wondered . 
19715	br-p12	33	90	408561	Probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security . 
19716	br-p12	33	91	408578	It would be good for her . 
19717	br-p12	33	92	408585	It was too_bad he had no feeling himself for church . 
19718	br-p12	33	93	408596	Not his poor mother 's fault . 
19719	br-p12	33	94	408603	She would have been better_off if she had stuck_to her Bible . 
19720	br-p12	33	95	408615	As for himself , he just did n't have the temperament for it . 
19721	br-p12	33	96	408629	From the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know . 
19722	br-p12	33	97	408659	Then he thought_of those Old_Testament figures on the ceiling of the Sistine_Chapel . 
19723	br-p12	33	98	408672	Just figures out of a tribal folklore . 
19724	br-p12	33	99	408680	Could he honestly believe it would be good for Carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now ? 
19725	br-p12	33	100	408700	Being a woman though , she would take only what she needed from church . 
19726	br-p12	33	101	408715	It was too_bad he was n't a Catholic himself . 
19727	br-p12	33	102	408725	Or a Protestant , or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists , or a strict orthodox Communist . 
19728	br-p12	33	103	408743	What was the_matter with him that they all wearied him ? 
19729	br-p12	33	104	408754	It was the times , he was sure . 
19730	br-p12	33	105	408763	All the ideologies changing from day to day , right under his eyes , so how could a man look_to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom ? 
19731	br-p12	33	106	408794	It was all_too wearying . 
19732	br-p12	33	107	408799	Look somewhere else . 
19733	br-p12	33	108	408803	But where ? 
19734	br-p12	33	109	408806	Just_the_same , he thought , pondering over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like Carla if she got_up and went_to church . 
19735	br-p12	34	110	408833	A half_hour later he got her up to go_out for breakfast so the Ferraros , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going_to a late mass . 
19736	br-p12	34	111	408864	It seemed to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla . 
19737	br-p12	35	112	408894	`` Since we 're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I 'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every_day to clean for us '' . 
19738	br-p12	35	113	408932	And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam . 
19739	br-p12	35	114	408952	There 's so little to do '' . 
19740	br-p12	36	115	408960	`` Why not '' ? she said . 
19741	br-p12	36	116	408968	`` I 'm not good at that kind of thing '' . 
19742	br-p12	37	117	408980	`` This afternoon let 's take an air with them . 
19743	br-p12	37	118	408991	Let 's be fine superior people of great dignity '' , he said as if he were joking . 
19744	br-p12	38	119	409010	`` If you find it necessary , Sam , go_ahead '' , she said , turning on the stair . 
19745	br-p12	38	120	409030	`` I am what I am . 
19746	br-p12	38	121	409037	I can n't help it '' . 
19747	br-p12	38	122	409044	Her words remained with him , worrying him for hours . 
19748	br-p12	38	123	409055	He did n't know how she would behave with other people . 
19749	br-p12	39	124	409067	When they walked into the Ferraro apartment , the old lady , bowing and smiling , said softly . 
19750	br-p12	39	125	409086	`` Ciao , '' and put_out her hand . 
19751	br-p12	39	126	409095	Her little brown face wrinkled up , her brown eyes gleamed , and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things . 
19752	br-p12	39	127	409119	Agnese , smiling too , said , `` ' Ello '' , and_then more slowly , `` I am happy '' . 
19753	br-p12	39	128	409141	And they sat_down and began their little coffee party . 
19754	br-p12	39	129	409151	The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee . 
19755	br-p12	39	130	409160	Acting only as interpreter Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal . 
19756	br-p12	39	131	409177	She would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again . 
19757	br-p12	39	132	409192	Watching her , he felt like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back_and_forth . 
19758	br-p12	39	133	409212	Signora_Ferraro , bobbing her head encouragingly , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest . 
19759	br-p12	39	134	409229	Carla translated . 
19760	br-p12	39	135	409232	The old_woman had a nephew from North_Italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired_of the seasonal unemployment , and who had migrated to Canada to work_on the railway . 
19761	br-p12	39	136	409266	For a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar . 
19762	br-p12	39	137	409280	Did many_of Sam 's countrymen live in boxcars in the bush ? 
19763	br-p12	39	138	409292	Had Sam ever lived in a boxcar ? 
19764	br-p12	39	139	409300	she wanted to know . 
19765	br-p12	39	140	409305	Regretfully Sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars . 
19766	br-p12	39	141	409316	Just_the_same , the old_woman said , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country . 
19767	br-p12	39	142	409345	And Sam thanked her , and hoped he might meet her nephew back home , and asked her if she had any further news of the Pope . 
19768	br-p12	40	143	409373	A very great Pope , this one , the old_woman explained , her black eyes sparkling . 
19769	br-p12	40	144	409390	An intellectual . 
19770	br-p12	40	145	409393	But very mystical too . 
19771	br-p12	40	146	409398	It was said that he had had a vision . 
19772	br-p12	40	147	409408	Just_as thousands that day in Portugal had seen the sun dancing in the sky , he had seen the same thing later in his own garden , and she turned_to Agnese for confirmation . 
19773	br-p12	40	148	409442	Agnese had been sitting quietly , listening with the serenity of the unaware . 
19774	br-p12	40	149	409456	Now a little flush came_on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes . 
19775	br-p12	40	150	409471	The Holy_Father would die soon , she said to Carla , so she could translate for Sam , although he had a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world . 
19776	br-p12	40	151	409516	Yes , the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint . 
19777	br-p12	40	152	409529	No , he was indeed a saint now . 
19778	br-p12	40	153	409538	Nodding approvingly and swelling with importance , the old lady whispered confidentially . 
19779	br-p12	40	154	409551	There was a certain discontent among the cardinals . 
19780	br-p12	40	155	409560	The Pope , in the splendor of his great intellect , had neglected them a_little . 
19781	br-p12	40	156	409576	There would be changes made , and Signor_Raymond should understand that when the Pope died it was like the end of a regime in Rome . 
19782	br-p12	40	157	409602	Jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent . 
19783	br-p12	41	158	409613	Did Signor_Raymond understand ? 
19784	br-p12	41	159	409617	Indeed he did , Sam said solemnly , trying to get Carla 's eye . 
19785	br-p12	41	160	409632	Surely she could see that these women were her Italians , too , he thought . 
19786	br-p12	41	161	409648	Devout , orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in Brooklyn or Malta or Ireland . 
19787	br-p12	41	162	409666	But Carla ; eyes were on Agnese whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness . 
19788	br-p12	41	163	409688	And Carla , watching in wonder , turned_to Sam . 
19789	br-p12	41	164	409698	`` It means so much to her . 
19790	br-p12	41	165	409706	It 's like a flame , I guess '' , she said in a dreamy tone . 
19791	br-p24	1	1	409723	There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot . 
19792	br-p24	1	2	409739	The new Riverside pitcher turned_out to have an overhand fast_ball that took a hop . 
19793	br-p24	1	3	409754	For a_few innings the Anniston team could n't figure him out . 
19794	br-p24	1	4	409766	Then , in the fifth , Anniston 's kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center_field . 
19795	br-p24	1	5	409788	Eddie_Lee , Riverside 's redheaded playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him . 
19796	br-p24	1	6	409806	Phil_Rossoff cut over to center from left_field to get the relay . 
19797	br-p24	1	7	409818	Eddie caught_up_with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil . 
19798	br-p24	1	8	409831	`` Third ! 
19799	br-p24	1	9	409834	Third_base '' ! 
19800	br-p24	1	10	409837	Eddie shouted . 
19801	br-p24	1	11	409840	Phil spun_around and made an accurate throw into Mike_Deegan 's hands on third_base . 
19802	br-p24	1	12	409854	Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag . 
19803	br-p24	1	13	409867	But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late . 
19804	br-p24	1	14	409878	He came into the bag with his body and Mike_Deegan brought the ball down full in his face . 
19805	br-p24	1	15	409897	`` You bastard '' ! the Anniston catcher screamed . 
19806	br-p24	1	16	409907	He jumped_to_his_feet and started to throw punches . 
19807	br-p24	1	17	409915	Mike_Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher . 
19808	br-p24	1	18	409928	This brought in everybody from both sides , while the spectators stood_up and added to the uproar . 
19809	br-p24	1	19	409946	The fighters were separated in a_few minutes . 
19810	br-p24	1	20	409954	The game was resumed . 
19811	br-p24	1	21	409959	But Mike_Deegan was boiling mad now . 
19812	br-p24	1	22	409966	When the inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all_the_way into the dugout . 
19813	br-p24	1	23	409981	Phil_Rossoff , coming_in from left_field , stopped at the water_fountain for a drink . 
19814	br-p24	1	24	409995	Mike_Deegan was standing beside it , facing the field . 
19815	br-p24	1	25	410005	He was eyeing the Anniston catcher warming_up his pitcher before the inning began . 
19816	br-p24	1	26	410019	`` Keep your eyes open , sonny '' ! 
19817	br-p24	1	27	410028	Mike yelled to the catcher . 
19818	br-p24	1	28	410034	`` You 're in_for trouble '' . 
19819	br-p24	1	29	410041	The Anniston catcher did not reply with words . 
19820	br-p24	1	30	410050	He simply turned_to Mike and smiled . 
19821	br-p24	1	31	410057	This so infuriated Deegan that he spun_around and said : `` I 'll get that little bastard . 
19822	br-p24	1	32	410075	So_help_me_God , I 'll get him '' . 
19823	br-p24	2	33	410083	Phil_Rossoff said : `` Why do n't you leave him alone '' ? 
19824	br-p24	3	34	410096	`` Mind your own goddamn business '' , Mike_Deegan said . 
19825	br-p24	4	35	410107	Phil shrugged . 
19826	br-p24	4	36	410110	He stepped into the dugout , wondering why Deegan was always looking_for trouble . 
19827	br-p24	4	37	410124	Maybe the answer was in his eyes . 
19828	br-p24	4	38	410132	When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit_in with his lips . 
19829	br-p24	5	39	410143	In the last of the sixth inning Mike_Deegan got_up to bat and hit a fast_ball over the left_fielder 's head . 
19830	br-p24	5	40	410164	By the time the fielder got his hands on the ball Deegan was rounding third_base and heading for home . 
19831	br-p24	5	41	410184	The left_fielder threw and it was a good one . 
19832	br-p24	5	42	410194	But Mike had no chance of being tagged . 
19833	br-p24	5	43	410203	The Anniston catcher was straddling home_plate . 
19834	br-p24	5	44	410210	All Deegan had_to do was slide , fall_away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher . 
19835	br-p24	6	45	410228	Both fell heavily to the ground . 
19836	br-p24	7	46	410235	Only Mike got to his feet . 
19837	br-p24	7	47	410242	He went_back to touch home_plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking_back . 
19838	br-p24	8	48	410257	The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the field . 
19839	br-p24	8	49	410269	They poured water over their catcher 's face . 
19840	br-p24	8	50	410278	He did not move . 
19841	br-p24	8	51	410283	Then the manager called_for a doctor . 
19842	br-p24	8	52	410290	The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer . 
19843	br-p24	8	53	410302	Then , quickly , and a_little nervously , the doctor ordered a_couple_of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing_room . 
19844	br-p24	9	54	410323	Mike_Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching . 
19845	br-p24	9	55	410332	When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` That ought to teach the sonofabitch '' . 
19846	br-p24	10	56	410355	Phil_Rossoff , seated next to Deegan , got_up and moved to the other end of the bench . 
19847	br-p24	11	57	410373	The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout . 
19848	br-p24	11	58	410384	He was followed by four of his men . 
19849	br-p24	11	59	410393	It began to look as if something was going_to happen . 
19850	br-p24	11	60	410404	Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer . 
19851	br-p24	11	61	410413	Eddie_Lee moved over to Mike_Deegan 's side . 
19852	br-p24	11	62	410421	No one said a word . 
19853	br-p24	12	63	410427	The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in_front of Mike . 
19854	br-p24	12	64	410440	His face was flushed . 
19855	br-p24	13	65	410445	`` Deegan '' , the manager said , his voice pitched low , quivering . 
19856	br-p24	13	66	410460	`` That was a rotten thing to do '' . 
19857	br-p24	14	67	410470	`` For God 's sake '' , Mike said , waving the manager away . 
19858	br-p24	14	68	410485	`` Stop it , will you ? 
19859	br-p24	14	69	410492	Tell your guys not to block the plate '' . 
19860	br-p24	15	70	410502	`` You did n't have_to ram him '' . 
19861	br-p24	16	71	410511	`` That 's what you say '' . 
19862	br-p24	17	72	410519	The Anniston manager looked at Eddie_Lee . 
19863	br-p24	17	73	410526	It was a cold and calculated look . 
19864	br-p24	17	74	410534	He turned and went_back across the field to his dugout . 
19865	br-p24	17	75	410545	He called_in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston . 
19866	br-p24	18	76	410572	The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike_Deegan came up to bat . 
19867	br-p24	18	77	410587	Everyone in the ball_park seemed to be standing and shouting . 
19868	br-p24	19	78	410598	The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike 's head . 
19869	br-p24	19	79	410612	Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him . 
19870	br-p24	19	80	410624	He arose slowly and brushed himself off . 
19871	br-p24	19	81	410632	He got back into the batter's_box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again . 
19872	br-p24	20	82	410649	`` Hit the bum '' ! somebody yelled from the Anniston bench . 
19873	br-p24	21	83	410662	In the Riverside dugout Frankie_Ricco , shortstop , whispered into Phil 's ear : `` There 's gonna be a fight '' . 
19874	br-p24	22	84	410685	`` Look at those bastards '' ! 
19875	br-p24	22	85	410692	Charlie_Haydon , a pitcher , said . 
19876	br-p24	22	86	410699	`` They 're looking_for trouble '' . 
19877	br-p24	23	87	410706	Mike was slow getting into the box this time . 
19878	br-p24	23	88	410716	When he finally did he had_to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came_in . 
19879	br-p24	24	89	410732	`` Listen '' ! he shouted to the pitcher . 
19880	br-p24	24	90	410742	`` One more and I 'm coming out there '' ! 
19881	br-p24	25	91	410753	`` I 'll be waiting '' ! the pitcher yelled back . 
19882	br-p24	26	92	410765	Mike_Deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat . 
19883	br-p24	26	93	410777	He stood flat-footed in the box , but not very close to the plate now . 
19884	br-p24	26	94	410793	The pitcher wound_up and the ball came in straight for Mike 's head . 
19885	br-p24	26	95	410807	Deegan dropped , got_up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the mound . 
19886	br-p24	26	96	410835	The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards Mike_Deegan . 
19887	br-p24	26	97	410846	They were both walking towards each other , unhurried . 
19888	br-p24	27	98	410856	Riverside and Anniston players rushed_out on the field . 
19889	br-p24	27	99	410865	In the next moment , it seemed , the infield was crowded with spectators , ballplayers , cops , kids and a dog . 
19890	br-p24	27	100	410889	There was much shouting and screaming . 
19891	br-p24	27	101	410896	Fights sprang_up and were quickly squelched . 
19892	br-p24	27	102	410903	Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled_away before they even came together . 
19893	br-p24	28	103	410916	Phil_Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started . 
19894	br-p24	29	104	410934	After the game , Phil was taking_off his sweatshirt in the dressing_room when Mike_Deegan came_in . 
19895	br-p24	30	105	410950	`` It 's a helluva thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a guy 's own team-mate won n't come_out and help him in a fight '' . 
19896	br-p24	31	106	410983	Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head . 
19897	br-p24	31	107	410994	Frankie_Ricco sat_down on the bench near Phil . 
19898	br-p24	31	108	411002	The other players were undressing quietly . 
19899	br-p24	31	109	411009	Eddie_Lee had not come_in yet . 
19900	br-p24	32	110	411015	Mike went over to Phil and stood over him . 
19901	br-p24	32	111	411025	`` Why the hell did n't you come_out when you saw them gang_up on me '' ? 
19902	br-p24	33	112	411042	`` I did n't think it was necessary '' . 
19903	br-p24	34	113	411052	`` Well ! 
19904	br-p24	34	114	411055	Now that 's just fine ! 
19905	br-p24	34	115	411061	You did n't think it was necessary '' . 
19906	br-p24	34	116	411070	Mike placed both his hands on his hips . 
19907	br-p24	34	117	411079	He pushed his jaw forward . 
19908	br-p24	34	118	411085	`` Listen , wise_guy , if you think I 'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball_club you 're crazy '' . 
19909	br-p24	35	119	411108	Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had_to look up into Mike 's face . 
19910	br-p24	36	120	411126	`` I did n't ask you to fight for the ball_club '' , Phil said slowly . 
19911	br-p24	36	121	411143	`` Nobody else did , either '' . 
19912	br-p24	37	122	411151	`` You trying to say I started the fight '' ? 
19913	br-p24	38	123	411162	`` I 'm not trying to say anything '' . 
19914	br-p24	39	124	411172	Phil turned_away and opened his locker , and_then he heard Mike_Deegan say : `` You 're yellow , Rossoff '' ! 
19915	br-p24	39	125	411193	and Phil banged his locker door shut and spun_around . 
19916	br-p24	39	126	411203	But before anything could happen Frankie_Ricco was between them and Eddie_Lee had come into the dressing_room . 
19917	br-p24	40	127	411220	`` Phil , come into my office '' , Eddie said . 
19918	br-p24	41	128	411232	Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door . 
19919	br-p24	41	129	411243	He sat_down before Eddie 's desk . 
19920	br-p24	42	130	411250	`` I 'm doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly . 
19921	br-p24	42	131	411263	`` You get your unconditional release as of today '' . 
19922	br-p24	43	132	411274	Phil 's eyes widened just a_trifle . 
19923	br-p24	44	133	411281	`` The best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go_home . 
19924	br-p24	44	134	411298	You do n't belong in professional baseball '' . 
19925	br-p24	45	135	411307	Phil had_to clear his throat . 
19926	br-p24	45	136	411313	`` Is this because of what happened out there '' ? 
19927	br-p24	46	137	411324	`` No '' , Eddie said . 
19928	br-p24	46	138	411331	`` But it does confirm what I 've suspected all_along '' . 
19929	br-p24	47	139	411343	Phil stood_up . 
19930	br-p24	47	140	411346	`` Listen ! 
19931	br-p24	47	141	411349	This is the second time '' . 
19932	br-p24	48	142	411356	`` Sit_down , sit_down '' , Eddie said . 
19933	br-p24	48	143	411365	`` I 'm not saying you 're yellow . 
19934	br-p24	48	144	411374	I am saying you 're not a professional ballplayer '' . 
19935	br-p24	49	145	411385	Eddie_Lee leaned forward over the desk . 
19936	br-p24	49	146	411392	`` Now listen to me , Phil . 
19937	br-p24	49	147	411400	I 'm not steering you wrong . 
19938	br-p24	49	148	411407	You have n't got the heart for baseball '' . 
19939	br-p24	50	149	411417	Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned . 
19940	br-p24	50	150	411425	Suddenly his voice grew hard . 
19941	br-p24	50	151	411431	`` What the hell do you think baseball is ? 
19942	br-p24	50	152	411441	You 're not in the big_leagues , but if you can n't give_and_take down here what the hell do you think it 'll be like up there '' ? 
19943	br-p24	51	153	411470	Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short . 
19944	br-p24	51	154	411481	`` Now do n't tell me what a good ball_player you are . 
19945	br-p24	51	155	411494	I know you 've got talent . 
19946	br-p24	51	156	411501	But what you have n't got is the heart to back_up that talent with . 
19947	br-p24	51	157	411516	The heart , Phil . 
19948	br-p24	51	158	411521	You just have n't got the heart for pro-ball , and that 's it '' . 
19949	br-p24	52	159	411537	Dazed , Phil said : `` I do n't get_it . 
19950	br-p24	52	160	411548	My batting_average & & & '' . 
19951	br-p24	53	161	411555	Eddie stood_up abruptly , then sat_down just as abruptly . 
19952	br-p24	53	162	411565	`` What difference does your batting_average make ? 
19953	br-p24	53	163	411573	Or your fielding_average . 
19954	br-p24	53	164	411577	Or even the way you run_bases . 
19955	br-p24	53	165	411584	I tell you when it 's necessary to hurt in_order to win - you won n't do it . 
19956	br-p24	53	166	411603	That 's what I mean by no heart for the game . 
19957	br-p24	53	167	411615	Baseball 's no cinch . 
19958	br-p24	53	168	411620	Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there . 
19959	br-p24	53	169	411631	He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out_of_commission that 's one less who might take his job away later_on . 
19960	br-p24	53	170	411655	What the hell do you think baseball is ? 
19961	br-p24	53	171	411664	A sport ? 
19962	br-p24	53	172	411667	It 's a way_of_life , goddamit ! 
19963	br-p24	53	173	411674	And you 've got to be ready to cut_to_ribbons anybody who want to take your way_of_life away from you '' ! 
19964	br-p24	54	174	411695	He 's wrong ! 
19965	br-p24	54	175	411699	Phil thought . 
19966	br-p24	54	176	411702	It 's only his opinion . 
19967	br-p24	54	177	411708	There were other clubs in this league . 
19968	br-p24	54	178	411716	He stood_up slowly . 
19969	br-p24	54	179	411720	He was a_little pale and shaky . 
19970	br-p24	54	180	411727	His lips felt glued together . 
19971	br-p24	55	181	411733	`` I think you 're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally . 
19972	br-p24	56	182	411747	Eddie nodded . 
19973	br-p24	56	183	411750	`` Okay . 
19974	br-p24	56	184	411753	You 'll get your pay in the morning '' . 
19975	br-p24	57	185	411763	Phil turned and left the room , hearing Eddie say : 
19976	br-p24	57	186	411774	`` Someday you 'll see I was right '' . 
19977	br-p24	58	187	411784	Phil shut the door behind him . 
19978	br-p24	58	188	411791	Outside in the dressing_room , Frankie_Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street_clothes . 
19979	br-p24	59	189	411806	`` What happened '' ? 
19980	br-p24	59	190	411811	Frankie asked . 
19981	br-p24	60	191	411814	Phil said : `` I got my release '' . 
19982	br-p24	61	192	411824	`` You crazy '' ? 
19983	br-p24	62	193	411829	Phil shrugged . 
19984	br-p24	63	194	411832	`` What for '' ? 
19985	br-p24	64	195	411837	Phil sighed . 
19986	br-p24	65	196	411840	Frankie shook his head . 
19987	br-p24	65	197	411845	`` I do n't get_it '' . 
19988	br-p24	66	198	411852	`` I do n't know '' , Phil said . 
19989	br-p24	67	199	411862	They were silent for a_few moments . 
19990	br-p24	67	200	411869	Then Frankie said : `` What are you gonna do '' ? 
19991	br-p24	68	201	411881	Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat_down on the bench again . 
19992	br-p24	68	202	411896	Phil took_off one shoe and stared at it . 
19993	br-p24	69	203	411905	`` Do n't take it like this '' , Frankie said . 
19994	br-p24	69	204	411917	`` Hell , plenty of guys get let_out and come_back later . 
19995	br-p24	69	205	411929	The leagues are full of guys like that '' . 
19996	br-p24	70	206	411939	Phil was very quiet . 
19997	br-p24	71	207	411944	`` What are you gonna do , Phil '' ? 
19998	br-p24	72	208	411954	Phil did not answer . 
19999	br-p24	73	209	411959	`` Why not try another club '' ? 
20000	br-p24	74	210	411967	Phil looked up . 
20001	br-p24	74	211	411971	What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that ? 
20002	br-p24	75	212	411984	`` Springfield 's in tomorrow '' , Frankie said . 
20003	br-p24	75	213	411994	`` Talk to Whitey_Jackson '' . 
20004	br-p24	76	214	412000	He just did n't know what he was talking_about , saying a thing like that . 
20005	br-p24	77	215	412016	`` Will you do it , Phil '' ? 
20006	br-p24	78	216	412025	`` Do what '' ? 
20007	br-p24	79	217	412030	`` Ask Whitey for a job '' . 
20008	br-p24	80	218	412038	Phil nodded . 
20009	br-p24	80	219	412041	`` Sure '' , he said . 
20010	br-p24	80	220	412048	`` Springfield come_in tomorrow '' ? 
20011	br-p24	81	221	412054	Frankie nodded . 
20012	br-p24	82	222	412057	`` I 'll speak_to Whitey '' . 
20013	br-p24	83	223	412064	`` Atta_boy '' . 
20014	br-p24	84	224	412068	`` I 'll talk to him , all_right '' . 
20015	br-p24	85	225	412078	`` Do n't worry '' , Frankie said . 
20016	br-p24	85	226	412087	`` You 'll get a job there . 
20017	br-p24	85	227	412095	He needs outfielders bad '' . 
20018	br-p24	86	228	412101	`` I 'm not worried about it '' , Phil said . 
20019	br-p24	87	229	412113	`` That 's the way to talk . 
20020	br-p24	87	230	412121	What else did Eddie have to say '' ? 
20021	br-p24	88	231	412130	`` Nothing '' , Phil said . 
20022	br-r04	1	1	412137	Up_to_date , however , his garden was still more_or_less of a mess , he had n't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he had n't found it . 
20023	br-r04	2	2	412173	It was n't his fault that these things were so . 
20024	br-r04	2	3	412184	The difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned_up immediately . 
20025	br-r04	3	4	412203	As a result , life had become a kind of continuous make-ready . 
20026	br-r04	3	5	412216	Once he disposed_of these items which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted . 
20027	br-r04	3	6	412237	Then , at_last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs . 
20028	br-r04	4	7	412275	His dogs ? 
20029	br-r04	4	8	412278	He had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams . 
20030	br-r04	4	9	412297	Then they had always been romping around him on these walks , yelping with delight , dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting_expeditions , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws . 
20031	br-r04	4	10	412333	Dogs did something to one 's ego . 
20032	br-r04	4	11	412341	They were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world 's great guys . 
20033	br-r04	4	12	412357	Regardless_of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find_out - and even if they did it would make no difference . 
20034	br-r04	5	13	412389	Now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture . 
20035	br-r04	5	14	412405	What in the world were you going to do with a_lot_of dogs when you left for town on Monday afternoons ? 
20036	br-r04	5	15	412426	You certainly could n't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every_week they would become so confused that they would have nervous_breakdowns . 
20037	br-r04	5	16	412461	Why in the world could n't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ? 
20038	br-r04	6	17	412479	It worried him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day . 
20039	br-r04	6	18	412498	He would wake_up in_the_middle of the night and fret about it . 
20040	br-r04	6	19	412510	How in the world had he formerly found time to build_up a business , raise a family , be on half_a_dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go_out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief_case ? 
20041	br-r04	7	20	412553	Was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ? 
20042	br-r04	7	21	412567	Could it be that it speeded_up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get_it_over_with ? 
20043	br-r04	7	22	412598	Or was the answer less metaphysical ? 
20044	br-r04	7	23	412605	Did older people work more slowly ? 
20045	br-r04	7	24	412612	Did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean_out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? 
20046	br-r04	7	25	412641	Did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let_go ? 
20047	br-r04	8	26	412658	It might be that certain people were_born with a compulsion to complicate their lives , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizards in the sun , too indolent to blink their eyes . 
20048	br-r04	8	27	412695	Perhaps it was his misfortune , or good_fortune , whichever way one looked_at it , to belong_to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build_up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to_it . 
20049	br-r04	9	28	412737	And then_again perhaps the reason why he could n't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go_by , was because he did n't want to do them . 
20050	br-r04	9	29	412788	There was no compulsion behind them . 
20051	br-r04	9	30	412795	They could be done or left undone and nobody really gave_a_damn . 
20052	br-r04	9	31	412807	During all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done . 
20053	br-r04	9	32	412823	This habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no_one was waiting . 
20054	br-r04	10	33	412845	He looked at the luminous dial of his wrist_watch . 
20055	br-r04	10	34	412855	It was five minutes after four . 
20056	br-r04	10	35	412862	On some distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered . 
20057	br-r04	10	36	412880	He turned_over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn . 
20058	br-r04	11	37	412898	At_least he could buy the equipment for his workshop . 
20059	br-r04	11	38	412908	Thus committed , action might follow . 
20060	br-r04	11	39	412915	He went down to Mills_and_Bradley 's Hardware_Store and bought a full set of carpenter 's tools , including a rotary power_saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr._Mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling , whatever they were . 
20061	br-r04	11	40	412957	He also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging_up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , sandpaper and glue and assorted nails , levels and T_squares and plumb_lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for . 
20062	br-r04	12	41	413005	`` There '' , said Mr._Mills . 
20063	br-r04	12	42	413012	`` That 'll get you started . 
20064	br-r04	12	43	413019	Best not to get everything at_once . 
20065	br-r04	12	44	413026	Add things as you find you need ' em '' . 
20066	br-r04	13	45	413037	He did n't even ask the cost of this collection . 
20067	br-r04	13	46	413048	After_all , if you were going to set_up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that . 
20068	br-r04	13	47	413070	When he returned home , the station_wagon loaded with tools , Jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car . 
20069	br-r04	13	48	413101	He was glad . 
20070	br-r04	13	49	413105	It gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments . 
20071	br-r04	13	50	413128	He had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable . 
20072	br-r04	14	51	413146	He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall . 
20073	br-r04	14	52	413166	That was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand_tools . 
20074	br-r04	14	53	413181	In_front of it would be his workbench . 
20075	br-r04	15	54	413189	The old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once_more , only this time he could n't pacify it with a sleeping_pill and send it away . 
20076	br-r04	15	55	413223	How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? 
20077	br-r04	15	56	413237	How did one attach anything to a stone wall , for_that_matter ? 
20078	br-r04	15	57	413249	After the pegboard there would be the paneling . 
20079	br-r04	15	58	413258	He sat_down on an old box and focused_on the problem . 
20080	br-r04	15	59	413269	Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget . 
20081	br-r04	15	60	413284	But then , when you stuck things into the holes , why did n't they come right out again ? 
20082	br-r04	15	61	413304	It all seemed rather hopeless . 
20083	br-r04	16	62	413310	He turned his attention to the workbench . 
20084	br-r04	16	63	413318	Perhaps that was the first thing to do . 
20085	br-r04	16	64	413327	A workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole_thing did n't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned_on it ? 
20086	br-r04	17	65	413367	Mr._Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn_into a workbench . 
20087	br-r04	17	66	413403	They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . 
20088	br-r04	17	67	413414	Mr._Crombie poked_at it gingerly with his foot . 
20089	br-r04	17	68	413422	How could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ? 
20090	br-r04	17	69	413435	Perhaps he had_better have someone help him put_up the pegboard and build the workbench - someone who knew what he was about . 
20091	br-r04	17	70	413458	Then at_least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on . 
20092	br-r04	17	71	413475	After that everything should be simpler . 
20093	br-r04	18	72	413482	He went upstairs to phone Crumb . 
20094	br-r04	18	73	413489	To his amazement he reached him . 
20095	br-r04	18	74	413496	Mr._Crumb was laid_up with a bad cold . 
20096	br-r04	18	75	413504	He did n't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed_off the building of the worktable equally lightly . 
20097	br-r04	18	76	413534	The only trouble was that he himself was tied_up on the school job . 
20098	br-r04	18	77	413548	That was why he had n't been able to finish the porch . 
20099	br-r04	18	78	413561	No , he did n't know of any handyman carpenter . 
20100	br-r04	18	79	413572	There was n't any such thing any_more . 
20101	br-r04	18	80	413580	Carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's_son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working_on the school job . 
20102	br-r04	19	81	413610	There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way . 
20103	br-r04	19	82	413620	Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going_to be taken drunk . 
20104	br-r04	19	83	413638	Mr._Crumb would probably see him at Lodge Meeting the next night . 
20105	br-r04	19	84	413650	If he was sober , which was doubtful , he 'd have him get_in_touch with Mr._Crombie . 
20106	br-r04	20	85	413667	Mr._Blatz had been at_least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned_out to be the greatest boon that had come into Mr._Crombie 's life since he moved to Highfield , in_spite_of the fact that he did n't work very fast or very long at_a_time , and he did n't like to work at_all unless Mr._Crombie hung_around and talked to him . 
20107	br-r04	20	86	413729	He said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they was n't nobody with you . 
20108	br-r04	20	87	413761	So Mr._Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in_order to keep Mr._Blatz 's mind from funny things . 
20109	br-r04	20	88	413780	At_the_same_time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards to stone walls , but Mr._Blatz was usually standing in his line_of_vision and it all seemed so simple that he did n't like to disclose his ignorance . 
20110	br-r04	21	89	413818	While Mr._Blatz was putting_up the pegboards and starting the workbench , Mr._Crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar . 
20111	br-r04	21	90	413844	Mr._Blatz agreed that this would be pretty . 
20112	br-r04	21	91	413852	Without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling , which he then stained and waxed according_to his taste . 
20113	br-r04	22	92	413889	`` Now '' , he said , `` we got to put_in some outlets for them power_tools ; then a_couple_of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an ' I guess we 're about through down here '' . 
20114	br-r04	23	93	413926	It all did look very efficient and shipshape . 
20115	br-r04	23	94	413935	There was no question of_that . 
20116	br-r04	23	95	413941	`` By_the_way '' , said Mr._Blatz , packing his tools into a battered carrier , `` them power_tools needs extra voltage . 
20117	br-r04	23	96	413963	I guess you know about that . 
20118	br-r04	23	97	413970	Before you use ' em the light company 's got to run in a heavy line and you 'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits . 
20119	br-r04	23	98	413999	That ai n't too bad ' ceptin ' the light_company 's so busy you can n't ever get ' em to do nothin '' ' . 
20120	br-r04	24	99	414025	Instead of being depressed by this news , Mr._Crombie was actually relieved . 
20121	br-r04	24	100	414038	At_least the moment was postponed when he had_to face the mystery of the power_tools . 
20122	br-r04	24	101	414053	He followed Mr._Blatz up the cellar stairs . 
20123	br-r04	24	102	414061	As_usual , Mrs._Crombie was standing in_the_midst of a confusion of cooking_utensils . 
20124	br-r04	24	103	414073	Mr._Blatz sat_down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair . 
20125	br-r04	25	104	414082	`` Well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed_up nice down there . 
20126	br-r04	25	105	414098	He oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraptions '' . 
20127	br-r04	25	106	414113	Mr._Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression . 
20128	br-r04	25	107	414122	`` I was just sayin ' to him that I 'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' . 
20129	br-r04	25	108	414144	Mr._Crombie could n't remember his saying any such thing . 
20130	br-r04	26	109	414154	`` Oh , that 's wonderful '' , cried Mrs._Crombie . 
20131	br-r04	26	110	414165	`` I have a_thousand things for you to do . 
20132	br-r04	26	111	414175	Doors that won n't open , and doors that won n't close and shelves and broken '' . 
20133	br-r04	27	112	414193	`` But those are the things I built the workshop for '' , protested Mr._Crombie . 
20134	br-r04	27	113	414209	`` Those are the things I can do , now that I 'm set_up '' . 
20135	br-r04	28	114	414225	`` I 've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said . 
20136	br-r04	28	115	414242	`` We won n't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you do n't need to worry - there 'll be plenty more '' . 
20137	br-r04	28	116	414271	But the discussion was academic . 
20138	br-r04	28	117	414277	Mr._Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen_sink .
